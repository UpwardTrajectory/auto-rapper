 Put the pussy on ya like I told ya 
 Give me all your numbers so I can phone ya 
 Your girl acting stank, then call me over 
 Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa 
 Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha 
 You do or you don't or you will or won't ya? 
 Go downtown and eat it like a vulture 
 See my hips and my tips, don't ya? 
 See my ass and my lips, don't ya?

 Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer 
 Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster? 
 See the Belvedere playing tricks on ya 
 Girlfriend wanna be like me, never 
 You won't find a bitch that's even better 
 I make you hot as Las Vegas weather 
 Listen up close while I take it backwards

 I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want 
 I love your braids and your mouth full of fronts 
 Love the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum 
 Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum 
 You think you can handle this badonka-donk-donk 
 Take my thong off and my ass go boom 
 Cut the lights on so you see what I could do

 Just 'cause I got a lot of fame super 
 Prince couldn't get me change my name, papa 
 Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir 
 Picture blacks saying, “Oh yes'a, massa” 
 Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor 
 Minute Man and Big Red could outlast ya 
 Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya 
 When I come out, you won't even matter 
 Why you act dumb like, uh, duh? 
 So you act dumb like, uh, duh 
 As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom 
 Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabun

 [Intro] 
  
 [Hook: Missy Elliott] 
 Shorty what? 
 The dance that you doing is dumb 
 How they do it where you from? 
 Stickin' out your tongue 
 Girl, but you know you're too young 
 A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun 
 That's how they do it where we from 
 You know it don't start till one 
 That's how they do it where they from 
  
 [Verse 1: Missy Elliott] 
 I'm so faded, no exaggeration 
 Backs breakin' like a percolation 
 Boys to the yard for some hip spankin' 
 Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix 
 Can't take it, them chicks been fakin' 
 Y'all still sleep, better stay awakened 
 Hot new dance for the hood to make it 
 Make the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin' 
 Head to the floor don't collect that though 
 You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold 
 Pop that, pop that, cock and reload 
 This another hit, I got an ace in the hole 
 Boys on my back, playa did you peep that? 
 You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that 
 I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that 
 Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak 
 Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump 
 Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue 
  
 [Hook: Missy Elliott] 
 Shorty what? 
 The dance that you doing is dumb 
 How they do it where you from? 
 Stickin' out your tongue girl

 I come into this bitch like liquid 
 Drip, drip, then the business 
 Click, click, get your picture 
 Hermés Trismegistus 
 Witness and get lifted 
 Basic, nigga I was born in the basement 
 Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship 
 False, oh-nah-nah-nah 
 I am so different than y'all, so far apart 
 The way that I balance the bars 
 I never fall, and if I do I just call 
 The almighty yellow star, God 
 Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime 
 The car I drive, look far I ride 
 When I go by, smoke in your eyes 
 So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys 
 And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through 
 Some of this shit on occasion

 [Verse 3: Missy Elliott] 
 I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak 
 Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack 
 Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack 
 I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse 
 Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack 
 Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat 
 Got a new idea, let me switch it 
 Man, I'm so futuristic 
 Big lips and big, big, big hips 
 Body be thick like a biscuit 
 Different, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it 
 Gettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it 
 Uh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars 
 I don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah 
 You best to go rewrite your bars 
  
 [Outro Missy Elliott & (Pharrell)]

 [Verse 3: Ludacris] 
 Yeah, uh huh, okay 
 Once upon a time in College Park 
 Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
 There was a little nigga by the name of Cris 
 Nobody paid him any mind 
 No one gave a shit 
 Knowing he could rap 
 No one lifted a hands 
 So he went about his business and devised a plan 
 Made a CD and then he hit the block 
 50 thousand sold 
 Seven dollars a pop 
 Hold the phone 
 Three years later 
 Stepped out the swamp 
 With ten and a half gators 
 Now all around the world on the microphone 
 Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne 
 Still riding chrome 
 Got bitches in the kitchen 
 Never home alone 
 And he's on the grind 
 Please let me know if he's on your mind 
 And respect you'll give me 
 Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy 
 Fuck, have to clear these rumors 
 I got a headache and it's not a tumor 
 Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight 
 Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite 
 Hard to the core 
 Core to the rotten 
 Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

 It's time to set your clock back bout as long as you can 
 I stop daylight, it's Ludacris the maintenance man 
 Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission 
 You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin 
 On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward 
 No regards, close but it's no cigar 
 A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last 
 I jump in pools and make a big splash 
 Water overflowin, so get your head right 
 It's all in your mind punk so keep your head tight 
 Enough with tips and advice and thangs 
 I'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs 
 They go to sleep, start snorin, countin sheep and shit 
 They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit 
 Just cause I'm an all-nighter, shoot all fire 
 Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires

 One minute, two minutes, three minutes 
 Hell naw, to please me you gotta sleep in it

 But if I put this thing on ya, can you stay hard? 
 If not, you better keep your day job 
 Cause I'm looking for a man to make me say God 
 I'm off glass and you know this 
 I'll work your ass out like aerobics 
 So baby stay focused 
 Start off slow and then speed it up 
 Baby show me what you got, is you a G or what? 
 If you can't beat it up then eat it up 
 Put a cherry on top, whip cream it up, What?

 But up in the sheets with me aiight 
 Gangsta, true to your gang, street master

 Get a tingle in my spine, what spot? Only he knows

 Yo, mami, what the deal?

 I think you really should be told that I deal with long shafts

 Now look at a nigga and peel off fast (come on) 
 Word you got your girlfriend

 Fuck it though, I'm honest yo

 Hot boy 
 Baby you got what I want

 Slim Shady (x3) 
  
 [Verse 1: Eminem] 
 Well I do pop pills 
 I keep my tube socks filled 
 And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed 
 Spit game to these hoes 
 Like a soap opera episode 
 And punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes 
 There's three things I hate 
 Girls, women, and bitches 
 I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets 
 They call me Boogie Night 
 The stalker that walks awkward 
 Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg 
 Coming through the airport 
 Sluggish, walking on crutches 
 Hit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage 
 It's like a dream I can't snap out 
 I black out, I'm back out 
 I'm lookin for something of to beat the crap out 
 I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers 
 I flip you off in French 
 Then translate in English 
 Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back 
 Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it 
  
 [Hook: Missy Elliott] 
 Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy (Slim Shady) 
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfucking Shady 
  
 [Verse 2: Eminem] 
 I had a huge attitude, started off staticky 
 Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically 
 I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity 
 Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following 
 It's so big if I counted up all the freaks who follow me 
 I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology 
 College girls, live in an alcoholic's world 
 Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls 
 Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up 
 I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up 
 I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got an impulse 
 Gave to insult you with a pencil (Bitch) 
 And waste the paper on you 
 Chopping down the oakwood 
 Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good 
 And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin' 
 You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin' 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge: Missy Elliott] 
 Turn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors 
 We gon' get high, we gon' roll the Vega's 
 Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily 
 What you want, what you got 
 Is it hot, is it hot 
 Turn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors 
 We gonna get high, we gonna roll to Vegas 
 Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily 
 What you want, what you want 
 "A person from another planet might disagree with you." 
 "Well if you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth." 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Slim Shady, Misdemeanor 
 Timbaland 
 Slim Shady, Misdemeanor 
  
 [Verse 3: Eminem] 
 I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends 
 Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends 
 Spraying tecs at you until you see your fucking legs 
 With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you 
 Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth 
 Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch 
 Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building 
 And shot every window out on the way down to the ground 
 (Keep filming) 
 Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half 
 Suffocated the oxygen mask 
 Shit, if I get any higher 
 Imma get the East and West beefing again 
 Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire 
  
 [Verse 4: Missy Elliott] 
 Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track 
 Don't shoot Missy, get back 
 I'mma put you all in the line and I'mma watch you MC's die 
 Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind 
 I think somebody done pissed her off this time 
 I'mma have to bust you through your chest and 
 You gonna have to clean up the mess 
 It's raining, raining and it's pouring loud 
 Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd 
 I hear the gats go cha-pow 
 Who shot me dammit, bitch get down 
 Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile 
 Lay em on down, like they lived underground 
 For the sound that me and Timbaland, we found 
 Get your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now

 Fifty grand I get this on one take (Hova) 
 Look, I'm not trying to give you love and affection 
 I'm trying to give you sixty seconds of perfection 
 I'm trying to give you cabfare and directions 
 Get your independent ass out of here, question 
 I'm not your man, not Ralph Tresvant 
 Not Ronnie Romance, no ma 
 I'm tryna hit you then quit you in the middle of the round 
 Like I'm Roberto Duran, no mas 
 Six A.M. another chick in the house put your hands up 
 6:15 another chick kicked out, put your hands up 
 Spend one minute tryin to dig her out 
 The other fourteen tryin to put it in her mouth 
 The dick too chubby, too much'll make you love me 
 Now be a nice wifey and run home to your hubby 
 Cause we both know what we doing is wrong 
 Don't forget to put your ring back on

 Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through

 Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence

 Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit 
 Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick 
 Besides, kid wanna bust? 
 Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me 
 Jealous because I live more plush 
 Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush 
 Bring the ruckus, plus... 
 I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits 
 For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it 
 Socking it to niggas and rocking it 
 Dropping 'em on the spot

 From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower 
 With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky 
 I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry 
 I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub 
 Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love 
 I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed 
 This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club 
  
 I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya 
 Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya 
 Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya 
 Your girl acting stank than call me ov-ah 
 Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa

 You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha 
 Go downtown and eat it like a vul-cha

 Je braquerai les banques, toutes, puis ferai banqueroute 
 Boufferai des casse-croûtes juste pour paver d'or ta route 
 J'jouerai à cache-cache pour trouver l'cash 
 Userai de la kalash, de la tchatche, j'vendrai même du hash 
 Taulard puis jet-set, clean, honnête et net 
 T'offrira des tas d'poupées pleines de p'tites pépètes 
 J'aurai les poches vides (vides), porterai l'même jean (jean) 
 Lèverai mon verre à la tienne, tu diras tchin-tchin 
 T'auras tout ce que sur terre le soleil fait briller 
 Joueras au Monopoly, uh, avec des vrais billets

 Landin' on hundred foot yachts 
 In Giuseppe heels, I kick in the door 
 Wavin' the 4 like I am Big Poppa 
 I'm better, I'm better, Balmain be the leather 
 My watch is so icy, if I walk outside in the summertime 
 I just might change the weather 
 I'm done with the Benz so I bought a Wraith 
 I don't trust the bank so I bought a safe 
 This fur on me like I fought a ape 
 I'm killin' 'em, yellow tape

 I put the pressure on them 
 Still ain't turn into a diamond 
 I got the Midas, billionaire minded 
 Seat's on recline and I'm gettin' some head 
 Right in back of the pilot 
 Switchin' up pilots, damn and I'm shinin' 
 All my bitches with me, 305's finest 
 Don't come around us if you ain't 'bout commas 
 Commas, commas, commas, commas 
 Show you how to hit a lick 
 Collect the profit, watch it flip

 But I'm just yeah) Never front, so you spend

 Winnin' in life by a landslide 
 I know you see me, you see me 
 Your chick wanna be me 
 But she can never be me, no 
 Man I'm too stuck in my ways 
 Countin' this money for days 
 Life is so good, it feel good 
 No worries with all of these foreigns up in my driveway 
 I ain't got no time for no dumb shit 
 A lot of y'all be on some bum shit 
 First I got my D's up, then I got my pounds up 
 What you been talkin' ain't addin' up 
 March to the beat of my own drum 
 Philly to London conundrum 
 I've been this way, baby since the first day 
 But they keep askin', "Where the fuck does she come from?" 
 I'm better 
  
 [Chorus: Cainon Lamb] 
 I'ma start it from the bottom

 To give you to the "G", and never claim you

 Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too 
 You blamin' who? You namin' who?

 I do a one-two step STOP! 
 No I ain't done yet 
 Everybody in the club go to work 
 Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts 
 I'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt 
 I'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard 
 Haters I flip the bird, Got guns so what I ain't scurred 
 I came to boogy and swerve, Hang-line folk that's my word 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Release...yourself 
 Release...yourself[Verse 1: Aaliyah] 
 My best friend say she sick of me cryin' on the phone 
 Tellin' how the men be doggin' me 
 My best friend say don't tell her nothin' bout me and you 
 'Cause she ain't showin' me no sympathy 
 My best friend say 
 If she was me, she'd have let you go a long, long time ago 
 My best friend say, my best friend say 
 I'll be there 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott & Aaliyah] 
 I'll still be there for you 
 In your time of need, you can lean on me 
 Come on, I'll be there for you 
 I'll still be there for you 
 In your time of need, you can lean on me 
 Come on, I'll be there for you 
  
 [Verse 2: Missy Elliott] 
 My best friend say, I can stay with her 
 At her house, no doubt, any time I like 
 My best friend say, don't let you ruin my life 
 Cause you don't do for me and you don't act right 
 My best friend say 
 If she was me she would let you go long, long time ago 
 My best friend say, my best friend say 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott & Aaliyah] 
 I'll still be there for you 
 In your time of need, you can lean on me 
 Come on, I'll be there for you

 Beware, you're now listening to the sounds 
 Of Mis-demeanor 
 Turn everything up, all levels 
 All my fucking levels 
 Turn that shit the fuck up 
 Huh? What? What? 
 Is that a two-track? 
  
 [Bridge: Missy] 
 Missy be the name and y'all should already know 
 Been around long, Scarface sold coke 
 Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yo she ya 
 Let me grab the microphone and I'm gone take it away 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Every time I spit I blow one or two speakers 
 Top model diva but my name not Eva 
 Yeah I bring fever rocking classic adidas 
 I'm straight off the heater ripping needles off the meter 
 Here I go, flip my flow 
 Back it up then I drop it low 
 It's a must cause I'm dangerous 
 I'll be a hassle on the busta call me angel dust 
 I talk shit di, didn't stutter 
 2005 MC's in trouble 
 You run for cover hide under your covers 
 Cause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber 
  
 [Hook 4X: Pharrell] 
 Ah, ah, on 
 Ah, ah, on 
 Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah 
 Ah, ah, on and it's 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Missy finna spit shit simply raw 
 Misdemeanor always make MCs feel small 
 Stick you on the table with a plastic cup 
 Say grace, then eat ya ass up 
 Y'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies 
 Not my competition you skip or play hookie 
 Ain't nobody here that can tear the track up 
 And naw I ain't done rapping so shut the hell up 
 Keep it simple every time I flow 
 If you step to me I shall throw blows 
 Raise up like I's break nose 
 I ain't about talking I'll lay 'em down slow 
 And for sure y'all know 
 Misdemeanor got 'em by the neck low 
 Ice cold heart like zero below 
 If you wanna battle me then playa say so 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Let me tell you what I'm all about 
 About spitting hot rhymes on out 
 Yeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes 
 And the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh) 
 I be the best don't second guess 
 When it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed 
 When I say I'm tight as wife beaters 
 Missy bout to teach you how to follow the leader 
 Hit the club in a blue two seater 
 Looking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter 
 Get out with my high hill cuffs 
 Twisting my ass cause I know what guys want 
 Licking my lips like I'm taking him home 
 Teasing and teasing I'm faking the funk 
 Shaking my titties like I wanna bone 
 Bend over slow then I tell him I'm gone 
  
 [Hook]Uh, this is another Missy Elliott exclusive, uh, come on 
  
 It's all for the love 
 But there is more things that keep a man satisfied 
 And I know the remedy just to cure him 
 From cheating even if he tried, hey 
  
 Pussy don't fail me now 
 I gotta turn this nigga out 
 So he don't want nobody else 
 But me and only me 
 Pussy don't fail me now 
 I gotta turn this nigga out 
 So he don't want nobody else 
 But me and only me 
  
 I know he's a man and men have intentions 
 To sleep with someone else

 Cos he know mine's is one of a kind 
 And that's why he keeps staying 
 The pussy good, it's alright 
 Ain't gotta worry bout my man 
 Cos he know mine's is one of a kind 
 And that's why he keeps staying 
  
 Look ma 
 Yeah, you got that bomb and work 
 That prissy stuff, glad it ain't that gushy stuff 
 (that gushy stuff?) I don't like the mushy butts 
 I wish we was like Puffy over Jennifer 
 Him and her too much like I and we (and what that mean?) 
 We just love the booty 
 All we see, in 3D, is 
 Booty, booty, booty, booty 
  
 Oh really? Do me, do me, do me, do me 
 Run through me like flood go through an I-V 
 That's good I'm a make sure you never will leave 
 Can I put my booty, booty up in your spaghetti daddy 
 Are you ready for some cavi from me 
 Pussy, gushy, mushy, what more you want from me 
 Cos my feelings hit the ceiling what you want me to be 
 Oh please pussy don't mess it up for me, come on

 Eh yo Hov, tell em, hip hop betta wake up

 Down the hill like Jill and Jack, I speak what yah weak mind lacks

 Thou ain't realest, you just sweet meat in the village

 Yep I'm a top leader, I got the Martin Luther King fever

 Who gon carry us? It ain't time to bury us 
 Cause music be our first love, say 'I Do' let's cherish it 
  
 [Hook] 
 If you dont gotta gun (its alright)

 Yeah if you tried oh well, (its alright) 
 MC's stop the beef lets sell, (its alright) 
  
 [Verse 2: Missy Elliott] 
 Hip-Hop better wake up, the bed to make ups 
 Some of y'all be faker than a drag on make up 
 Got issues to take up, before we break up 
 Like Electra let go, Missy Anita Baker 
 I love Jacob but jewelry won't fix my place up 
 Gotta stay up, studio nights to cake up 
 Now check my flavor, rich folks is now my neighbors 
 I got cable, now check out how I made my paper 
 Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver 
 Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers 
 I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader 
 Black people wake up and see your ass later 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I need rims that don't listen and a booming system 
 First piece of change I see, I'm gon get one 
 745 no license to drive

 Fuck it!... ("rewind" - *echoes*) 
 "I can hear myself, but I can't feel myself 
 I'm wanna feel myself like Tweet 
 745 no license to drive 
 I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride 
 Fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt 
 Need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt 
 Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like David Beckham 
 Anybody in my way, I wet them 
 I'mma be this way till the cops come catch 'em 
 Till detectives sketch em 
 On the sidewalk wit chalk, New York's infections 
 Till I got taught a lesson 
 Couple niggas gone, couple went Corrections, Emory Got 10 
 Ty got 15, nigga even my kin 
 Got five years bringin nineteen in 
 But just think I used to think like them 
 Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send them in the pen 
 Hope you don't start ya life where I end...

 Sex so good, I can freak you in my sleep 
 Ice on my sleeve, I can make a room freeze 
 Pockets mo' bigger than a stripper booty cheeks 
 Dudes weak when they look at my physique 
 French on my feet cost a buck fifty 
 I don't swing from a pole, Missy swing from a tree 
 I'm Muhammad Ali cause I sting like a bee 
 Whatchu know about that? So cute and fat 
 I let him hit it once, I watch the dude come back

 House on the water, Aston Martin in the lot 
 Look at my watch, cost a whole lot 
 So iced out you cain't see it tick-tock 
 Yeah, I'm so hot and I can't be topped 
 Artists drop down like Michael Jackson socks 
 Got the game lock, make ya body rock 
 If Missy ain't on it, then ya song don't knock 
 You might get mopped like a floor so don't walk 
 You don't need to spit unless you live what you talk

 Boy I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy 
 Let me dance with you, let me wear you out 
 Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out

 All night ducking him, while I'm tryin to dance 
 Drunk, and his breath stink, freaky with his hands 
 Cocky with his mouth please like he got a fan 
 Can't stand when a bitch all in my side

 Givin me the side eye like she wanna fight 
 Philly known for boxing bitch better get it right 
 Can't stand when a DJ fuckin up the song

 Cuttin up the same shit all night long 
 High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown 
 Can't stand when it ain't jumpin like I want 
 Cats that try to stop my fun, take away my blunt

 I brought a couple shorties back and they cleaning my house up 
 Almost forgot to mention I'm one of the most important 
 And relevant in the street like a genius who speak intelligent, ah 
 Look at all of the shades of my diamonds in my bezzle 
 When light hits, forget it, I court a charge of embezzlement

 Two-timing from an ish like maggots 
 He tryin' to spit the game 
 What he had to say 
 Has anybody ever told you you look like Beyonce? 
 OK little boy want to boost my esteem 
 I said you need a rehab 
 Cause you look like a fiend 
 Don't want to start a scene 
 I ain't tryin' to be mean 
 And even if you spend your green 
 You can't get in between 
 Cause this here queen

 And your brother since the day you left (left) 
 Passed on and went away with God (uh) 
 But for your momma its been so damn hard 
 I hate to even hear her cry (cry) 
 Aaliyah she asked me why (why) 
 Would her baby girl go this way (oh) 
 Can you give me better words to say 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 Come one day she'll see you again 
 With the same ol' beatiful smile 
 Long hair and the voice of a hummin' bird 
 You'll be singing them same ol' songs 
 Aaliyah can you hear me 
 I hope that you're proud of me 
 Me and Tim we been doin' our thing 
 But its never been the same since you had to go 
 I ain't never met a friend more incredible

 Cuz the healin' process will be long and slow

 Aaliyah I know you're in a safer place 
 You're face to face with the creator and our maker 
 And if you and Left Eye happen to chat 
 Tell her me and Tionne we know she's much safer 
 If you see Biggie smalls up in the clouds 
 Tell him he's still the illest emcee we had around 
 2Pac there is only one, Big Pun R.I.P 
 We say one (one yeah yeah) 
  
 [Chorus 3] 
 One day we'll see y'all again 
 With the same ol' beautiful smiles

 If your radio is experiencing any kind of difficulties 
 Turn the volume up 
 Yes, turn the volume up 
 Yes, turn the volume up 
 This is an exclusive (Turn the volume up) 
  
 [Verse 1: Missy] 
 It's very necessary, on the contrary 
 No you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary? 
 But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury 
 My attitude is bitchy, cuz my period is heavy 
 I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy 
 My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me 
 And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri 
 And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry 
 The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like "Tom and Jerry" 
 My flow is legendary and your style is temporary 
 Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary 
 The words that I spit don't fit in that category 
 Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry 
 Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry 
 And yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry 
 Cuz when this album drops, you whack MC's will all get burried

 [Verse 2: Missy] 
 Your style's very crummy, that's why you have no money 
 You always looking bummy, I don't care if you don't love me 
 Don't try to come before me, unless you are a dummy 
 Repeat, you'll lose your teeth and I would hate to call you gummy 
 Rainy or sunny, battle no way, honey 
 This not a game of Hide-and-Seek, go call ya mummy 
 It's about get so ugly, and I'mma keep y'all runnin' 
 Hiding from me, cuz you know you are weak 
 You ain't sayin' nothin', I keep it jumpin' jumpin' 
 In your Kenwoods, I'm bumpin' sumthin' in ya trunk'n 
 You can say I'm buggin', cuz when I come out bustin' 
 That's why y'all be discussin' who I like and who I'm fuckin'

 [Verse 3: Ms. Jade] 
 I had a little homie named Paul Revere 
 Smokes blunt after blunt, guzzled 40's of beer 
 He would swear up and down every first of the year 
 He was gon' quit smokin', but he never did 
 Watch y'all huskey, it's about that time 
 Gettin' ready for the club 'round quarter til' nine 
 Couple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride 
 Might spit like a girl, but I hit like a guy 
 Me and Missy ballin' up the avenue 
 Funky fresh dressed to impress, we mackin' dudes 
 Music biz only reason I ain't jackin fools 
 You know bullshit walk and stackin' rules 
 Shit keeps drawin', the streets keep callin' 
 Drink til' I'm nice and uh, uh-uh, on'n 
 I'm bad luck, y'all mad cuz y'all suck 
 Please do not try to fuck with young duck 
 Please do not try to fuck with young duck

 Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy

 I broke up wit my ex I couldn't take his sarcasm 
 Everytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm 
 Moanin and groanin tried to make him feel manly 
 I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy 
 I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else 
 Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else 
 That dude that approached me at the bar the other night 
 That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice 
 I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga 
 It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga 
 He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver 
 Juices runnin like a river slowly down my kitty litter 
 Boy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you 
 A thug like you to make a girl say - oh 
 Hope he feel as strong as my po hah do 
 With you by my side its like I'm drunk off boo 
  
 If you be my man only my man I wouldn't mind tastin your magic stick, magic stick 
 If you don't cheat or sleep around ain't nothing wrong wit tastin your magic stick 
  
 [Hook] 
 I bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth

 Don't stop the way you work your stick 
 Baby the way you work your stick

 "Hey lady, look. This a jack move!" 
 "Fried chicken, pork chops, chitlins, collard greens... What's wrong with you, eh? I have to get back to the kitchen. My cabbage is burning." 
 "Yeah, I want the cabbage and your collard greens. All of it. Right now." 
 "Besides, you're making me miss my favorite episode Fear Factor! I wonder if the ribs are done. You boys want to know chef's favorite recipe for musicals?" 
 "I don't wanna know no chef recipe?! Go 'head. Get the pump! Gon' and get the pump." 
 "Well I tell you. You take a half a teaspoon of Mary J. and Ciara with a dash of Slick Rick." 
 "Yeah, yeah, he gon' come back with the burner. Yeah, I'mma stick-- Yeah... Okay. Well, you play. Play!" "I'm back. Oh I'm back!" "Now what now!" 
 "It's easy as 1-2-3 play. Next, you mix [?] Qu'ran in a Bangladesh style bowl to make some Nissan Stewart. Mix some Campbell's soup..." 
 "And then???" 
 "...I prefer Warryn style myself personally. Add a pinch of Fantasia..." 
 "And THEN???" 
 "...and a Grand sized Puba. You sprinkle one Scoop Fatman throughout to add flavor and a dab of Soul Diggaz. Then you throw a tablespoon of Timbaland and half a Neptune smothered in hot Scott Storch dressing." 
 "We gon' smother you in some hot sauce. Whatever you said." 
 "...and you serve with a side order of Mike Jones." 
 "Mike Jones?" "Who?" "Mike Jones!" 
 "It's best served with a cold [?] brew, whichever you prefer. And there you have it kiddies. This is my perfect recipe for a delicious meal. Enjoyyyyyyyyyyy!"

 [Missy] 
 Timbo, what they do 
 They try to be like Missy but they have no clue 
 On how I'm spittin over beats the way I move 
 I move so smooth in my shell toe shoes 
 Now put the needle on the record, show'n'prove 
 Since ninety-two I came to win and never lose 
 They try to stop a chubby chick from comin through 
 My belly out and sellin out these venues 
 My skills, will fulfill, those who drink booze 
 My attitude is super cool like I'm subdued 
 And those who fake I take on you and your dudes 
 I rule the streets I break 'em down with no tools 
 And Misdemeanor give the finger to y'all fools (HOLLA!) 
 Whoever doubted that I'm 'bout it check the news 
 And if you snooze on me this year your ass will lose 
 Cause I will bruise, my loose screws is like ooh 
 When I come out, get your release dates moved 
  
 [Hook: Missy] 
 This year y'all gon' all lose sleep 
 I break 'em off somethin, break 'em off somethin 
 [Scratched] This year y'all gon' all lose sleep 
 This year y'all gon' all lose sleep, when I 
 Break 'em off somethin, break 'em off somethin 
 (BIG SHOUT OUT TO TIMBALAND) 
 This year you hear a real MC, when I 
 [Slowed up] break break b-b-break break break... 
  
 [Missy] 
 I flow over a beat that make a chick weave blow 
 And those who try to compete to the wall I throw 
 So I drop it low, 808 kick low 
 Like oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
 Mr. Mos', this beat he compose 
 While I kill the track, leave your ears decomposed 
 Fake rappers, this year your lies will be exposed 
 Like oh oh-oh oh, oh Missy steal the show-ow-ow 
 Spit on breakbeats, make rappers lose sleep 
 Make labels unable drop they artists on leak 
 I keep 'em knee deep, need me, be me 
 Hardly, and basically, I do it nice and slow-ow-ow 
  
 [Slowed] 
 I'm slowin, the track down, so you don't miss the shit 
 That Misdemeanor talkin like that chronic get you super high 
  
 [Hook: Missy] + (Mike Jones) 
 This year y'all gon' all lose sleep 
 I break 'em off somethin, break 'em off somethin 
 This year you hear a real MC 
 [Scratch] Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
 This year y'all gon' all lose sleep, when I (MIKE JONES! WHO?) 
 Break 'em off somethin, break 'em off somethin (MIKE JONES! WHO? MIKE JONES!) 
 This year you hear a real MC (GEYEAH!) 
 Break 'em off somethin, break 'em off somethin 
  
 [Mike Jones] 
 See I'm a pimp that's on my grind, I hustle like all the time 
 I speak what's on my mind, my teeth'll make you blind 
 My heat'll lay you down, whenever you come around 
 Forsaken out there mistreated your life'll be deleted 
 Cause I don't play dat, you know I don't play dat 
 Wherever you talkin noise is where you gon' lay at 
 I'm supa dupa fly like Missy Missy 
 Before the fame majors used to diss me 
 But now I'm on top, I'm hot I can't stop 
 Before my deal came my shows was sold out 
 House been on the hill, diamonds been in my grill 
 I'm trill like U.G.K., you know I keep it real 
 I'm who, Mike Jones, WHO? Mike Jones 
 WHO? Mike Jones and I can't be cloned 
 2-8-1, 3-3-oh, 8-zero-zero-fo' 
 That's my cell phone number, hit me on the low 
 I got 
  
 [Missy] 
 Hold up, I see a lot of folks in here sittin 'round like your shoes too tight 
 If you wear a size 10, don't cram yo' shit up in a size 6 ladies 
 Be proud of yo' big-ass feet 
 We came to party up in this bitch[INTRO] 
 Whatchu mean I don't need you no more? 
 Cause I don't! 
 I gotta bag full of toys and I don't need none of your boys 
 So you can hit every chick on the block 
 Cause I'm gone be alright once I turn this power on, ya dig? 
  
 [VERSE 1] 
 Toys! 
 You don't get the job done when I need a little loving 
 So I gotta do it myself if I wanna feel something 
 So I grab me a toy, 'lil boo ain't buggin' 
 Now I want some affection and you ain't giving me nothing 
  
 [Hook] 
 A toy, every girl must have a toy 
 The way it make you feel 
 Every girl has a toy now, baby! 
 A toy, every girl must have a toy 
 The way it make you feel (Uh, c'mon!) 
  
 [VERSE 2] 
 I keep my butterfly close when you ain't wanna be bothered 
 Don't come waking me up, cause I ain't giving you nada 
 Cause I got me a toy (Tooooy) 
 And it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery 
 So you best believe that 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [VERSE 3] 
 I used to wish that you would love me 
 And fantasize on how we used to be 
 Until I discovered something better than you 
 I don't need, no need, your loving 
 You wanna come home late at night touchin' and feelin' all over me 
 But I don't need no help in pleasing me 
 Oh! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [OUTRO] 
 How could I miss you baby, I didn't even know you was gone 
 It's obvious you aren't needed in the bedroom anymore 
 I'm just keeping myself occupied like all women do when they are taking a bath 
 And when you leave, make sure you don't slam the door because you fuck up my concentration 
  
 Tooooy![Missy Elliott]

 Nasty friend who wanna go around humping everybody 
 Can I get a ho? You know what I'm saying? So 
 I'mma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago 
  
 I had a friend named Cutie Tootie 
 Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci 
 Known as loose bootie 
 Truly, she was a freak in the evenin 
 And if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason 
 Why she do dat? Always knew dat 
 She was hot as da nectar 
 Hector said he pecked her, direspected her 
 Cause he bang bang swang in his dingalang 
 Broke his back long range 
 And make the ugly bitch sing 
  
 Oooh oooh 
 Why you hurtin me? 
 Tell me why more 
 Oooh oooh 
 Oooh oooh 
 Why you hurtin me? 
 Tell me why more 
 Oooh oooh 
  
 Cutie Tootie with her sight 
 And if she humped Ralph 
 She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike 
 Tight, is the way she wore her dresses 
 Has she learned her lesson 
 From all the dick testing 
 Now I'm guessing 
 She's laying in a casket 
 In a yellow basket 
 For a Gucci jacket 
 Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things 
 Cause he made the ugly bitch sing 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Tootie didn't know the facts of life 
 Staying up in clinics 
 Loosy bootie made trife 
 Feeling, she got the heeby geebies 
 Quick to give you freebies 
 Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn 
 Neighbors out the window sure was lookin 
 She greasy like chicken 
 I don't give a cotton pick and 
 She can do her thing 
 Cause me and her don't hang 
 The ugly bitch sang 
  
 Chorus 
  
 So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody 
 Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank 
 Once again going around humping everybody 
 Everybody and anybody and anything 
 That's why you make the ugly bitch sing[Intro - Missy Elliott] 
 Aye yo 
 It's too many producers Ha Ha

 Your worst mistake is to try duplicate anything that Timbaland make 
 So, you gone hear this beat one time and one time only 
 And I'm gone do a lil something on it 
  
 [Verse 1 - Missy Elliott] 
 Bitches 
 I never wanna hang with bitches 
 Since I turned Missy 
 Every bitch wanna meet me booty lickin 
 My ass they kissin 
 But I feel like they way to picky 
 I use to know a guy name Ricky 
 Oh really? Don't piss me off and 
 Son, better let ya'll know ya'll lucky 
 Cause if I come out buckin 
 The whole world better be duckin 
 Cause I roll with Puffy 
 No doubt, shit turned out get ugly 
 No matter what you still love me 
 Me whack, you buggin

 It was love that made me a fool, a silly fool 
 In love, oh crazy 
  
 Repeat 1 
  
 [Missy] 
 You was always in my face, all the time 
 Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie 
 You was always in my face, all the time 
 Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie

 Ohh yea yea yea 
 Ohhhh.. mmmm-mmmhmmmm 
 I'm movin.. higher ground.. 
  
 (Ohh) I'm movin on (mmhmm) can't nothin stop me now 
 (Mmm-yeah) I'm pressin on (higher ground) to higher ground 
 (MMMM!) Each step I take (oooooh) is a new dawning of 
 (Ohh, oh-ohh) A brand new day (higher ground) for higher ground 
  
 Obstacles and situations, people places and things 
 I must overcome, cause there's a battle to be won 
 With my mind set on higher things 
 These things have become my footstool 
 I'm determined to reach my goal 
 I need peace for my soul 
  
 (Ohh) I'm movin on (that's why I'm movin on) can't nothin stop me now 
 (I'm pressin on) I'm pressin on (to higher ground) to higher ground 
 (MMMM!) Each step I take (each step I take) is a new dawning of 
 (For my higher place) A brand new day 
 (On my higher ground) for higher ground 
  
 I'm pressin on, the upward way 
 Brand new heights I'm gaining, eeeeeveryday 
 No higher place, that I really have found 
 (Lord plant my feet on) plant my feet on (On higher ground) 
 Forgetting what (forgetting what, is already behind me) 
 Is alread be, ohhhh-oooooh-ohhhhohwhoahhhhh 
 (I'm moving forward) Moving yahyeahh (for what's ahead) 
  
 I'm moving on.. can't nothin stop me now (nothing's gonna stop me) 
 I'm pressing on.. to higher ground (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 Each step I take (ohhhh hohhhh) is a new dawning of (yes it is) 
 A brand new day (yeahhhh) for higher ground 
  
 The race is not given to the swift 
 Nor the battle to the strong only 
 But instead (??? ???) 
 But we gotta stay strong and fight on 
 Sometimes you feel like your foot might slip 
 Cause it's too much goin on 
 Just realize your goal is greater than your struggle 
 Just hold on and be strong 
  
 I'm moving on.. (I'm moving on) can't nothin stop me now 
 (nothing, no-no-no) 
 I'm pressing on.. (ooohooohooh) to higher ground (oahhyeahyeahh) 
 Each step I take (oh is the dawning of a new day) 
 Is the new dawning of (???) 
 A brand new day (yeahhyeahh) for higher ground 
  
 I'm moving on.. can't nothin stop me now 
 I'm pressing on.. to higher ground 
 Each step I take.. is a new dawning of 
 A brand new day.. for higher ground 
  
 Be strong, and fight on 
 But by all means, keeeeeeeeeeep moving

 Now, see 
 The one thing I like about the niggas 
 Is that they can fess up to one of they boys 
 That they been sleepin' wit' the same chick 
 And laugh about it

 That she been sleepin' wit' her man

 Mixed with Hennessy, he got the remedy 
 Yeah my nigga into me, I can't say it simply

 Time to have relation, love makin in the basement 
 Smack it up, flip it up, crush it 
 One minute, two minute, I was no question (AHH!) 
 Who would ever think that I'd be givin up the goodies 
 Walkin 'round naked in a pair of pink footies (HA!)

 Half-dressed clothes doin whatever, who knows (OH-KAY!) 
 Nah I only get freaky with him 
 No menage-a-trois, not freaky with them (WOO!)

 For my man, I'll last forever 
 Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change

 To any chick who check my fella when we together, so 
 He treat me like a Cinderella, yup 
 Protect me from the storm like he my umbrella (okay) 
 This fella deserve primo stellar, he be a Roc-A-Fella 
 Not to Jay-Z and Dame but the charm on the chain be platinum

 Money stackin keep track and I fax him 
 If I can't find his ass then his ass out of gas 
 He only gettin one pass (OH-KAY!)

 Clockin your man from his feets to his neck, UHH 
 You gotta let her know that's a no-no, slap her real slow 
 With a right blow whichever way it go

 But how about the ladies that got a head full of fake weave or braids 
 Holla at ya peoples 
 Oh! C'mon 
  
 Ooh baby let me fix my weave 
 Touch me up and let me fix my weave 
 You could pick me up about a quarter to 3 
 Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave 
 (Oh) Baby fix my weave 
 Baby baby let me fix my weave 
 On the highway I do above 90 
 (woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID 
  
 I met a guy named Tommy 
 Very charming 
 He was on me like cheese be on macaroni 
 His game real tight making me so horny 
 Fine enough for us to fuck and be his baby mommy 
 You really don't know me 
 So I moves it slowly 
 Brush up and let him hold me 
 Let me spit some baloney 
 Baby you could call me 
 If you go down on me 
 But you got to back up off me 
 Wearing cubic zirconia 
 I told him, "Baby let me fix my weave 
 I got a hair out of place and use a fake ID." 
 Pepe LePew voulez vous ooh oui 
 You want to misdemeanor me 
 You gotta spend more G's (ohhwee) 
  
 Ooh baby let me fix my weave 
 Touch me up and let me fix my weave

 (Oohwee) Baby fix my weave 
 Baby baby let me fix my weave 
 On the highway I do above 90 
 (woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID 
  
 I used to date a guy named Chris 
 Sloppy with his kiss 
 But he was good with his tongue 
 I called him Mr. Young One 
 Mr. Young One had a big ding-dong 
 Balls the size of ping-pong 
 I had him souped like won-ton 
 I put the beat on 
 And on my ass he skeet on 
 I put the heat on young gun 
 Fresh meat he season 
 Yes, yes we used to creep down the beach 
 He was insane like Rick James 
 And with a mask he's Superfreak 
 I told him, "Gimme cash to fix my weave 
 And I don't want no excuses 'bout your baby mommy 
 Cause your child support money don't fix my weave 
 And you know nigga please me no fuck for free." 
  
 Ooh baby let me fix my weave 
 Touch me up and let me fix my weave 
 You could pick me up about a quarter to 3 
 Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave 
 (Oh) Baby fix my weave 
 Baby baby let me fix my weave 
 On the highway I do above 90 
 (woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID 
  
 I got a call from Joe 
 He used to call me J.Lo 
 Hey-lo, how you doing? 
 Used to ask who I was screwing 
 Joe was pursuing 
 Sex was good all "ooh-in" 
 Moan he was grown 
 He would fuck me 'til the mo'nin' 
 I used to get vex when he would sex another bitch 
 Said "Baby don't trip, just like Ben I'm rich" 
 Jen don't bitch, then Miss don't bitch 
 Lopez get rich, call me Miss Affleck 
 I tell him, "Baby I need a new weave 
 Because my tracks feel whack, I want to hit the party 
 You want to play like Ben then give me your keys 
 Cause even Jen drive a Benz to go fix a weave." 
  
 Ooh baby let me fix my weave 
 Touch me up and let me fix my weave 
 You could pick me up about a quarter to 3 
 Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave 
 (Oh) Baby fix my weave 
 Baby baby let me fix my weave 
 On the highway I do above 90 
 (woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID 
  
 To the heavy weave cities 
 Miami, Jersey, D.C., the Carolinas, Detroit, Louisville, Ohio, to all the 
 Projects 
 To the beauty salons, and curling irons stitching in that ? hair 
 Okay, oohwee yeah fix your weave 
 Straight up like a perm you heardTwo thousand five!! 
 There will be no room for y'all with no originality 
 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
  
 [Missy - singing] 
 You're, the reason I don't trust no one 
 And I don't love no one, from the places I've come 
 The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung 
 Boy you, bring the worst out of me (HOLLA!) 
 And I cain't, allow these tears I've cried 
 The emptiness inside, that left me so petrified 
 Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired 
 Cause you, bring the worst out of me 
  
 [Hook] 
 And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone 
 And start life and do it now maybe once again (YES!) 
 I don't know when or where but somethin must have went wrong 
 And all I have to sayyyy, is now... 
  
 [Hook] 
 When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed 
 Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life with you 
 But look what you've, done, to me (me) 
  
 [Missy - singing] 
 I, comprimised all my time 
 And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine 
 Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind 
 Cause you, brought the worst out of me (you brought the worst out of me) 
 This is, how the story goes (WOO!) 
 The others want to know, when it's out of control 
 You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt 
 And I guess, that, be, me

 [Ludacris] 
 Yeah, uh huh, okay 
 Once upon a time in College Park 
 Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
 There was a little nigga by the name of Cris 
 Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit 
 Knowing he could rap, no one lifted a hands 
 So he went about his business and devised a plan 
 Made a CD, then he hit the block 
 50 thousand sold, seven dollars a pop 
 Hold the phone, three years later 
 Stepped out the swamp, with ten and a half gators 
 Now all around the world on the microphone 
 Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne 
 Still riding chrome 
 Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone 
 And he's on the grind 
 Please let me know if he's on your mind 
 And respect you'll give me 
 Ludacris I live LOUD like Timmy 
 Uh, had to clear these rumors 
 I got a headache and it's not a tumor 
 Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight 
 Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight 
 I'm hard to the core, core to the right 
 Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton 
  
 I don't go out my house shorty, you just waiting to see 
 Who gon roll up in the club and then report that next week 
 Just wanna see who I am fucking boy, sniffing some yo 
 I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio 
  
 I don't go out my house shorty, you just waiting to see 
 Who gon roll up in the club and then report that next week 
 Just wanna see who I am fucking boy, sniffing some yo 
 I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio[Intro: Baby] 
 Uh, what's happenin? What

 Y'all don't wanna gimme my props?

 Pop-pop the enemy 'till he drop 
 Make his whole body go hibbie-to-the-hop 
 Well I won't stop 'till I get up to the top 
 Gotta blow any other state off the block 
 And I got a whole lotta chedda in my pock's 
 Better gimmie giimme five mics, gimme props 
 Say you sick of my clique and my shit 
 Cause I got a whole lotta hits and no tricks 
 Just a bass line, few snares, few kicks 
 Make the whole industry wanna go and bit 
 I say you sit, we sit, I sit 
 While I go shit on a mix like this 
 Say you spit, I spit, we spit 
 But you can't fuck with a nigga like this 
 Check me out

 Y'all don't wanna put me on front 
 On the front page, all the shit I don' done? 
 Now you wanna fuck around and grade my shit? 
 Let's talk about the million niggas who bit 
  
 It's only one Timothy from the V 
 And the whole industry goin' beep-beep 
 Now I gotta go change up my beats 
 So another nigga won't duplicate me

 And my shows, it grows, it grows 
 And I sing, I flow, I blows

 This is a Missy Elliott exclusive 
 SET IT OFF! (set it off) 
  
 [Missy] 
 Mama say, mama sah, mama can you do this 
 Talkin' like you baddest when you just new to this 
 Everytime I come out yall be like 'who dat is' 
 Be more like Ashanti and be unfoolish 
 You don't really want to bring it with me 
 You wear Dada, I sport the Fendi 
 My Lamborghini against your Benzi 
 Dirty diamonds in your ring, see mine's cling cling cling 
 Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-da-ding-ding 
 I used to get so high they called me Ming Lee 
 Spiked up my hair to look like Don King 
 Haters keep on hatin cause them don't worry we 
 Them don't worry we or me and Timothy 
 In my SE slim down my bodee-ee-ee 
 Bang bang to the boogey, oohhweee 
 Playa keep on playin watch me do my duty 
  
 [Hook] 
 Go to the floor (And tell me what you want) 
 Grab me a drink (Then what you gon' do) 
 I came to shake, shake my booty down 
 Down to the beat (whoooooooop!) 
 Stand on the chairs (And dance like who) 
 Dance like the freaks (And what you came to do) 
 I came to shake, shake my booty down 
 Light the party 
  
 [Missy] 
 I'm underrated, glad I made it 
 Independent operated 
 I never hesitated 
 Haters keep me motivated 
 The beat is penetrated, I'll let Timmy regulate it 
 And we laid it in the shaded drink a glass of lemonaded 
 Damn I'm faded, ain't no other way to say it 
 Ain't that complicated 
 Ain't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel invaded 
 I keep droppin' hits like water breakin' two centimetres 
 And I'm dialatin', radio patient 
 (Awwwwwhhh), (come on) check my translation 
 From my observation, my fans is real patient 
 They don't wanna hear the lies so stop fakin' 
 Ya greasy like bacon, keep my stomach achin' 
 If you wanna battle let there be no more delayin' 
 I hope ya did some prayin cause when I come swayin 
 Pop-she-pop-pop-pop, yeeeeaaaaaahhhhh 
 Sometimes I flow, sometimes quick 
 You was on the verge of kissin ass so slick 
 I be on the verge of makin' hits after hits 
 This the kinda shit that tell ya mami don't forget 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Everybody, move your body 
 Now do it 
 Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove 
 Hey DJ keep playin that song all night 
 On and on and on (on and on and on) 
  
 [Missy] 
 Now is the niggas over there 
 Cuz the bitches right here 
 Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah 
 All night long I hope you all came prepared 
 It's five o'clock and we ain't goin' nowhere 
 Awwwwhhh yeeeaaahh, oohhhhhwwwweeee 
 And will the guy with the cash choose me 
 Awwwhhh yeeeahhh, baby 
 I got a man I ain't seen lately 
 Go to the floor! 
  
 [Hook][Missy Elliott] {Nelly} 
  
 Hey yo, Nelly! This is fire 
 {What you talkin' about, girl?} 
 Let's make it hot for the clubs 
 {Missy!} Wooooo! 
  
 (*"This is fire!" cut and scratched*) 
  
 [Verse 1 - Missy Elliott] 
 Down South girls got them real BIG BUTTS 
 Real big butts make ya man wanna look (OH!)

 Love my guts, so fuck a tummy tuck 
 (Oh yeaaah?) Yeah! I shakes my butt 
 I shakes my gut like "yeah, bitch what?" 
 Yeah I likes it rough, tough 
 Ask your man how I'm good in handcuffs 
 Me and Nelly came to rock the club 
 Pack the place, don't push or shove 
 Out of the club, straight to the crib 
 I'll let you know if the sex was good 
  
 [Hook - Missy Elliott] + {Timbaland} 
 Pump it up! {Show me love, G} 
 Pump it up! {Let me see what you working wit'} 
 Pump it up! {Let me see those big-ass hips}

 Pump it up! {Pump it up} 
 C'mon 
  
 [Verse 2 - Missy Elliott] 
 DOWN SOUTH PLAYERS! WE GOT THAT FIRE MADE! 
 Get up on my booty, tutti-fruiti on the rooty 
 I'm a thick chick, skinny girls act snooty 
 No matter what your size, my big thighs'll do my duty 
 Look at the way my rump shake like a movie (SAY WHAAAT?) 
 See my tight jeans and the coochie 
 Spend a little looty, you gotta WORK for the booty (Yup) 
 Me and Nelly HOT ON THE TRACK (Track!) 
 Nelly, can't no-one EVER TOP THAT (Top that!) 
 Niggas we came to rock the club (C'mon!) 
 DJs better Pump It Up 
 Motherfuckers need to back it up 
 Cause we gon' tear the roof off the club 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 (*beat stops, needle crackling*) 
  
 [Missy] *talking* 
 You know, Down South chicks got big asses 
 And we a little heavy sometime, but when 
 You're from the South, we don't call that 
 "fat". We call that "big-boned". Fo' sho 
  
 (*scratching, beat starts again*) 
  
 [Verse 3 - Nelly] 
 Yeah, ma! I heard you like the magic stick 
 Me? I got the gadget stick, it's like "Go, go, gadget dick" 
 You know, make you climb the walls and shit 
 I make her wanna press pause and shit 
 Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties 
 They was doing that before I had them brandys 
 I get a little freaky when I'm in my yammy 
 I may act a little fresh but I still got manners 
 It's Nelly, felony, and Missy Misdemeanor 
 Both going down, there's just to many heaters 
 Check the records, we got records that broke records in record time 
 I ain't talkin' about the records that they buyin' 
 Lyin', can a nigga keep up with me? 
 You see I, still standin VI stackin' the ride with me 
 You struggle to recoup 
 I struggle on which Coup' to ride in 
 [Missy] See how we be stylin'? 
  
 [Hook]

 And it don't stop, rocks shine through my tank top 
 Where your bank stop?, I deposit all on one drop (hah) 
 Thank not, excuse me but uh I like to flow cause this 
 Joint knocks harder then Indica and 
 I be off the wall like The Lox 
 Night box filled with Benjamins (woo)

 Makin' all you other rappers begin again

 While 'Misdemeanor' hit notes like Sarafina

 It's two not one, Missy dot dot com, come once in the blue like free hot lunch 
 So once its on, turn it up, chickens flockin in 
 Shoppin at birds are us, murderous, don't blame me, blame the music 
 I write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go 
 I'm nice battin, I practice when the park is closed 
 I'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans 
 Jump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model 
 I go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin 
 Like Kima, Keisha and Pam, I remain cool like, like open house on a school night 
 Animal House gettin' thrown out for food fights, PPP strictly don't give a fuck 
 An Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck 
  
 [Missy]

 Hang down to your knees, its mwa the don-wan, carry on, D.A.N to the danger 
 Y'all MC's in a whole lot of danger, change up all your rhymes you need beats 
 My beats you see completely unique, forgive thee 
 See its the shots of Henessey that's in me, Reggie Noble through after me 
  
 [Redman] 
 It takes two to tingle, and two to fuck 
 I done fucked in Range Rovers to Isuzu trucks, used to move weight 
 Now you makin moves to duck, built solid without bolts, screws and nuts 
 Pussy tight jiffy lube it up, Doc came up, hoes use to hang up 
 Now my arm close hang up, my crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets 
 We don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion 
 One shot will have you ravin', like Symone when the four four is blown 
 Two minutes later I'll make it hotter, snap you from the vine 
 To my um blada a boom glada

 So what you wanna do, what you wanna do

 Get it right, used to number roll on 22's to the club, drama

 Get your master on, get your gloves on 
 Get your heat on, then get your creep on 
 Get your lick on, then put your peeps on 
 Y'all get your bong on, then you can get your freak on 
 Come and kick it with the brother with the sticky 
 Take a hit and when I feel it on a fifty 
 Gotta get up in the party and a sippin' on Bacardi 
 And we hit 'em wit a little bit of Remi 
 Feelin' when you roll with the alcoholics 
 All the other motherfuckers wanna call us 
 Hit a rhythm when I read up in the city 
 In the ghetto with the murderers and the legit ballers 
 All of my hustlers get down, all the fine ladies stay loose 
 P-I platinum ?, at the bar sippin' grape juice 
 Call the yay and rolly, strapped to most of my homies 
 No Crystalle, off poppin' Dom P's and multiple Moey's 
 Jab and bust at them phoneys, quick to work you, hurt you 
 Right now we ain't know that cause I got purple in my circle 
 Hundred dollar pillows, legit baller's kilos 
 Take a ? pull the fillos, but first where the cigarillos 
 Get your master on, get your gloves on 
 Get your heat on, get your creep on 
 Get your lick on, then put your peeps on 
 Y'all get your bong on, then you can get your freak on

 Itch nee, san chi[Missy] (Mary) 
 Ay yo Mary, I need you to vibe with me on this one 
 Uh, uh, check it 
 As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within 
 Oh God, my eyes, they water like a preacher who sin 
 I'm only human but 
 The world has put me on a platform 
 Since the day I was born to only wait for my downfall 
 But like a brick wall I'm too hard to break 
 Okay I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake 
 That's why I'm the hardest to hate 
 Aaliyah, baby girl, I've learned to love those while they're still awake 
 Sleep, sleep 
 And prepare a place for those who are good 
 In the projects and hood, gifted or misunderstood 
 I know Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still number one 
 There will be more of us to come (ohh) 
 I am a leader, a teacher, a guider (ooh) 
 Like a single parent provider (ooh) 
 Putting back those hip-hop dividers 
 Like a priest with a back slider 
 I've sinned but I win 
 And anyone we've lost in life or nine eleven 
 We'll be sure to see again (ooh, hoo)

 In the club, I see niggas

 So I cut them short like some scissors 
 They trying to take me home, they give me liquor 
 You know who I am? I'm a bitch 
 Do you know what I make? Filthy rich 
 Do you know what this means? Gotta get

 [Elephant Man][Spoken Intro: Lil' Kim] 
 See, it's two types of bitches in the world 
 You got a broke bitch, you got a rich bitch 
 That would explain what I am 
 And what my girl Missy is 
 We the rich motherfuckin' bi-o-tches! 
 That's right 
 And then you got a bitch like me 
 Who just stand above all bitches 
 That excludes my girl Missy, Mary 
 You know what I'm saying 
 But ya'll know what the fuck I mean 
 I'm the Queen Bitch 
 That's right motherfucker what? 
 Ya'll gotta problem wit' it come see me 
 A motherfucker ain't taking my title 
 Or my girl Missy title or my girl Mary title 
 What, that's right 
 See, only bitches like us are allowed to play a game a chess 
 See, a real queen needs a king 
 You damn motherfuckin' I don't nigga laying under me 
 That I can't do for me what I can't do for my motherfuckin' self 
 So when ya'll see me in the street 
 This is what I want ya'll to do 
 Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say 
 Say it along, say it along now 
 Say "She's a bitch!" 
  
 [Verse 1: Missy Elliott] 
 I was walkin' real slow to the dancefloor 
 He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him on 
 I see him talkin' to his boy on his cellular phone 
 I looked at him and all he could say was 
 "Damn baby, bring it on" 
 I talk shit but I come thru like a storm 
 I keep my piece so sweet, yeah, nice and warm 
 And all he could feel was this "Love baby" 
  
 [Hook: Missy Elliott] 
 I don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say 
 They can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name 
 I don't give a, I don't give a 
 I just wanna take him home 
 Take him to the house, then turn him out 
 He ain't checkin' for you 
 I don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say 
 They can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name 
 I don't give a, I don't give a 
 I just wanna take him home 
 Take him to the house, then turn him out 
 He ain't checkin' for you[Interlude: Missy Elliott] 
 Something you can dance to

 Still get paid to bust the right shit 
 Still get paid when I on the dick 
 I'm a prostitute, I gotta a lot of loot 
 But if you knock the boots, but at lease cop the coup 
 What I'm post to do, starve for you 
 This ain't "fuck wit a nigga", I can't crawl for you

 Just wanna see who I am fucking boy 
 Sniffing some coke 
 I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio 
  
 (Ludacris) 
 Yeah, uh huh, okay 
 Once upon a time in College Park 
 Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
 There was a little nigga by the name of Cris 
 Nobody paid him any mind 
 No one gave a shit 
 Knowing he could rap 
 No one lifted a hands 
 So he went about his business and devised a plan 
 Made a CD and then he hit the block 
 50 thousand sold 
 Seven dollars a pop 
 Hold the phone 
 Three years later 
 Steeped out the swamp 
 With ten and a half gators 
 All around the world on the microphone 
 Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne 
 Still riding chrome 
 Got bitches in the kitchen 
 Never home alone 
 And he's on the grind 
 Please let me know if he's on your mind 
 And respect you'll give me 
 Ludacris I live loud like Timmy 
 Uh, had to clear these rumors 
 I got a headache and it's not a tumor 
 Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight 
 Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight 
 Hard to the core 
 Core to the right 
 Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 (People) 
 Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real 
 I know I know, I don't even care about her being preganant by Michael Jackson (no) 
 You know what we should do 
 We should go get her album when it comes out 
 There she go, there she go, there she 
 Hiiiii Misssy 
  
 (Missy Elliott) 
 Hi Missy? 
 What's up fools? 
 You think I ain't knowin yall broke Milli Vanilli 
 Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me? 
 Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights won't get cut off 
 You soggy breasts, cow stomachs 
 Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too

 I was in love wit' you (yea) 
 And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes 
 When I found out the scoop on you (yea) 
 It was still too hard for me to realize 
 That I needed to be through' wit you (yea) 
 Cuz you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yea) 
 All the girls you runnin' through (yea) 
 Used to be best friends, down wit' me 
  
 [Hook] 
 When I'm gone, you're alone 
 You stickin' them chickens 'til I get home 
 When I'm home, you're wit' me 
 Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me 
 Well it's done, this I know 
 Seen it for myself, I'mma let you know 
 You don't play, games wit' me 
 But before I go, betta leave my dough 
  
 [Missy - Verse Two] 
 I'mma fool for you (yea) 
 But you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo) 
 I get no love from you (yea) 
 Like all these times I did before 
 I think I'll pass on you (yea) 
 Because of the way you been actin' lately

 If you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy 
  
 [Repeat Hook]

 I want it al' from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs 
 You trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws 
 Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws 
 Now I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more 
 The loss is yours 
 How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit' 
 Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it 
 To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin ' 
 Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in 
 You wasted my valuable time there's money to make 
 Scared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache 
 Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and 
 Missy You miss me cuz we finished 
 I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it 
 You don't need it, beat it, it's mine 
 Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass) 
 Keep stickin' them chickens 
 Send Peter straight to the clinic nigga 
  
 [Missy] 
 See I'mma give you your props tho 
 You like a bad ass motherfucker 
 Runnin' two bitches at one time 
 When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in 
 Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game 
 Who the fuck you think I am 
 Willy Limpdick or somebody, forget you man 
 That's why us bitches gonna stick together 
 Bitch[Grand Puba] 
 Yeah, Missy Elliott, Grand Puba 
  
 [Missy Elliott] 
 Y'all don't really know who I am, God damn

 Bacon, eggs, toast, butter 
 Smooth sexy lover more FRESH than others 
 Go ask your brother if y'all don't believe 
 I control the industry cause Missy in the lead 
 {*scratching*} Uhh, I'm talkin to you man 
 With my upper hand, the fans call me Dapper Dan 
 When I was young my pops, throw rocks 
 Always shit talk to my moms and call the cops 
 Couldn't wait 'til I was nice and grown 
 Sick of daddy mouth 'til six in the morn' 
 On and on and on 'til the record scratch 
 And if I made a few scraps I would never come back (YES!) 
 Take moms with me and a few ADAT's 
 And make a song about that and tell pops it's a wrap (YES!) 
 Oah-KAYYYYY! 
  
 [Scratched] hold up 
  
 [Hook 2X: Missy Elliott] 
 Y'all don't really know my life 
 Y'all don't really know my struggles and how much liquor I guzzle (YES!) 
 Y'all don't really know my fears 
 And how many years to get here but I'm ready to rumble 
  
 [Grand Puba] 
 Yeah, I be that throwback cat, I throwback 'gnac 
 I spit hot raps, then I check my traps 
 Pockets stop the bulk, green up like the Hulk 
 Ram up in somethin like that nigga Marshall Faulk 
 I'm a low key nigga, a O.G. nigga 
 Entertain my guests in "The Basement" like Tigger 
 Grand Puba and the name ring bells 
 And if it ain't about paper I don't waste my sells 
 So the new school new school need to learn yo 
 I burn baby burn like a Hunt's Pointe ho 
  
 [Missy Elliott] 
 Yo yo Puba, hold up 
 Let's take 'em back on some "411" shit 
 MA-RYYYY! 
  
 {*beat changes*} 
  
 [Mary J. Blige] 
 I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap 
 I'm known around the map to always make a comeback 
 I went through some struggles fightin with my ex-lovers 
 Stayed in lots of trouble, blessings then I had recovered 
 Had to pay them bills, the places I lived 
 Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give 
 I had to tell them back up cause I was quick to smack 'em up 
 I didn't give a WHAT, Mary J. would act up 
  
 [Hook: Missy] + (Mary) 
 Y'all don't really know my struggles 
 (I had two or three jobs I had to juggle) 
 And all them liquor shots from the pain I covered 
 (Strugglin from the break-ups with my lover) 
 (Y'all don't know the half) Don't know the half 
 (I'm better off now that was in the past) 
 I had to take the good stuff with the bad 
 Now I'm (thankful for the little things that I have) 
  
 [Scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap 
 [Scratched] Grand Puba, and the name ring bells 
 [Scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap 
 [Scratched] Grand Puba, and the name ring bells[Intro] 
 VA, yeah, New York, Atlanta, DC 
 LA, New Jersey, Philly, say what, say what 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 You never know a good thing 'til I'm gone 
 And you'll be spending many, many nights home alone 
 You won't be seeing me around your way, no no 
 And if you don't get it together, baby, I can't stay 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me 
 You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right 
 It's the thing that you do, make me not love you 
 So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You never know I'm for real until I leave, uh huh 
 And when I pack up my clothes, don't be calling me 
 You won't be seeing me anymore, no no 
 Cause when I'm long, long gone, I won't be back in this door 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me 
 You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right 
 It's the thing that you do, make me not love you 
 So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 To my east side people to my west side 
 To all my bitches who sat home crying 
 Over these niggas and over these fellas 
 Shake em off like Jello, uh huh 
 To my east side people to my west side 
 To all my bitches who sat home crying 
 Over these niggas and over these fellas 
 Shake em off like Jello, uh huh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me 
 You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right 
 It's the thing that you do, make me not love you 
 So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I used to stick closer to your side then a beeper 
 'Til you smoked that cheaper reefer 
 Now you loony as fita, shut up 
 Don't say a word, yep, I got the word 
 Yeah, I heard it from a little bird 
 Now I'm out the door about 44 
 You don't know? 
 Get your bags and your things take the door 
 Don't take this shit no more 
 When you leave, you can leave out the back door 
  
 [Outro] 
 Fucker, stupid niggas 
 Always think they can play somebody 
 Y'all know who y'all are 
 Tryna run about 3, 4, 5 women at one time 
 Then you wanna come back all in our faces 
 And tellin' me how much you love me and all that bullshit 
 Whatever man, fuck you 
 Alright, I'm out[Over the melody of Slick Rick's song "Lick the Balls"]

 Excuse me Mr. Lawrence, you look nice 
 Simply delicious, Missy want some kisses 
 Let's go to the crib, get cozy in the nude 
 And treat me like a prostitute

 Lookin for a guy like you to get with 
 {​*beat changes*}​

 Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him 
 Might as well try him, the freak that I am

 -- Proposition for you Ruler 
 Procede on 
 -- Well I got a track I need you spit a mean 16 on 
 -- You with it? 
 Down to bless one and I left one 
 The Hit Factory, later on around eleven 
 With my notebook, and pencil, I slides on in 
 I see her lookin mighty sexy and the lights all dim 
 -- Have a drink 
 The booze and the karmy go oddly 
 After havin a drink I start to feel unusually horny 
 Swellin stone, or well writ poems 
 Busy poundin like I'm tryin to break off pelvis bones

 [Verse 3: Missy Elliott] 
 Excuse me sir, oh gosh you look young 
 But old enough to get it to get yo' head sprung 
 Sit down relax, it's soft here on my couch 
 Or give me hands strictly you might get turned out 
 Cutie pie, 'til I sit beside him 
 Nice shoe size, how could I deny him 
 Big bankroll to help me retire 
 Me and him together smell like big empire 
 Don't treat me like a prostitute 
 Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute 
 But don't treat me like a prostitute 
 Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute 
  
 [Hook/Outro: Missy Elliot]

 [Beat slows and fades out](Missy) 
 This is an old school Missy exclusive 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look! 
 I ain't on no ra-ra shit 
 You dont wanna test how far Miss get 
 Me and Timothy cars got kits 
 But we don't drive around trying to prove you shit 
 Everyone trying to be that bitch 
 But there can only be one bitch make hits 
 I know I must make y'all sick 
 Cuz after I spit, you beg to quit 
 I used to drive a six 
 And then I bought a Murciélago to sit 
 On the plush leather seats, forget 
 Am I on my own clit? 
 Yes I must admit 
 And my ass is it 
 Misdemeanor have you seen her?  I'm the best it get 
 And those who try to test this chick 
 Where they at right now?  In peace resting in 
  
 (Chorus) 
 If you broke 
 Just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure 
 I know you broke, just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yeah boo you know you a joke 
 Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro 
 Act like you down with so and so 
 Ya whack on wax, bows I came to throw 
 I might just let you mop my flow 
 For my autograph take this flick to go 
 (CHEESE) 
 Miss don't say no mo' 
 Cuz you know what I do 
 And you know what I know 
 And I don't think so 
 You don't wanna lose a arm or elbow 
 If ya broke then just say so 
 Cuz the Bentley that you renting 
 Yo it's got to go 
 Back to the black man store 
 Along with ya weave cop a new afro 
 Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low 
 But if you try to test me I just check ya slow 
  
 (Chorus) 
 If you broke 
 Just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure 
 I know you broke, just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 In old school we used to call out names 
 But I ain't tryin' to give ya no fame 
 My credit card gonna bring ya pain 
 To know ya account just hold change 
 No need to wreck ya brains 
 Trying to see who Missy gon' slain 
 I roll solo not with a gang 
 I don't carry guns kick ass wit a chain 
 Don't let me say it again 
 I don't carry guns kick ass with a chain 
 (WHASSSSA) 
 Like a Chinese man 
 Reverse it 
 (ti esrever)

 (Chorus) 
 If you broke 
 Just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure 
 I know you broke, just say you broke 
 Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke 
 Cuz rich folks, we buy boats 
 And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure[Verse 1: Karen Clark Sheard] 
 We've been through things 
 Feels like we've been to hell and back 
 And the ones you've lost 
 I'd give my life if I could bring them back 
 (Bring them back, I'd give my life) 
 And your self esteem might be low from what people say 
 (Keep holding on) 
 Hold your head up high, I promise it's gonna be ok 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm not perfect just like you (I'm not perfect) 
 So come on let me give you a hug (come on let me give you a hug) 
 I got problems just like you (I got problems) 
 So don't nobody sit here and judge (just like you) 
 I'm not perfect just like you (we're gonna stick together) 
 So come on let me give you a hug (let's stick together) 
 I got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah) 
 And everybody needs some love 
  
 [Verse 2: Dorinda Clark Cole] 
 When you're feeling bad, some friends they can't be found 
 (Look around, look around, be found) 
 Cause some people love it just to see you when you're down 
 But it's ok, pick yourself up, start over again 
 (That's what you gotta do) 
 If you try you will, you will succeed in the end 
 (The end, I know you will, oh yeah) 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge: Missy Elliott] 
 Shake a hand, shake a hand y'all, come on (oh shake somebody's hand) 
 To every woman, every man y'all, come on (oh, to every woman, every man) 
 Tell a friend, tell a friend y'all (ooh, shake a hand with someone) 
 'Cause united we stand y'all (united we stand, divided we fall)

 Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission 
 You one minute FOOLS, you wonder why y'all missin 
 On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward 
 No regards, close but it's no cigar 
 A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last 
 I jump in pools and make a big splash 
 Water overflowin, so get your head right 
 It's all in yo' mind punk so keep your head tight 
 Enough with tips and advice and thangs 
 I'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs 
 They go to sleep, start snorin, countin sheep and shit 
 They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit 
 Just cause I'm an ALL-nighter, shoot ALL fire

 One minute, two minutes, three minutes 
 Hell naw, to please me you gotta sleep in it 
 I see you talk a good game and you play hard 
 But if I put this thing on ya, can you stay hard? 
 If not, you better keep your day job 
 Cause I'm looking for a man to make me say God (GOD!) 
 I'm off glass and you know this 
 I'll work your ass out like aerobics 
 So baby stay focused 
 Start off slow and then speed it up 
 Baby show me what you got, is you a G or what? 
 If you can't beat it up then eat it up 
 Put a cherry on top, whip cream it up, What?

 Break me off, break-break me off

 [Chorus] - 2X[Nicole] 
 Close your eyes

 You chastize 
 But can't stop my enterprise 
 Put your rhymes in a line 
 Put your raps in a stack 
 I'll break you and your singer like Jinga 
 I mean um 
 I spit like knee 
 On you this tight thing 
 Space nine inferno 
 One verbs be frightening 
 And for the sword fights tonight 
 My entourage is in camoflauge 
 Remove your mask 
 Let down your visage 
 But don't slip up 
 Cause when I was in my ship 
 That's when I get ripped up 
 The whole world 
 Fuck it 
 G-S-E committee 
 Got your panties shitty 
 Click you sick 
 Callosso with itty bitty 
 Space and Missy 
 Sip my style till your pissy 
 Virgina bitch galactic

 We high tech like Timbo's 
 Slap faces of dirty hoes

 Dirty combo when we play 
 Swirl like the milky way 
 Deep like my black hole 
 I oppose, to expose 
 Chemical gases up your nose 
 Fade away like ozone 
 Quazars, moves and shit 
 Hey yo Missy, where da clip? 
 I think I need a hit 
 Shitty bees up in da place 
 Wanna be down with whoever 
 Be all up in his face but ain't even on the level 
 I pull your wig back 
 Let of steam like nasty pools 
 That heat be to hot 
 Melt down, now up in pot 
 Count down, 3-2-1, lift off 
 Now over tize, Venus we circlize 
 And mars we tantalize 
 Comatize like Hale-Bopp 
 Smoking trees non stop 
 Then I send a televize from satelite on Nightline 
 Yeah, wouldn't you like to get away 
 To the moon 
 We shine like stars 
 Lock down like metal bars 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 Ay yo, I'm kinda scared to do this 
 'Cause Jimmy tryna scare me saying 
 I'mma give away my publishing 
 But um, it don't matter 
 'Cause I write my own shit, do my own shit 
 Sing my own shit

 You used to say give it to me - I'd say no

 And you would buy me pink pretty under-wearrrs 
 And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice 
 And you would make me feel like makin love twice 
 What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love 
 And I like when you do it rough 
 Hey shorty I can't get enough

 Come on baby, strap up, cause it might get serious (uh ooaaa!) 
 Now there will be some heat and some friction 
 Don't get alarmed cause I'll put ice just to chill the night (I'm just being polite) 
 And I want to see if you're into it 
 Intimate kisses and huggings so sentiment (ohhhhh!) 
 With you I might wanna spend my life

 [Missy - singing]

 [Ludacris] 
 Once upon a time in College Park 
 Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
 There was a little nigga by the name of Cris 
 Nobody paid him any mind 
 No one gave a shit 
 Knowing he could rap 
 No one lift a hand 
 So he went about his business and devised a plan 
 Made a CD then he hit the block 
 50 thousand sold 
 Seven dollars a pop 
 Hold the phone 
 Three years later 
 Stepped out the swamp 
 With ten and a half gators 
 Now all around the world on the microphone 
 He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne 
 Still riding chrome 
 Got bitches in the kitchen 
 Never home alone 
 And he's on the grind 
 Please let me know if he's on your mind 
 And respect you'll give me 
 Ludacris I live loud like Timmy 
 Uh had to clear these rumors 
 I got a headache and it's not a tumor 
 Get up on my lap get my head sucked right 
 Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite 
 Hard to the core 
 Core to the right 
 You drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [People in the background chatting] 
 Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real

 But the same colors ain't what I'm twistin' man

 Heavy breathing, cops chase me in a rundown 
 Flow heat, so they holler put the gun down

 I'm with the only female in the game makin' Oprah dope 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohFlip da beat

 Hehe, I know y'all know what I'm talkin about 
 So we gon' flip it like this, ooh, ooh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Before you take me out let's, have a conversation

 Let's get to the point, boy, no abbreviations 
 Don't wanna give it up too quick, I wanna build up anticipation 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Once you get me will you know how to act 
 Will you do me right (Ooh, I need to know, I need to know) 
 Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat 
 Keep me lookin tight (Ooh, yeah)

 If you wait on this love, I promise it'll get mo' betta and betta 
  
 [Chorus]

 [Chorus] - repeat 2X[Intro] 
 Yeah, what's the deal ya'll this Missy Elliott 
 Givin' ya'll magazine writers, radio cats, listers or plain ol' haters 
 A small piece a my album which is titled Under Construction 
 Under Construction simply states that I'm a work in progress 
 I'm working on myself 
 You know uh, every since Aaliyah passed 
 I view life in a uh, more valuable way 
 Looking at hate and anger and gossip or 
 Just plain ol' bullshit became ignorant to me 
 When you realize in a blink of a eye 
 You walking down a church aisle 
 And that was meant for weddings and happiness 
 And realize the same church aisles are used 
 To view a loved one for the last time 
 From the world trade families the Left Eye family, Big Pun family 
 You know Biggie family, Pac family to the hip hop family 
 We all under construction tryin to rebuild you know ourselves 
 Hip hop done gained respect from you know... 
 Not even respect from but just like rock and roll 
 And it took us a lot of hard work to get here 
 So all that hate and animosity between folks ya need ta kill it 
 Wit a skillet 
 You don't see Bill Gates and Donald trump 
 Arguing wit each other 'cuz both of them got paper 
 And the they got better shit to do: get mo' paper 
 So all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip hop back to the rope follow me 
 (Hard working, the star of the show) 
 Misdemeanor here! 
 (Hard working, the star of the show) 
 Mr. Mos' on the beats!

 Momma say, momma sah, momma can you do this? 
 Talkin' like you baddest when you just know dat is 
 Every time I come out ya'll be like who dat is 
 Be like more like Ashanti and be unfoolish 
 You don't really want to break it wit me 
 You wear Gata I sport the Fendi 
 My Lamborghini against you Benzi 
 Dirty diamonds and your ring see mine like cling cling cling 
 Ding ding ding ding ding ding da ding ding 
 I used to get so high they call me Ming Lee 
 Spiked up my hair done like Don King 
 Haters keep on hatin' 'cause dem don't worry we 
 Dem don't worry we or me and Timothy

 I never hesitated, haters keep me motivated 
 The beat is penetrated I'll let Timmy regulate it 
 And we laid it in the shade and drink a glass of lemonade n 
 Damn I'm faded! 
 Ain't no other way to say it ain't that complicated 
 Ain't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel like invaded 
 I keep droppin' hits like water breakin' 
 Two centimeters and I'm dialatin' 
 Radio impatient, pause, come on, check my translation 
 From my observation my fans is real patient 
 They don't wanna hear the laughs so stop fakin' 
 You're greasy like bacon, keep my stomach achin' 
 If you wanna battle let there be no more delayin' 
 I hope you did some prayin' 'cause when I come swayin' 
 Pop shu pop, pop, pop yeah 
 Sometimes I flow sometimes quick 
 You was on the verge to kissin' ass so slick 
 I'd be on the verge or makin' hits after hits 
 This the kind of shit that tell yo mammy don't forget 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Go to the floor (now tell me what you want) 
 Grab me a drink (now what you gon'do) 
 I came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat 
 Stand on the chairs (and dance like who?) 
 Dance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)

 Because I'm stable and able to live my life alone 
 Boy I'm through wit'chu, no more to say or do 
 Cause you're too confused, and it's over and done

 You should vote Misdemeanor on your ballots 
 Cause you know I blow your mind any time that I rhyme 
 And I'll be down for a challenge

 Eh-hee-eh-hehehe, ehehehehe 
 Yes indeed, YES INDEED out this motherfucker 
 Back with the right foot steppin in first 
 And the left foot steppin in after

 Miss-E, 'Misdemeanor' Elliott 
 Sooooooooooooooo ADDICTIVE!* included because of Missy's actual rap 
  
 [Missy] 
 Check it 
 See I don't wanna say that this is the end 
 I'll end by saying this is where we'll begin 
 Hip-hop is a freedom of expression 
 Not a freedom of depression 
 Can I make my one suggestion 
 Look at how we're labelled gangster rappers 
 Is that their only impression, wake up 
 Rap is a craft, art and a rap of sport 
 Something like a game of basketball can't be taught 
 But yet we accept the name thug, like that's fly 
 See how they covered our eyes 
 Give us names to separate us 
 Sit back and watch us beef and make us hate us 
 Say what, I'm done talking 
 Mary J. Blige, let 'em know this is not a test 
 I hear you calling 
  
 [Mary] 
 What you hear is not a test

 See me and my crew and my friends 
 We're gonna try to move your feet (move around, move around) 
 See I am Mary Blige (yes I am) 
 And I'd like to say hello (thank you for inviting me) 
 To the black, to the white, the red and the brown 
 The purple and yellow (everybody) 
 But first you gotta, oh, but first you gottaVerse One: 
 You never know a good thing till I'm gone 
 You spending many, many nights home alone 
 You won't be seing me around your way 
 No, No 
 And if you don't get it together 
 Baby I can't stay 
  
 Chorus: 
 Don't be commin' in my face 
 Tryin to tell me you love me 
 You shoulda thought once or twice 
 Sacrifice and make it right 
 It's the thing that you do 
 Make me not love you 
 Go this way and you'll see 
 Get no other love like me 
  
 Verse Two: 
 You never know I'm for real till I leave 
 And when I pack up my clothes don't be calling me 
 You won't be seing me 
 Anymore 
 No, no 
 Cause when I'm long, long gone 
 I won't be back in this door 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Verse Three: 
 To my east side people to my west side 
 To all my bitches who sat home crying 
 Over these niggas and over these fellows 
 Shake em off like Jello 
 To my east side people to my west side 
 To all my bitches who sat home crying 
 Over these niggas and over these fellows 
 Shake em off like Jello 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Verse Four: 
 I used to stick closer to your side then a beeper 
 Till you smoked that cheaper reefer 
 Now you loony as fita, cheddar 
 Don't say a word 
 Yep I got tha word 
 Yeah I heard it from a little bird 
 Now I'm out the door 
 My four four 
 You don't know?

 Don't take this shit no more 
 When you leave 
 You can leave out the back door

 Platinum rings and different things, how easy we forget 
 For it is Him the Lord Almighty, who allows us our success 
 We on top, above the charts, how easy we forget 
 Do you think without Him, you would be who you are? 
 For if He made heaven and earth, He also made you a star

 Cats that try to stop my fun, take away my blunt

 See him when this shit is over, make a nigga run, uh

 C'mon, c'mon, get down, get on down

 Break me off, show me what you got

 Give it to me some more 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [Ludacris] 
 Yeah, uhh, uhh 
 It's time to set yo' clock back bout as long as you can 
 I stop daylight and Ludacris the maintenance man 
 Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission 
 You one minute FOOLS, you wonder why y'all missin 
 On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward 
 No regards, close but it's no cigar 
 A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last 
 I jump in pools and make a big splash 
 Water overflowin, so get your head right 
 It's all in yo' mind punk so keep your head tight 
 Enough with tips and advice and thangs 
 I'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs 
 They go to sleep, start snorin, countin sheep and shit 
 They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit 
 Just cause I'm an ALL-nighter, shoot ALL fire 
 Ludacris, balance and rotate ALL tires 
  
 [Missy] 
 Ooooooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man

 Ooooooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand

 Cause I don't want, no one minute man

 Break me off, break break me off[ Missy Elliott] 
 This that fire! Ghostface and Missy 
  
 [Ghostface Killah] 
 Somebody tell that girl that her ass too big 
 I give it to her right and she let me live 
 Can't eat that, 'cause there's no relationship 
 I beat that, the next day you called in sick 
 Frontin', not for nothin', I pop buttons 
 Off Baby Phat, Levi's, J.Lo's, Guess and Gap 
 Cause it's like that, young lady, bet I make you shake 
 Like the Puffy and Jay-Z's, Dre's and J.D.'s 
 Come on, if not you, I'ma beat this song 
 But if you were bout it, our business wouldn't be here this long 
 Let me break it down for you, all I wanted to know 
 If I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and 
 Come with me and just leave your friends 
 Cause we don't need no cock blocking 
 Tellin' you this without no option 
 Tell your friends "Peace, look, I'm bouncin'" 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott (Ghostface Killah)] 
 Tush, tush, tush 
 Want to slide in the bush, bush, bush? 
 (I'm on top, you like push, push, push 
 Keep it low like shush, shush, shush) 
 You want to get up in my tush, tush, tush? 
 You could slide in the bush, bush, bush 
 (I'm on top, you like push, push, push 
 Keep it low like shush, shush, shush) 
 You want to get up in that tush, tush, tush? 
 Want to slide in my bush, bush, bush 
 (I'm on top, you like push, push, push 
 Keep it low like shush, shush, shush) 
  
 [Ghostface Killah] 
 Oh yeah, you jinglin' baby (well let me jump up on that ding-a-ling baby) 
 Ooh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy 
 Picture me layin' you inside my classic pearls 
 Toes'll curl, giddy up, you go girl 
 I'm about to, uh, do it slow girl 
 Ooh, you in control, it's in your world 
 She on, I think I like ol' girl 
 Take it out, turn around 
 Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance 
 Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent 
 To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island 
 This is the reason I came to you 
 So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do 
 Cause we don't need no representation 
 Domination, got them waitin' patient 
  
 [Ghostface Killah] 
 Now this is the way y'all suppose to 
 To get down, y'all ain't right 
 Somebody say "Aha! Ghost is back!" 
  
 [Missy Elliott] 
 Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon 
 Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin 
 You seem real determined to put a hurtin' 
 But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin' 
 You got a lot of nerve, to want to serve my curves 
 My 36D, 36 hips 
 The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles 
 And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips 
 Eh, I really like you baby 
 Do you know how to wife this lady? 
 Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch 
 Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush 
 Now shush, in my bush 
 And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh 
 Just throw it, I'll show you how to push 
 Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist 
 Come on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [Missy Elliott] 
 Come on 
 Come on 
 Oh 
 Come on!(Missy) 
 Uhhhh 
 Ahhhh! 
  
 Have you ever been in the mind of a virgin? 
 It gets hot and curious (And ooaaa) 
 Well let me take you there 
 Are you ready, boy? 
 Come on baby, strap up, cause it might get serious (uh ooaaa!) 
 Now there will be some heat and some friction 
 Don't get alarmed cause I'll put ice just to chill the night (I'm just being polite) 
 And I want to see if you're into it 
 Intimate kisses and huggings so sentiment (ohhhhh!) 
 With you I might wanna spend my life 
  
 (Chorus 1) 
 You make the freak come up out me 
 Dats what I'm talkin' bout 
 Go 'head like it's my birthday 
 Dat-dats what I'm talking bout 
 You make me say oooaa! 'til I can't speak

 Now all I wanna do is, baby 
 Is make your dove cry and make your body scream like 
 AAHHHHH! 
 Bet your bottem dollar 
 Can make you believe that you can fly (Yea) 
 Well, one hit of this sex weed 
 Guaranteed to get you high 
 Like a mutha for ya (No, baby) 
 You won't even know what day it is 
 Cause after I come from downtown 
 Girl I'ma wanna go another round, yea 
 Until you tell me carrisley stop 
 Put it like this 
 It's like fresh up out the kitchen 
 The way I got your oven so hot, mama 
 I'ma hit from the back, and the front, then the side, then bounce it up 
 And down like this 
 And baby, everyone gonna say you're a pimp 
 Cause I'ma have ya walking with a limp 
  
 (Chorus 2) 
 You make the freak come up out me 
 Dats what I'm talkin' bout 
 Go 'head like it's my birthday 
 Dat-dats what I'm talking bout 
 You make me say oooaa! 'til I can't speak

 The life you lives a fairy, cartoon like Tom & Jerry

 But yo you need to worry like Jason it gets scary 
 The words that I spit dont fit in a category 
 I guess my vision blurry my speech is very slurry

 Now I'm in the 9th inning 
 Thought I fell off ain't quite finished 
 Yeah I'm 'bout to put my foot in it 
 Talk with it, walk with it, I'm no gimmick 
 2012 there'll be no games 
 Real rap, real pause, I'm not playing 
 Haters you all lame, you ain't miss a thing 
 I'm a beast in the booth, I'm just saying 
 I make 'em wanna get low 
 Duck with it, buck with it, let's go 
 Every time I spit a rhyme it's a sick flow 
 You newcomers better sit back and take note 
 This here my time. Here I come, better run take what's mine 
 About to let off like a tech nine 
 This rhyme gon' make 'em push rewind 
 Yeah I'm so hot 
 Up on the charts, number one spot 
 See me when I drop and I won't flop 
 Missy never stop got the music game on lock 
 When I get served 
 You third, you second but I come first 
 Flip my verse like I flip birds 
 I'm fine, Yes Sir 
  
 (Chorus) 
 We hitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating 
 Groundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated 
 Hitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating 
 Groundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated 
  
 (2nd Verse - Timbaland) 
 Now I'm in the 9th inning 
 N***** think I fail when I'm still winnin' 
 So I've been gone for a hot minute 
 I love this shit, that's why I gotta gift in it 
 F*** n***** get fly 
 N**** can't talk with a gun in his mouth 
 N****s b**** up and they run in their house 
 I can smell bulls*** when they walk by 
 Heard that old saying yo 
 "Never ever cross a one day, give ya most" 
 Never ever act funny for the white folk 
 I'm a big fish remember you a tadpole 
 I like Lady Gaga. Why you let a n**** do your whole album? 
 Where you think that fake producer got ya style from?! 
 Come f*** with a n****, watch the outcome 
 Ain't no real artists 
 Wack talent get in, real starvin' 
 All you hear in music is a chorus 
 Well that's okay Timmy back in the story 
  
 (Chorus) 
  
 (During Chorus - Missy Elliot) 
 Y'all can't be serious 
 We break records, I done told y'all 
 How many of y'all got a catalogue this long? 
 Don't worry, I'll wait! 
  
 (3rd Verse - Missy Elliot) 
 Down to the 9th inning 
 I'm the real deal, y'all pretendin' 
 Years later my songs still spinnin' 
 I do record deals no less than ten milli 
 My hits be yay long 
 My songs go on like a marathon 
 Get ghost, get gone, you a dum-dum 
 Better round here, come on biters like a python 
 When I act fly 
 When I act like you better than a M-I 
 Shakin' em, bakin' em all like a bean pie 
 Takin' em, burnin' em down like I'm left Left Eye 
 Futuristic 
 Y'all can pack it up, I done ripped it 
 When you say my name call me Miss Bitch 
 I make the next chick run to the exit 
 Yeah I got a Sixth Sense 
 I'm makin' this a movie like a Netflix 
 I'm on the guest list, on the check list 
 I'm the flyest chick, now tell me who the best is?! 
 Elliot be the name 
 Elliot back in the game 
 Elliot hit 'em with a BANG! 
 Bring the hook back in Timbaland 
  
 (Chorus) 
  
 (Missy Elliot during chorus) 
 Did y'all forget?! I think they forgot! 
 They think we done 
 All we do is make hits?! 
  
 (Outro - Missy Elliot) 
 And if you want a hit? Maybe we'll return your call 
 Don't call collect 
 (Operator Voice) 
 You have a collect call from... (Dial Tone)[Verse 1] 
 You never know a good thing till I'm gone 
 You'll be spending many many nights home alone 
 You won't be seeing me around your way 
 No No 
 And if you don't get it together 
 Baby I can't stay 
  
 [Hook] 
 Don't be commin' in my face 
 Tryin to tell me you love me 
 You shoulda thought once or twice 
 Sacrifice and make it right 
 It's the thing that you do 
 Make me not love you 
 Go this way and you'll see 
 Get no other love like me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You never know I'm for real till I leave 
 And when I pack up my clothes don't be calling me 
 You won't be seeing me 
 Anymore 
 No, no 
 Cause when I'm long, long gone 
 I won't be back in this door 
  
 [Hook] 
 Don't be commin' in my face

 To all my bitches who sat home crying 
 Over these niggas and over these fellows 
 Shake em off like Jello 
 To my east side people to my west side

 Baby girl you saw I'm a don, let's get on one accord 
 If you misunderstanding me check me out on Forbes 
 And I got a Maybach, with the partition 
 And they call it Flat head baby, flat baby the new edition 
 It's Timbaland man beats that make you bump that 
 Over a Mill on my debit card, believe that 
 Wanna hurt a nice top, I'm talking implant 
 Bout to cop a nice watch, I'm talking Rembrandt 
 I've been around world so much I think I'm Omar 
 I met that [?], you the golden arch 
 Yeah I talk shit, nigga that deed shit 
 I bought a yacht just to see if I would get seasick 
 So why you fronting for, when you ain't got that 
 I got a Bugatti Zana, bitch you ain't got that 
 Homey your money's too young, you need to go to bed 
 It's grown man over here, nigga we talk that 
  
 [Chorus: T-Pain] 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash 
 Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that 
 And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that spitting 
 If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit 
  
 [Verse 2: Missy Elliott] 
 Oh you think you cute huh, got a lot of money, huh 
 I'm filthy rich and you can call me Donald Trump, huh 
 I got big bank, I'm talking big bucks 
 And I bought a Phantom to see how the back doors open up 
 Missy E on the track, I'ma make you bump that 
 I got the new Ferrari shorty you ain't got that 
 I got them whips that so sick when I spit them hating chicks 
 Wanna know how much I get two hundred grand and eat Doritos chips 
 Been around the world so much I'm like Obama 
 And I got a vacation spot in the Bahamas 
 Yeah, I talk shit, talking 'bout that deep shit 
 I call the DJ's up and tell them: "go and leak this" 
 Cause I got that cash, I got that dough 
 I make my money money grow, so I'm never broke 
 You wanna know much it costs to get a Tim track 
 Man you can't afford that 
  
 [Chorus: T-Pain] 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash

 And I'ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that splitting 
 If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit

 They call me Missy E., I got a lotta cheese 
 And you're a Nickel Bag shorty, I'm a Dime Piece 
 Don't you see the [?], got dough up everywhere 
 And the Lamborghini doors that go up in the air 
 Man look at this, I got the Bentley whip

 You I got it, I get it, I be the richest in the city 
 Talking more shit than you see up in the toilet 
 Man, you's a hater, I got the big house with the elevator 
 See the way you sit on it, 12 big acres 
 I rent movies for my movie theater 
 Now what you talking 'bout, bitch you ain't got that 
 I got the credit card that call a bill a jet lag 
 See the way the hater talk, a Missy don't care 
 I be your a milli, a milli, I'm a millionaire 
  
 [Chorus: T-Pain] 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, you in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash

 You're the reason I don't trust no one 
 And I don't love no one 
 From the places I've come 
 Sad songs I've sung 
 All the times I've been stung 
 For you bring the worst out of me 
 (HOLLA!) 
 And I can't down these tears I've cried 
 The heaviness inside 
 Left me so petrified 
 Tried ta keep love alive 
 But I became too tired 
 Cuz you bring the worst out of me 
  
 (Eh, eh, eh, ehehay) 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I wish I could change the way things have gone 
 And start life anew and now maybe once again 
 I don't know when and where but sumthin must've went wrong 
 And all I have to say....... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Is when I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life wit you 
 But look what you've done to me (meeeeeee) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And I compromised all my time 
 And rearranged my life 
 To make sure you was fine 
 Cuz our love was on the line 
 And I became so unkind 
 Cuz you brought the worst out of me 
 (You brought the worst out of me) 
 This is (this is) how the story goes 
 Those ones who know 
 When its out of control 
 You work (work) and you work (work) 
 And sumone gets hurt 
 And I guess that be me..... 
  
 When I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry

 And all I can say.......

 Is when I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life wit you 
 But look what you've done to me (meeeeeee)Two thousand five!! 
 There will be no room for y'all with no originality 
 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
 You're, the reason I don't trust no one 
 And I don't love no one, from the places I've come 
 The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung 
 Boy you, bring the worst out of me (HOLLA!) 
 And I cain't, allow these tears I've cried 
 The emptiness inside, that left me so petrified 
 Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired 
 Cause you, bring the worst out of me 
 And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone 
 And start life and do it now maybe once again (YES!) 
 I don't know when or where but somethin must have went wrong 
 And all I have to sayyyy, is now... 
 When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed 
 Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life with you 
 But look what you've, done, to me 
 I, comprimised all my time 
 And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine 
 Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind 
 Cause you, brought the worst out of me (you brought the 
 Worst out of me) 
 This is, how the story goes (WOO!) 
 The others want to know, when it's out of control 
 You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt 
 And I guess, that, be, me[Verse 1] 
 You're the reason I don't trust no one 
 And I don't love no one 
 From the places I've come

 To make sure you was fine 
 Cuz our love was on the line 
 And I became so unkind 
 Cuz you brought the worst out of me 
 (You brought the worst out of me) 
 This is (this is) how the story goes 
 Those ones who know 
 When its out of control 
 You work (work) and you work (work) 
 And sumone gets hurt 
 And I guess that be me..... 
  
 When I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life wit you 
 But look what you've done to me (meeeeeee) 
  
 (Eh, eh, eh, ehehay) 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I wish I could change the way things have gone 
 And start life anew and now maybe once again 
 I don't know when and where but sumthin must've went wrong 
 And all I can say....... 
  
 (When I sing) 
 Is when I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life wit you 
 But look what you've done to me (meeeeeee)You give your hand to me and then you say hello 
 And i can hardly speak my heart is beating so 
 And anyone can tell you think you know me well 
 But you don't know me 
 No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night 
 And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight 
 To you I'm just a friend that's all i've ever been 
 No you don't know me 
 For I never knew the art of making love 
 Though my heart aches with love for you 
 Afraid and shy I let my chance go by 
 The chance you might have loved me too 
 You give your hand to me and then you say good bye 
 I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy 
 To never never know the one who loves you so 
 No you don't know me 
 (Music Break) 
 You give your hand to me and then you say good bye 
 I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy 
 To never never know the one who loves you so 
 No you don't know me[Verse 1] 
 You're the reason I don't trust no one 
 And I don't love no one 
 From the places I've come 
 Sad songs I've sung 
 All the times I've been stung 
 For you bring the worst out of me 
 (HOLLA!) 
 And I can't down these tears I've cried 
 The heaviness inside 
 Left me so petrified 
 Tried ta keep love alive 
 But I became too tired 
 Cuz you bring the worst out of me 
  
 (Eh, eh, eh, ehehay) 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I wish I could change the way things have gone 
 And start life anew and now maybe once again 
 I don't know when and where but sumthin must've went wrong 
 And all I have to say....... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Is when I sing this song 
 I get so teary eyed 
 Cuz you get under my skin 
 Can't let you suck me dry 
 I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
 Stay true to you, live life wit you 
 But look what you've done to me (meeeeeee) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And I compromised all my time 
 And rearranged my life 
 To make sure you was fine 
 Cuz our love was on the line 
 And I became so unkind 
 Cuz you brought the worst out of me

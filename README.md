# Auto-rapper:
We're trying to construct a Rap generator that will have adjustable styles, lengths, and temperature. Ideally the user would be able to use their own input to start things off, similar to [talk to transformer](https://talktotransformer.com/)


## The Data
We have access to lyrics from all publicly available songs.

## The Plan
Access the Genius.com API through the lyricsgenius python package to get lyrics from prolific rappers, then train models to learn the unique styles of each.

## The Preperation
Take lyrics from all songs by each rapper and place them in unique .txt files to be used when fine tuning the model. Put lyricsgenius functions into .py files for simplicity.

## The Modeling
We used google colab with a gpu to Retrain gpt-2's 345mb model on each of the rappers, then saved each uniquely retrained model for future use.

## The Results
We have a simple generator that can make relatively cohesive raps based off of the chosen rapper's style and the prefix text.

### Next steps
Ideally deploying the auto rapper to the web as a flask app would be nice, also increasing the number of rapper models

### Where credit is due:

We borrow heavily from the code in [this repo](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) and [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce) google colab which is also linked in the repo.

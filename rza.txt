[Verse 1: Dan Auerbach] 
 I could take the pitchfork from the Devil 
 Keep a super-suit like I'm Incredible 
 From the deep blue sea to the dark blue sky 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'll grab a crocodile by its tail 
 Handcuff the judge and throw the cops in jail 
 Make the meanest woman breakdown and cry 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
  
 [Chorus: Dan Auerbach] 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive 
 Sometimes I feel like I can fly 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good 
 Say my name three times and you knock on wood 
 Candy man hooks, I terrorize your hood 
 Flashing Mac's on a cop the way a gangsta should 
 I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger 
 Take a gasoline bath then I walk through fire 
 Bear-hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty 
 Take the Sergeant's hat from his head and use it for a frisbee 
 Spit in the crocodile face 
 Have a ménage à trois with two female apes 
 Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives 
 I drank honey straight from the beehive 
 Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked! 
 Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked! 
 With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die 
 When the Grim Reaper come, I'll look him right in his eye 
 I'll bust in the face of the witch of the east 
 Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, (ha ha ha) 
 I'm the man who stole the golden fleece 
 And I date-raped beauty right in front of the beast 
 The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die 
  
 [Chorus: Dan Auerbach] 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive 
 Sometimes I feel like I can fly 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'm the baddest man alive[Verse 1: RZA] 
 Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust 
 With wild imaginings that you can't discuss 
 Oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for peace 
 It's a daily conflict between man and beast 
 We strive for God and a better tomorrow 
 Still suffering from the unforgettable sorrow 
 Repent from thy sins, son and walk ye straight 
 Stop talking all that trash boy and talk ye straight 
 Afflicted by the pressures of life at every vital point 
 Still, I wouldn't give an oint' 
 Or flinch an inch or pitch a pinch 
 Off the pie or every try to try your wench 
 Confronted by the devil himself and stay strong 
 You think you can take the King now meet Kong 
 Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting 
 How many MCs have sprung from our fountain 
 Fifty thousand year process to make this combination 
 I'm not giving mine away to Satan 
 Although I know that he's awaiting 
 To get a hold of my biochemical equation 
 I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son 
 When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son 
 Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination 
 99 elements, biochemical manifestation 
 I'm not giving mines away to Satan 
 Although, I know that he's awaiting 
 I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son 
 When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son 
  
 [Verse 2: MF Doom] 
 Bet ahk, straight to the head with the pet rock 
 At least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box 
 Trade a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack 
 Pay him and it's sewed up like thread and bobbin bonus pack 
 Invest in the first B-boy kid show 
 Live off skid row with jive talking negros 
 He wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly 
 And kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he? 
 Is he in the backyard or on your front porch 
 Or standing in the corner of the club with the blunt torched 
 You're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving 
 And sold odds and bodkins to old gods and goblins 
 Golly, I'm just a pest and your worst best friend 
 Who mend and rip space-time fabric like polyester blend 
 Not a hobby for no knobby-kneed lesser men 
 Or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure 
 Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi' 
 Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi' 
 Israeli issued automatic black pistol 
 The cop with the flashlight chew gum as he whistle 
 Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast 
 License, registration addressed to your lab 
 They made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over 
 Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober 
 Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer 
 Get out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir 
 Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe 
 Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road 
 My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato 
 Or cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado 
 They used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em 
 Then come and puff bowls and make beats inside my basement 
 Drunk or sober, never lose your composure 
 Stress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers 
 If you can't understand, then come closer 
 We civilized the uncivilized like we supposed to 
 Drunk or sober, never lose your composure 
 Mic in your hand, black man stand as a soldier 
 Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers 
 If you can't understand, then come closer[Intro: RZA] 
 Yea, I wanna dedicate this song to my friend Paul Walker 
 Up in the studio last night 
 Writing for myself 
 I decided to write a song for you 
 Peace brother 
  
 [Verse 1: Will Wells] 
 Every time I think about you all I see is your smile 
 And your bright blue eyes 
 Thanks for the time and the smiles 
 You shared with me 
 How you equally respected my art and talked to me 
 A young father just learning what it takes to be… a man 
 Sharing time with your daughter, you had a plan 
 To drive in the wind, surf on the seas 
 Realizing the love for a woman who becomes 
 A mother exists… and I see 
 How can this be? You were set free from your worries 
 Now you are gone in the breeze 
 Gone in the trees 
 I thought we had another day to smile and laugh 
 In the wind, how can it end? 
 I’m grateful to meet you, may we meet again 
 Paul, my friend 
  
 [Hook: Will Wells] 
 On that highway 
 Where heaven 
 Begins 
 I lost a friend… 
  
 [Bridge: Will Wells] 
 But destiny 
 Bends, bends 
 But destiny bends 
 Yea, it bends 
 I lost a friend 
 Friend… 
 On that highway to heaven 
  
 [Verse 2: Will Wells] 
 You will drive in the wind 
 And you’ll surf in the seas 
 Oh how can this be? 
 You were set free from your worries 
 Now you are gone in the breeze 
 Gone in the trees 
 Your soul is set free 
 I thought we had another day to smile and to laugh 
 In the wind, how can it end? 
 I’m thankful to meet you, may we meet again 
 Paul, my friend 
 Paul, my friend 
  
 [Hook][Intro: RZA] 
 Word up; Wu-Tang up in this joint 
 Wu-Tang Forever 
 Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang 
 Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain) 
 Word, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain) 
 Wu-Tang Forever, the Rzarector in your sector (here comes the rain) 
 From Shaolin to the holy city of Mecca (here comes the rain) 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Yo, yo, assassination, vaccination, poor education 
 Infatuation with Satan with global nation taxation 
 Fiber-optic, microscopic biological germ 
 Mad Cow burger on the market, Captain of your starship 
 I never departed once I started 
 To explore these regions that was uncharted 
 Leave your heart broken, yo I stand tall 
 Like buildings on Van Dyke's, all mics 
 Beats strike like a noisy four train late night 
 Chase got New York for the Life, we out of state 
 Can't smoke a bone in the staircase without getting chased 
 Penny candy poisonous rappers, best to chill or get your head gashed 
 Lemonhead, sour patch kids, best to grab 
 A Life Savor, I'll Jawbreak ya, Boston Bake ya 
 Then plant my sunflower seed on every square acre 
 The beauty of my nature shown through Shaquaisha I Mecca 
 When I made myself Equality, known to my reflector 
 Stay in your playpen boy, and babble for your formula and cried 
 You pacified, this lullaby from the black butterfly 
  
 [Chorus: Tha Truth] 
 Here comes the rain again 
 Falling on your head like a tragedy 
 Falling on your head causing new emotions 
 Not even... 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo, yo, I'mma show this metamorph-is as the King takes his office 
 Keep my planets in orbit, never forfeit, or quit 
 Move forward, I talk with the awkward slang 
 I walk with, the Wu-Tang, yo 
 Heavy thoughts can't be held down by the laws of gravity 
 Watch for the lime in the temple trying to plot your tragedy 
 A game rank with, the high officials at the banquet 
 For attempting to hijack the Wu-Tang Manual under his blanket 
 Can't interpret cause your brain is short circuit 
 This dumbness left your body numbness try to come amongst us 
 What's your angle? Rectangle or triangle? 
 As my truth of square drains you of your power the death angel 
 Strangles you like a weed, choking the helpless flower, you cower 
 You feel the power of the final shower! 
  
 [Chorus: Tha Truth] 
 Here comes the rain again 
 Falling on your head like a tragedy 
 Falling on your head causing new emotions 
 Not even the naked eye, can see 
 Not e-even the naked eye, can see 
 (Tragedy) 
 Here comes the rain again (the reign of terror) 
 Falling on your head like a tragedy (falling on your head like a tragedy) 
 Falling on your head causing new emotions 
 Not even... eye can see 
  
 [Outro: RZA]

 [Verse 1: RZA (Jamie Sommers)] 
 What the fuck y'all birds talking about? 
 Get the fuck out my house 
 'Fore I grab you by your hair and slap dick to your mouth 
 Bob Digi, yeah you know who is he 
 Girl, I fucking slave trade your ass like Kizzy Kinte 
 (But wait, fuck you motherfucker) 
 You wish you could fuck 
 Bitch, all you can do is dick suck 
 (Your ass can't fuck, that's why your wife left your monkey ass) 
 Fuck that, you don't cook, you don't clean, or press my jeans 
 You don't scrub or wash clothes 
 Or buy food for making (???), bitch 
 You don't read to the seeds 
 All you do is watch tv and smoke weed 
 Get your nails done and feet, scrub the hairweave 
 Sleep all day, eat, gain weight, can't breathe 
 Talking about you're going to leave? 
 Then bitch leave! What the fuck you're waiting for? 
 Hit the door, I ain't taking this shit no more! 
 Spending all my cream on Gucci, Phillies and Coach 
 Before you moved to my lab, bitch, I ain't never seen a roach 
 Stains on my carpet, bathroom's more like a fish market 
 Take all the space in my closet, where the fuck's your logic? 
 Disrespecting my old earth, aborted my child birth 
 And every day I catch my credit card inside your purse 
 You can't speak a sentence without a curse 
 Talking 'bout you're going to be a nurse 
 Bitch, to be a nurse you got to go to shool first! 
 When I first met you, you was a ho 
 I tried to reform you, bomb you, warn you and teach you 
 But couldn't reach you, and you're still a ho 
 Your father said you was a ho 
 And when you leave me, bitch you're gonna be a ho 
 Celluloid and gargoyle feet, I'd rather beat my meat 
 That raggy ass pussy a starving dog wouldn't eat 
 Started with the body of a model 
 Pussy tight as a pharmaceutical bottle 
 And you could swallow a whole avocado 
 And two forty ounce bottles 
 To the end of the world, which to I would follow 
 Now, when I fuck you, the shit echos cause you pussy is so hollow 
 Turn your fat ass sideways 
 Your stretch marks look like the US highways 
 Fuck a new nigga every friday 
 Talking 'bout bust a nut, bitch I'll bust yo guts! 
 (You come so quick nigga) 
 Wonder why I come so quick? 
 With that wide ass pussy and soggy tits? 
 I'm trying to get the shit over with, and go to sleep! 
 But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend 
 Bet that baby we fuck for two and a half hours to three 
 You'd better study the 1-14 knowledge culture degree 
 About M-G-T, and G-C-C 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Cause you ain't shit, and your mother ain't shit 
 And your sister ain't shit, and your pussy ain't shit 
 That weave ain't shit, your ass ain't shit 
 Girl you ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit 
  
 [Outro: RZA (Jamie Sommers)] 
 But fuck it, yo, let me get this fucking phone 
 (Yeah, get the motherfucking phone 
 Quit motherfuckers in our fucking 
 Business. End the fuck, or I'll pull 
 The motherfucking chord out of the

 Get these motherfuckers out this

 (Cause you ain't going to steal this motherfucking phone)[Intro: Holocaust, (Ms. Roxy)] 
 (Bobby Digital) Wu-Tang Killa Beez 
 (It's all about Bobby, I'm floating in your galaxy) 
  
 [Verse 1: Holocaust] 
 You falling down a endless tunnel of doom reality 
 Graphically my Killa Bee family stings the galaxy 
 Insanity, titanium stomach devouring Guinness 
 My flesh is solid stone despite my outer appearance 
 Still disease kills viruses, planets and racial creatures 
 Made MCs sprout tumours so bad, lost facial features 
 Waste your peoples left out in the rain, fountains of pain 
 Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name 
 Holocaust, black man whose veins littered with thorns 
 Back smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed 
 Swarm dorms, sting birds, fling verbs like mean curves 
 Strike three, mics flee, I infect 'em with green germs 
 Ringworm cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly mastery 
 My felony melody has to be a bastard's masterpiece 
 Stop grafting me, chump-ass niggas eyeing me, tempt me 
 I'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty 
 Spitting darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hideout 
 Rock crush or German suplex, watch spines slide out 
 The side route, forearm bash with twenty jabs 
 On the ave or your lab, get stabbed and bloodied bad 
 While I'm sipping herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds 
 Bitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees 
 Circle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus 
 Got Oscar nominee MCs stuck to my hatchet 
 Drastic indescribable pain, I injure bars 
 While Bobby's throwing razor CDs like ninja stars 
  
 [Break: RZA] 
 Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh 
 Yo, yo, drop down a manhole, yo I rap ammo 
 Blows out your candle, check, yo 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Drop down a manhole, I rap ammo, blows out your candle 
 Have Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Gano 
 Release the info, .44 increase your heart tempo 
 Scared your ass, you jumped through a closed window 
 To a hundred beats per a second, my mic's secret weapon 
 Infuriate your style to that of Led Zeppelin 
 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Hanna-Barbera 
 World of Super Adventure couldn't give a proper word 
 Of the scripture of my manner 
 You're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal 
 MCs delight popcorn, we popping every kernel 
 Jot this in your journal, we hot like a thermal 
 Nuclear explosion, undermine control of your country 
 Like the Federal Enforcement Management Agency 
 My technique be vocabulary freak 
 C-cyphers say my divine is like Dante's Peak 
 At most, you'll be trapped off in Patmos 
 Get smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast 
 King Cobra black brew pack and bare foot 
 On the roof dusted out, waiting for chariots 
 Popping like Orville Redenbacher or Betty Crocker 
 The Pop Secret is the .45 Glock popper 
 Control men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard 
 American Express privileges, blood spillage 
 We got more bars then billets, Star-Spangled Banner 
 Soldier stand up, Cobra Commander stop the propaganda 
 Thirty shot banana clip, full-loaded, radar scanners get decoded 
 Digital warfare torments your head, eyes bloated 
 Heads exploded, poison darts quoted 
 American eagle stinging up Blue Beetle Bailey 
 On the rocks mixed with Hennessey daily 
 Keep thee scaly Israeli niggas from the Clan 
 We bide the Amish that'll harness the promised land 
  
 [Verse 3: Dr. Doom] 
 You can't escape from the Doctor of Doom, my lyrics zoom on buffoons 
 And take flight like witches brooms at full moon 
 On all you Dum-Dums, wash your filthy rhymes away like soap scum 
 The warlord swing flaming swords just like a shogun 
 Of the darkness, my scriptures cause arson like flaming arches 
 My Killa Bee sting remains accurate like a marksman 
 So take precaution, we attack like black Martians 
 Corner the market by using digital strategies 
 Reefer sparks my acid battery, y'all niggas flatter me 
 With all that tough talk, I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock 
 From the outside or the inside, create intense rides 
 When my pen glides all MCs will get their head fly 
 For talking shit, lyrics always strike throughout my dungeon pit 
 Killa Bees must reign supreme throughout the continent 
 We conquered it, motherfuckers 
  
 [Verse 4: Ghostface Killah] 
 The beat terminal, exquisite young Cooley High production 
 Caught up in the hollow head suction 
 Ten pogo sticks, two black belts that break bricks 
 Diet Coke meetings with the rich, I'm faithfully 
 Married to Rap, we've been engaged for twelve years 
 Tyson bit Holyfield's ear, we love the sport 
 Look out your window, now see, pull up the shade 
 Y'all be amazed, me Tony Starks spaceship 
 Ran by a Duracell, the only man out walked through Hell 
 Dick swinging like shit went well 
 Call it the mighty Joe Young, double swirl slush 
 Wonder Woman's sapphire shit with the pearls 
 It looked real nice yo, heavy on the gravy 
 Dirt bagged the secretary in the graze 
 She typed eighty words from whirlwinds to whirlpools 
 Openly sea, watch the Earth spin, Sunny dance with the serpent 
 Who shot JJ it was Mudbone, the same nigga riding the train 
 Same nigga with his name on his jacket 
 Swift and changeable, inhaled the bad bag of that Jason 
 Fell out twice in the basement, straight up and down y'all[Intro: RZA] 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up... 
  
 [Hook] 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
  
 [RZA] 
 The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes 
 While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes 
 Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up 
 A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up 
 Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up 
 My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up 
 And cops flood the block, no way to eat 
 So I dropped a half a G on a rented SP 
 1200 Sampler, and a Yamaha Four-Track 
 The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back 
 While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up 
 Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up 
 Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up 
 Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck 
 When I was stressed I would head to the rest 
 Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed 
 Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat 
 In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP 
 We went platinum, *whoo-peesh*, yeah we flatten 'em 
 Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em 
 Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em 
 All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em 
 You can't stop us, you can't block us 
 Rock us or mock us, knock us or top us 
 Better sit back and watch us... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Inspectah Deck] 
 Can't stop me man... 
 No matter how hard, you better go hard 
 So hard, if you gonna try and stop me now 
 I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild 
 Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down 
 Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride 
 Without a homicide, case and trial 
 It's a long time comin', long nines bustin' 
 Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin' 
 Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin' 
 The shit that I been through, things that I've seen 
 The chicks that I ran through, places I've been 
 I'm a victim of the very song I sing 
 That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it 
 Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics 
 I'mma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is 
 Either you pay with your life, or you pay dues and homage 
  
 [Hook 2X][A Word From RZA]: 
 Yo, peace and blessings 
 My name is the RZA, from the all mighty Wu-Tang Clan 
 I'm zonin' in with my home girl, SZA 
 Self-savior, Zig-zag-zig, Allah 
 Yeah, I think you can take it that far mama 
 You know what I mean? 
 Cut loose the drama 
 No melodrama 
 Rise to the top 
 Claim yo karma 
 And it's my honor 
 To drop this lesson 
 It's my honor 
 To give this blessing 
  
 [S (Self-savior)]: 
 Self-savior 
 Sophisticated syncopations 
 Smokers several strands of high potency stimulation 
 A soulful songstress 
 See, sometimes a woman is the strongest one inside the cypher 
 So why y'all niggas all getting hyper, huh? 
 She could be stubborn born, yeah, but she could never be stupid 
 You may think that she's being strange 
 Nah, she's being wise and being studious 
  
 [Z (Zig-Zag-Zig)]: 
 Reverse the S, it's stress girl, return it back to a Z 
 The zig-zag-zig, yeah 
 So find a zig in me 
 The Xena who could rise again 
 Up on the ashes like a phoenix 
 Usable zillionaires 
 So fuck all y'all rap billionaires 
 Haha, hey 
 Self-savior boy, we told you, you better save yourself 
 You stupid motherfuckers, you putting wealth before yo health 
 In every drop of semen, there's a potential human being 
 In every man that's born through the womb of a woman is born here as a free man 
 In every womb will carry the chance for life and infinity 
 In every woman she has inside her divine identity 
 But y'all got it backwards boy 
 So you need to get smacked backwards boy 
 Back into the past 
 Yo, let's backtrack their ass 
 And zero out these zombies 
 These weak ass Uncle Tommys 
 My- 
  
 [A (Allah)]: 
 Yo, see Allah's the all I see and the all knowin', the all flowin' 
 Over land, sea, sky and the ocean 
 The controller of space, time, and motion 
 From darkness of the universe to the first letter of this verse 
 Amplified through your Apple device 
 Appearing as a voice, her, SZA 
 Cut through them, paper thin 
 Open up their ears and let the melodies enter in 
 And whether sober or drunk, smokin' bongs, or smokin' blunts 
 Let's get it mama, they can't front 
 With self-savior, zig-zag-zig through apex 
 Nah, ain't nothin' change 
 But yo, yo baby girl 
 Do what the fuck you gon' do and shine on these niggas, aight 
 So they can understand, yo[Hook girl] 
 Bobby, come on baby 
 Let's lay down and let's get some sleep (Word) 
 Bobby.. come here baby 
 Lay down, let's get some sleep 
  
 [RZA] 
 One two, yo, 280 grains of gun powder stuffed inside the cartridge 
 Split ya wig, drive you off the Geothal's Bridge 
 Wild like a fiend of Herkimer 
 Scholastic type brain like Ivan van Sertima 
 I've got wolves that'll murder ya for a veggie burger 
 Spaghetti heads, meet the heavy burner 
 I put a oodle up in ya noodle 
 Then I head to the dread spot for a bag of that doodoo 
 Black photographic, I don't know no magic 
 But I know how to hold a 4 automatic 
 Add a nickel to it son if you have to add it 
 Better make sure ya kevlaar is steel padded 
 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I've got beaucoup cess 
 Get pupu from best bitches plus I shoot through vests 
 Drive Fast Cars, crash bars at 5 AM 
 Stash jars of hash inside the backyard 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 I can't sleep like a child on Christmas Eve 
 Like a tender head girl in a shop gettin' a weave 
 Like a woman in labour about to produce the seed 
 Or Method Man with PlayStation and an ounce of weed 
 Some say it's hard to distinguish, my form of broken English 
 When spoke, the light I provide it cannot be extinguished 
 Or eclipsed by a 1000 moons, I stay in tune 
 And praise the Most High past the day of the doom 
 I squeeze black rubber grip 22 D's on the rims 
 Squeal out, leavin' black rubber skids, other kids 
 Couldn't match to the old Pistol Pete Rock, beat stop 
 The heat pops, you better get your mother kid 
 This is Bad News Bears, like Eddie Munster 
 I keep a dragon under my stairs 
 Plus a gun in my hat, ain't no runnin' from that 
 Ain't no runnin' with that pack 
 The Poison Apple, dunn, I crush Kings

 Blade... Ready to die 
 I was born ready, motherfucker 
 Daywalker, daywalker 
 Daywalker, daywalker 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo... Yo, yo 
 It's the feast of the blood with sin, unleash the beast within 
 I walk around, with the strength of a hundred men 
 You best be gone before I count to ten 
 Blood dripping from my canine, like a fountain pen 
 It seems I've been asleep for a thousand years 
 The way my world has changed, it brings me a thousand tears 
 Prince of darkness, they walk through the rays of light 
 To this breed of vampire, I'm the prototype 
 The shape shifting, mirror image, flash phototype 
 To everlast, an original red blood O type 
 "He was born perfect, and just like the great white shark, this guy has never had to evolve" 
  
 Daywalker, daywalker 
 Daywalker, daywalker 
 Daywalker, daywalker 
 Daywalker, daywalker

 Try to use my name, that's fatal 
 Tried to claim my fame but that's fatal 
 About to bring the pain, that's fatal 
 Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal 
  
 Try to use my name, that's fatal 
 Tried to claim my fame but that's fatal 
 About to bring the pain, that's fatal 
 Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal

 Come on, walk with me 
 Come on, walk with me 
 Come on, walk with me 
  
 "You're not immortal, I must of heard hundreds of rodents make the same claim, and each one of them tasted the bitter end of my sword" 
  
 [RZA] 
 I strike back with a vengeance, the father of descendents 
 And I can't be deflected, by your silver cross pendants 
 Blow the holy water, you make the false images 
 One swing from the sickle, ahh, your life diminishes 
 Sting like the scorpion, strike with the force of ten 
 My blood is known to revitalize corpse of men 
 In the last days, they said the dead would walk again 
 The blind, deaf and the dumb will talk again

 [Hook][Intro: RZA] 
 You know they say 
 In every mans life, there comes a time 
 When you got struck by the arrow of cupid 
 By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman 
 And sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life 
 And it brings the storm, sing about it 
  
 [Verse 1: Xavier Naidoo] 
 There is more to love like this 
 Love is more then just a kiss 
 Will we take you to that step 
 Will we do more than just connect 
 And will you, bring the thunder in my life 
 And the fire in my eyes 
 Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and 
 Everything far will be so near 
  
 [Refrain: Xavier Naidoo] 
 I have never felt thunder (thunder) 
 And lightning (lightning) like this 
 I have never been strucked by (strucked by) 
 A wonder (a wonder) like this 
  
 [Verse 2: Xavier Naidoo] 
 Ich könnte tagelang nur von dir erzählen 
 Ohne deinen Namen auch nur einmal zu erwähnen 
 Unter Schmerzen oder unter Tränen 
 Würde dein Name als meine Linderung dienen 
 Jede deiner Bewegungen sind erstrebenswert und 
 Jede Stunde mit dir ist so lebenswert und 
 Nichts ist vergleichbar mit dem, was du gibst 
 Mit dem, was du zeigst, wie du lebst und wie du liebst 
  
 [Chorus: Xavier Naidoo] 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
  
 [Verse 3: Xavier Naidoo] 
 Schöne Tage mit dir sind kostbar 
 So kostbar wie der Weg zum Morgenstern 
 Ich zelebriere sie wie einen Festtag 
 An dem ich immer wieder neues von dir lern' 
 Im Moment ist es das Schönste, dich zu kennen 
 Dich zu kennen, ist wie das Beste, das ich hab' 
 Verzeih mir, aber dieses sag' ich nochmal 
 Deinen Namen zu nennen, ist wohl das Schönste, was ich sag' 
  
 [Chorus: Xavier Naidoo] 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schön ist wie du[Hook: Bobby Digital] 
 From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene 
 Now Why See everything 
 Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats thrown inside of bing 
 Bobby Digital got the golden seal sting 
  
 [Verse 1: Bobby Digital] 
 Rhyme star, I write a hundred thousand dollar bar 
 My ten strike combo deletes your power bar 
 Dr. Octopus tentacle, sing a simple song 
 Bob Digital instrumental, nothing's identical you biter 
 Non-writer, Mr. Potato Head, Ore-Ida deep-fried crinkle cut 
 One single cut fucks your whole LP up 
 You must be stupid you liar, I'm the purifier, live wire 
 Hip Hop reviver, a suicide mission you're committing 
 Go against the Wu-Tang henchmen 
 Perfect precision marksman, spit darts and rip charts and 
 Archery, shots aimed at your heart and 
 Daffy duck us, we still bring the motherfucking ruckus 
 Project Killa Hill be the buckest 
 Smoke blunts drink Bud Light beer with Buzz Lightyear 
 Went from here to infinity but I'm right here 
 Bobby Digital, overthrow your whole citadel 
 Mister Pitiful, your whole rap stack is despicable 
 Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish 
 Cherish every moment of this love before you perish 
 Bitch - ka-chich ka-chich - watch me switch 
 Looking for a bird I can hitch 
 Enter your atmosphere, dig your pussy out like a pap smear 
 Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear, smack your rear 
 Vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider 
 Up inside ya, dick applehead opens up your clit wider 
 Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a bride of

 Stuck to your ass like a Victoria's Secret wedgie

 [Verse 2: Method Man] 
 Drink a Heineken, as we go inside the mind again 
 Never minding men, dropping gem, can he shine again 
 Most definite, let this be my last will and testament 
 For the pessimist, exercise for the Exorcist 
 Johnny Treacherous, like Three 
 I'm supposed to be perpetuous 
 Decimate the poetry and everything that's close to me 
 The lecherous, Jonathan 
 King of the seven seas, battle with Leviathan, the Methodist 
 Poly to your deficit, hit it up 
 If I can't live it up somebody gotta give it up 
 John J., blow em out the water Dr. Bombay 
 Your bitch look like Strange, rubbing me the wrong way 
 Burn one and saute, bringing you different ways of sword play 
 They busting bullets over Broadway, deep cover 
 I'm like Larry when the fish burn, I burn rubber 
 Cause I'm not an easy lover 
 Ten to midnight, butt naked with a knife 
 Ask my A-alikes, I've been crazy all my life 
 Hard time homicide, time fly, do or die 
 Crooked S and crooked I, scripture from the darkside 
 Johnny 5, I reside, in the killa bee hive 
 Only the strong gon' survive 
  
 [Outro: Method Man] 
 From the depths of the Killa to the top of Now Born 
 Wildin' on Staten Island be the poet John John 
 Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp 
 Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip 
 From the depths of the Killa to the top of Now Born 
 Wildin' on Staten Island be the poet John John 
 Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp

 You know us to be robust, the greatest crew since Cold Crush 
 This poisonous slang keep MCs avoiding us 
 Can't think about the proper remedies for destroying us 
 Your best bet black is sit back and start enjoying us 
 And run your commissary, attack your coronary 
 I'm with every revolutionary 
 Honorary and sonic electronic brain like Johnny Mnemonic 
 Get boosted from the sorrow and went Wu-tonic 
 You be fickle, get your tongue thrown into a jar of pickle 
 To serve to your bird with cheese and pumpernickel 
 Beefsteak Charlie, a classic like Marley Marl 
 Tie your ass down and run you over with a trolley car 
 My nigga Lucky keep 'em Bucky like Dent 
 Intent, read the fine print 
 It says, "Do not enter or cross the lines 
 You be tossed behind and forced to submit to the rhyme"

 .44 in the holster strapped tight by the Velcro 
 Steel padded vest on the chest, arm knife on the elbow 
 Pointed rings resemble Killa Bee stings 
 Instrumental of slinging swords, taking a buck bring 
 Rain, hail, snow, earthquakes, search your mental birth date 
 50 straight push-ups keep the body in perfect shape 
 Just got hit on the hip by this bird talking 'bout 
 She got a blister on her lip, that comes from not gargling after sucking 
 I'm toggling the buttons on my cell-phone 
 Call my nigga Tone, the well known 
 Bubble goose feathers made 'em think it's Carl Weathers 
 Solid chrome Beretta 9s stuffed inside the Wu leather 
 Hot shots melt through your pleather 
 Never Ending Story not from the Land of Nether 
 We fight for our rights to the death like Medgar Evers

 Up from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil 
 Ol' Earth kept a nigga spoilt 
 Though the reigns to my veins remain royal, burning up 
 High speed dub, my CD spins like a hub-cap on a Ac' 
 Tre-pound snub rap we might joust 
 Fresh spring water from the Alps 
 Stalked like a tomahawk, Indian bitch you get scalped 
 Like a ticket sold in Cleveland, you feel me in 
 And now I stream up your bone marrow 
 Wu-Tang song last long as Christmas carols 
 Niggas throw darts, I'm shooting flaming arrows 
 Pierce through your physical faculties with pinpoint accuracy 
 You don't wanna battle me

 [Hook 2][Verse 1-Blake Perlman] 
 When the Earth collides 
 Two hearts, two souls combine 
 One love of humankind, in heaven's name 
 No time for fear or blame 
 Inside, we are the same 
  
 [Hook-Blake Perlman] 
 We feel it all, we feel the rise before the fall 
 Although divided us, we feel it all, we feel it all 
  
 [Verse 2-Blake Perlman 
 We feel it all, the rise and fall 
 We drift inside each other, all we have is one another 
 United we can never fall 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3-RZA] 
 The great scientist minds, militaries combined 
 Formed the greatest weapons to defend mankind 
 From the bottomless pit, it's the apocalypse 
 Egypt, Okinowa, they threatened the populous 
 Nations of man must stand its terror 
 Two hearts ripped apart, they come together 
 Some bonds rejoined they cannot be severed 
 Brother, true to color, we all need each other 
 We look beyond these borders just to see each other 
 The fate of the world is upon our shoulders 
 A soldier tell his father goodbye, you can see the proudness 
 A gleam of hope appears in his eye 
 No one knows for whom the bell tolls 
 A strong might body, hundred tons of steel 
 Kaiju, facing the enemy that stands before us 
 We feel it all, they're trying to destroy us! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro-Blake Perlman] 
 We drift inside each other, all we have is one another 
 United we can never fall"I wanna stay with you, forever" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force 
 My mind blind force is known to blow time off course 
 Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse 
 Strapped down, I'd still get my point across 
 Allah is father of all 
 You debate whether big, whether small 
 Whether short, whether tall 
 Whether dense, whether length 
 Whether strength, whether width 
 Either man, animal, bird or fish 
 Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes 
 Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate 
 The man of steel couldn't bend me 
 Time couldn't end me 
 Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me 
 Understand the equality, God in a bodily form 
 Lettin' my knowledge be born 
 Lettin' my knowledge be born 
  
 "I wanna stay with you, forever" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin' 
 Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron 
 Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless 
 We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish 
 I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie 
 I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie 
 The runaway train with no track 
 I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack 
 T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs 
 Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms 
 Guns go off, bustin' all directions 
 D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection 
  
 "With you forever" 
 "Like the corners of my mind" 
 "I wanna stay with you, forever" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge 
 In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral 
 My respect for all men is mutual 
 As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to 
 You've been given the chance to hear the true and living 
 So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom 
 So you can understand, how the thunder and 
 Lightning above your head is caused by the Son of Man 
 We experimentin' with high explosions 
 That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions 
 The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva 
 This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver 
 In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany 
 My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany 
 Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell 
 Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference 
 First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense 
 This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision 
 You can see it through the lies and the phantasm 
 Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual 
 Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies 
 To eradicate the wise 
 But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies 
 Of the heavenly celestial sphere 
 Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 A day to God is a thousand years 
 Men walk around with a thousand fears 
 The true joy of love bring a thousand tears 
 In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares 
  
 "I wanna stay with you forever"[Intro: RZA, Daddy-O] 
 Yeah, you know what I mean? 
 Cause yo, this right here this is called Knowledge of Self 
 When you apply that to yourself, you know yourself 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Yo; it's gonna get your third eye open 
 You can see things for what they are 
 And not what they appear to be 
 When the God gave me the knowledge 
 And pass this information to me, it's just- 
 Whatever, the God right there 
 Yo Peace, Born Knowledge, Peace God 
 Peace what up Bobby? 
 Yo, yo, don't even call me Bobby no more, man 
 What I call you? 
 My name is Prince Rakeem, you know what I'm saying? 
 What's Today's Mathematics? 
 I see Today's Mathematics is being wisdom 
 Let me explain like this to you God, how I see it 
  
 [Hook: female singer sample] 
 Ever since my Birth (don't worry!) 
 I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!) 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken 
 By a brother attemptin' to open 
 The graves, of these mentally dead slaves 
 Who've been lost on a cross, for decades 
 And centuries, lookin' for the liberty 
 But receive nothin', but misery 
 And hard times, and things of that nature 
 By the devil in a genocide caper 
 Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep 
 But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep 
 Nine thousand miles away from home 
 Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone 
 We the people, supposed to be equal 
 But the men who wrote that, they was evil 
 Slave owners, who did not include us 
 They just used us, and abused us 
 First they trick you, then mentally kill you 
 And use technologies, to rebuild you 
 This whole plan was a perfect scam 
 See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man 
 Six is the limitation of the Devil 
 In the Million square miles of land that he settles 
 Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot 
 Chemicals in your head to make you look cute 
 They use you as a fool to deceive your own people 
 And fillin' my children head with pins and needles 
 But I'll take out the pins you inserted 
 And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered 
 And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery 
 To speak the truth it takes bravery 
 And no man could stop my flow 
 Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 What, becomes of a broken family? 
 Dreams are crushed and there's no more family 
  
 [Hook 2X with RZA] 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second 
 Seen through Panavision 
 The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism 
 A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious 
 Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors 
 Who smite with the mighty right hand of God 
 Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod 
 Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma 
 Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona 
 And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive 
 As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive 
 Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner 
 With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer 
 And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill 
 Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still 
 Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible 
 Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title? 
 Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital 
 Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals? 
 Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head 
 Still puzzled like the jigsaw

 Wind, wind, wind 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Stronger then the locomotive, duffel bags of explosive 
 Make a savage disappear, like it's magic, hocus pocus 
 Auto focus memory, like the Canon 7D 
 Sharing heaven with my brethren, laying up with seventy 
 Persian virgins made for splurging, for deserving worthiest 
 Swerving on the merging traffic, boy, I'm impervious 
 The flack attack cat, on crack-a-lack 
 And Real Steel, like Hugh Jackman, black man with two mac tens 
 And two white bitches who's computer hacking, when they menstruate, great 
 They take it through the back end 
 You got your advance, but I doubt you got your back end 
 They thought I was out, but they brought me back in 
 I'm sick like Colombiana, only dick, understands that 
 Keep a nickel plated hammer, bammer blast, bark fast 
 Faster than a camera, grenades and a canister 
 They fading these amateurs, Hip Hop, God body 
 Superman stamina, you better come clean like Jeru the Damaja 
 Who's your hype man, is he also your manager? 
 When you get sprayed, does he get paid to bandage ya? 
 Kid, I will vanish ya, you I know will challenge ya 
 The God will banish ya, to land far beyond our star spangled banner's up 
 Better get your manners up, you was just a fan of us 
 And you could never fuck with the Wu-Tang Clan and us 
  
 [Verse 2: Zombie Juice] 
 Dead walk and leaving foes in coffins 
 No man alive can bare the shit that I walked in 
 A brass instrument, vibration from the Iron Fist 
 Blood drip like rain, pouring amongst men 
 Walk with God, swing the, sword of a marksmen 
 Penetrate the seeds, exterminate and defeat 
 I'm obsolete and you plead, fear the hate I bring 
 Cremate like the steam of a kettle 
 Inhale the breath of the devil, inevitable what we bring 
 The pleasure, and the pain, the measures in the game 
 Infecting the world with methods, the chosen unrespected 
 The martyr, bomb the entire army of liars 
 Settle down, took it down, bring it down, just a notch 
 My pride over standing, your soul I'm demanding 
 Your heart filled with fear, I see it in your eyes 
 Zombie gang nigga, on the rise 
  
 [Verse 3: Meechy Darko] 
 Darkness, darkness, all I see is darkness 
 Flesh made of bronze, although I bleed I am heartless 
 Impenetrable, fucking, unbreakable 
 Leave you fake, the humble, overcoming, this is incapable 
 Cuz pain, is what I cater to, in war there are casualties 
 And I bring death to anyone from the free to the shackled feet 
 We rape and pillage, leave your town in ruins 
 I don't understand your tears, hate to me is an illusion 
 And so is fear as well, my reign will reach through different realms 
 And we feared in hell 
 Blood from the foes soak my tattered clothes 
 Beneath my toes lies the mountain pile of those 
 Who chose to go against the most, unstoppable foes 
 Thinking you can stop the unstoppable, think you just froze 
 I'm the light, I'm the dark, I'm the right, I'm the wrong 
 Man of Bronze, meets the Iron Arm 
 Premonition while I'm writing scriptures on the Iron Horse

 When I was small 
 We had nothing at all 
 We used to eat Grits, for dinner 
 It was pain 
 Almost drive a man insane 
 What we could find for 
 To survive another day 
 But I said nah... 
  
 [RZA] 
 An old killa bee once hummed me a tune 
 Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon 
 Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room 
 Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon 
 Old Earth in the kitchen, yell "it's time to eat" 
 Across the floor, you hear a dozen stampeding feet 
 One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine 
 A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin' 
 Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy 
 Used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby 
 Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes 
 Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it 
 House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin' 
 Pilgrim on the box on the stove in the kitchen

 Young shorties in my hood started hustlin' 
 Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate 
 Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit 
 I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit 
 You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand 
 Drinkin, thinkin' of a masterplan 
 Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got 
 So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock 
 And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin' 
 MorningStar veggie bacon go good with the grits 
 Now let's take it back for real 
 When we used to build at ghetto big wheels 
 With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on 
 Girls skippin' rope in the street 
 The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet 
 Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps 
 Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat

 About me and you, tonight 
 If we could go do a little Rhumba 
 Dance, you just think about it and let me know

 Rhumba? What's Rhumba? 
 I'm sayin' though, what? 
 I'm sayin'.. 
 Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak 
 You the same dime piece that I saw last week 
 On the dancefloor, yo, the way you glide 
 Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide 
 Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink 
 Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync' 
 My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much 
 I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch 
 That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web 
 Not these everyday hoes sweatin' ghetto celebs 
 Power Rule, I heard you got the good Power-U 
 Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two

 Hey, hey, hey.. 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh.. 
 Eh eh eh eh eh.. 
 Hey, Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'? 
 It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True) 
 I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in 
 Your popi two-way beepin', let him know that you cheatin' 
 Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes 
 There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows 
 You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose 
 We can play doctor soon as I drop my Girbauds 
 I don't wanna dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike 
 Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice 
 I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night 
 Polite, I need a bag of that grass 
 To blast me out of sight like a satellite 
 Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you 
 Look at shorty ass shakin' like the system in my vehicle 
 Clubbin', twenty deep, buggin', all types of funny freaks 
 Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak

 Up in the club with the pistol 
 This chick bumped into me like, "You big joint official?" 
 Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo 
 She was like, "Yo, negro, negro" 
 Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so (so so) 
 So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, "I like that" 
 Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that 
 Flow and a half, blow at her back 
 I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back 
 She was like say her name 
 I was like, "Say mine back" 
 She was like, "Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy" 
 I love it like that, Beretta stay givin' it 
 Power-U so good, I just might have to jizz in it

 [Intro: RZA] 
 Digital... why... 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 You can't do me nothing, you won't succeed 
 You moving fast, reduce your speed 
 Weak producers, imitate my beat 
 When they face me, make 'em kiss my feet 
 You can't break me, you get deflected 
 Can't remake me, already perfected 
 Wu-Tang slang, to disrespect it 
 Your heart get pierced from hard darts ejected 
  
 [RZA] 
 I walk wit a pocket computer, out talk the prosecutor 
 Slipped through these metal detectors with plastic German lugers 
 With all rubber bullets, my dogs, they love to pull it 
 Stay black hooded, dunn, Timberland footed 
 Deadly dialect, Digitech, I'm six steps ahead 
 Spread like plague, plus I wire taped the feds 
 Brain wave manipulation, radios in my head 
 Sip Colloidal silver, immune cells get fed 
 Deflecting viruses, I'm overcoming biases 
 True lion of Judah, bout to reclaim the lioness 
 Devil expiration date, time to set the nation straight 
 You should pay attention to the words I articulate 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Monk] 
 Goodie goodie, I walk it out in the hoodie 
 And let my shoulder lean, just some gangsta boogie... 
 You now rocking with the best, Compton's finest with finesse 
 By the dress code and approach, you can tell I bang the left 
 West Side of the coast, everybody's cutthroat 
 Bitches love to start shit, they also love to deep throat 
 Three wheel and hundred spokes, while I'm blowing chronic smoke 
 Turning corner after corner, with my Southern Cal folk 
 But the underground in the city life, it ain't a playground 
 I'm loyal, dedicated, always ready to throw down 
 My morals, and my values, retire up on the richter 
 Speak this vivid, so you clearly get the picture 
 And description of a real one, standing in your mist 
 I don't just talk, I walk this Killa Cal shit 
 Footprints of a legend as a I paint the concrete 
 King of the jungle, still no one can compete 
 With my entourage, call ya squad, I checkmate 'em with a pawn 
 Seven moves ahead to off your head, it won't take that long 
  
 [Hook][RZA] 
 A man with no friends, only live for revenge 
 Live his life off the henge, cut, through a thousand men 
 Blade swing with the force of a cyclone 
 Cut crystal and bone, pistol and chrome 
 Stand in my path, you're a dead man 
 I cut the whole world in half for the Number One headband 
 Quest of a lonely soul, on a lonely road[Produced by RZA] 
  
 [Intro: RZA] 
 Yo, where the beat, where the buzzin' at? 
 It took ten-thousand years to find you 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 It's the unspoken word, you not heard, get your brains open 
 Controlled emotions freewill as the same token 
 Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal 
 We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Word's on the street Dunn Dunn Bobby's going Digital 
 Hovering the city inside the Wonder Woman's invisible jet 
 Clouded by the Meth we move undetected 
 In secret society sects, NARC's radar 
 Suspected us to be a cumulus cloud, ejecting lightning 
 Striking like a wild knuckle fight, in New Brighton 
 A million strands of spider webs weaved to make my vest 
 Chi energy compacted deep within my inner chest 
 One touch of my eagle claw clutch rips your guts 
 Brass head kill you fast with a rapid head bust 
 Ninjas spying, the ammo flying, the steel iron 
 Blow a nigga neck from his head like dandelions 
 My team is a magazine of M-16's 
 But we calmly defeat your army by blowing steam 
 Noisy as a thousand barkin dogs, rap's sweat hogs 
 Welcome back to the catalogue, Hip-Hop cyborg 
 Bobby Digital, keyboard clogged bitch you analog 
 We blowin smoke creating Scooby Doo fogs 
 Escape cell block eight's my tape on the rocks 
 Sean Connery, calmly bombin MC's, who stuck on my phenomenon 
  
 [Bridge: RZA] 
 Word up, no hurry up, for the merrier 
 You worry Duck, you get touched by the razor cut 
 You feel the flurry huh, don't worry yo 
 You get cut by the razor, yo, yo, yo yo 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 The Wu rag tied around your head like a doo rag 
 Carry large black guns in small school bags 
 Funeral date will be engraved on the wall in roman numerals 
 The Looney Tune niggas I be rollin with be screwin you 
 Quick to make a nigga shit in his pants with one glance 
 Laid back like a fat Huffy bike on the kickstands 
 My Clan'll make the most hardrock chump turn to glass and shatter 
 Leave no traces of your matter 
 You kids playin hot feet, wait til you go to sleep I pull your teeth 
 I'm vegetarian bitch, I don't need the beef 
 So how I spell relief? Ruler Z, Arm Leg Leg Arm Head 
 B.O.B.B.Y, you don't qualify 
 You don't have supply, it's a natural high 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 It's the unspoken word, you not heard, get your brains open 
 Controlled emotions freewill as the same token 
 Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal 
 We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two 
  
 [Bridge 2] 
 It's Bobby Digital, word you can't ridicule 
 We see a snake in the garden, we get rid of you 
 (Bobby you be on that bullshit) All the time 
 (With them big words and shit) I free y'all niggas minds 
 (What the fuck you think you are some king or something? 
 Motherfucker you ain't shit, high profilin) 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 Yo, yo, my enemies of the Killa Bee Clan's founds their peers 
 Buried for a thousand years, or drowned in tears 
 My unpredictable lyric script, is spine tingling 
 Like slime from a baby's mouth, bitch niggas you be lingerin 
 Bobby bobs panties from bitches with big asses 
 (Bobby you be bugging) Girl my mind flashes 
 My seeds be royal, niggas sweat muslim oil 
 My Earth gave birth to the fertile crescent soil 
 No time for fragile planet for small wombs 
 My dick bust a universe, my nuts weigh a moon, stay in tune 
 Champagne thoughts with Bud Light money, blunts dipped in honey 
 Digital, make the gloomiest day feel sunny 
 Slang slides slashes for him plan record upon the Lord 
 Confuse you like a forty-eight track mixboard 
 Milli phaser blast a hole in your back the size of moon craters 
 These anti-crucified on my Technic crossfader 
 Fuck the bloodshed, you be leakin your soul 
 Physical mental emotion we will control 
 Infinite darts I apply to your back like horse brandin 
 I clear a thousand men with a jaw of an assbone, black Samson 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 It's the unspoken word, you not heard, get your brains open 
 Controlled emotions freewill as the same token 
 Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal 
 We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two 
  
 [Bridge 3: RZA] 
 It's Bobby Digital, word you can't ridicule 
 See a snake in the garden, we get rid of you 
 Slimy savages, against the Digital 
 Fuck you Analog, the shit is critical 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 It's the unspoken word, you not heard, get your brains open 
 Controlled emotions freewill as the same token 
 Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal 
 We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two 
  
 [Bridge 4: RZA] 
 Bobby Digital, word you can't ridicule 
 See a snake in the garden, we get rid of you 
 You slimy savages, shit is gettin critical 
 Fuck you Analog niggas we be Digital

 Hit the bodega for a 40 ounce son, Garcia Vega 
 Two bags of chips, and one pack of Now & Laters 
 Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck 
 Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good fuck 
 Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet 
 Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net 
 With their clothes off, son when the gun goes off 
 I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off - 
 Your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off 
 Like Kunta, tryin to run with his chopped toes off 
 Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider 
 Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin long fire 
 Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin 
 Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin 
 The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted 
 Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it 
 So tense, bitch there's no defense 
 This four-four inch'll make you jump the fence 
 Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len english 
 Stumble off the cold four-oh of Olde English Wu brew 
 Two-two inside the shoe 
 No describin what this heat, in my jacket could do 
 I teach, seeds to read, never reach for the weed indeed 
 Bow down to the great Bob Digi Digi 
  
 (Bo-bby..) Yo, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Oh, no, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Oh, no, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Oh, no, it must be.. 
  
 I keep rice soaked in coconut milk mixed with tofu 
 Sit in the sun six hours then I charge up like Goku 
 Dragonball Z; imagine you're raggin me 
 That's like walkin through a Blood hood flaggin a C 
 Not, tryin to tell you how much weight we carry 
 It may get, every snake in the tri-state buried 
 Plus, Feds had one add, sayin I gun traffed 
 I sold twenty million records bitch; some laugh! 
 Fresh shafts of morning dew on Nancy Drew 
 Sherlock Holmes crime sleuth couldn't figure the Wu 
 You loaf of bread head, keep a sober head 
 One point five mill a year's my overhead 
  
 (Bo-bby..) Yo, yo, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Yo, yo, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Oh, no, it must be Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Yo, check, yo 
  
 I keep MC's puzzled keep my dogs in the muzzle 
 Ice cold forty ounce drink 'em down with one guzzle 
 Son might spit a word at a bird, see if she chirp back 
 Tall chocolate deluxe buttercup, off the meat rack 
 A chickenhead scratch the yard for worms 
 And roosters walk around with their heads in the perm 
 I be spreadin knowledge keepin my third eye polished 
 Never, chase for dollars to fulfill the black wallet 
 You must be Bellevue, son, I walk with twelve jewels 
 Afford anything this world could sell you 
 Beats that the change the style'll rearrange ya 
 BZA-Bobby! I'm strikin' you like Beatlemania 
  
 Yo, it must be Bobby 
 Oh, no, it must be Bobby 
 Yo, son, it must be Bobby 
 BZA-buh, BZA-wha', BZA-Bobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Fuckin' up the mic is still my hobby 
 (Bo-bby..) F-fuckin' up the mic is still my hobby 
 (Bo-bby..) Yo, yo, it must be.. doo doo! 
 (Bo-bby..) Yeah, yeah 
  
 (Bo-bby..) - {​*repeat to fade*}​[Sample] 
 The legendary number one headband 
 It's promise is power, omnipotence 
 Immortality, but at what cost? 
 One that is greater than any man can imagine 
 And heavier than any man can bare 
 No soul who has ever wore it's tattered grace 
 Has ever escaped the torment of it's infinite burden 
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
  
 [Intro: P. Dot w/ RZA laughing] 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (Afro!) 
  
 [Hook 2X: P. Dot (RZA)] 
 So many times I had sneak up on them quicker 
 With my finger on the trigger, like 
 Like I'm pulling out my sword 
 This is combat, man, this is war (Afro!) 
  
 [RZA] 
 Brain stained with the harbor, sword stained with the blood of martyrs 
 Revenge is a never ending story, Afro's the author 
 Trying to bother, the bare site of my father 
 So I'm living today, like there's tomorrow 
 Sword, inside my sheet, my heart is filled with beef 
 For all the dead souls, that I chopped into piece 
 Return, of the Afro sheen, fatal mean guillotine 
 Sword in my hand, I want the number one headband

 Ay, ay, ay 
 Ay, ay, ay

 [Outro: P. Dot] 
 Ay, ay, ayThis song, entitled "Destiny Bends" was written last night after hearing the tragic news of the loss of a good man named Paul Walker. I met Paul on the set of the film Brick Mansion, where we talked, laughed, and exchanged ideas of life and fatherhood. I only knew him personally for less than a year, but we knew each other through our work and art. We saw in each other a kindred spirit of men coming from unlikely circumstances, and rising to be the light and beacon of our family and loved ones. Men who learned the joy and pains of love in life, and success, while coming to realize that nothing is more important than family, friendship, and the brotherhood of humanity. Millions of people get to know an artist or movie star through their work, but few are allowed to cross each others' paths and see through the veil of stardom and find the common denominator that we share. As all physical things will decay and wither away, film, art, and music remain longer than the vessel that delivered them. In this vein, the one thing we can't take away or give back is time. So, thus, time is the most precious gift. I dedicated my time to compose this song with my two sons and new friend Will Wells, who was kind enough to sing and perform it for me. We dedicate it to Paul Walker. A good man. We had plans to continue working with each other in the future. It seemed destined, but "destiny bends". 
  
 *Note* This song is not for criticism, it's just a sketch demo. Please enjoy and reflect. 
  
 Your comrade in the struggle, 
 RZA*Intro: The RZA* 
 Yo, it's a samurai showdown 
 Samurai showdown... 
 (Aight, A.T.M.) How dare you challenge me? 
 You will die from the tip of my sword today 
 Huh, the trenches, we must remain calm 
 Right, prepare to die 
  
 ***Chorus: The RZA (x2)*** 
 Yo, it's born-born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born-born, young Lord, raise your swords 
  
 [The RZA] 
 Yo, yo 
 Hailin from the slums of Shaolin, golden claw, talon twirlin' 
 One swirl of the fatal sword splits your eyelid 
 Wu Killa Bees' stingers back on the swarm again 
 BZZZZZZ, the alarm again, six direction weapon deflectin 
 Bones connect like opposite sides of magnets 
 Steel fragments bein chipped off a slingin sword slash 
 With the force of big crash in your dash board with no airbag 
 He drove a ninety-nine Jaguar 
 Quick to pick a lock, lick a shot 
 Respect the Bloods and Crips a lot 
 Plus the God from Ride saggin in his seat, blastin Wu beats 
 Tryin to plot his next hit 
 He took a drag of the eight elements that composed, atmospheric gas 
 'Bout to let off his sword, and full blast 
 Kept his mind focused, meditation position half lotus 
 Abbot's sword novas couldn't match his magnum opus 
 Deluxe stroke, son move like a ghost 
 Struck in an instance, unnoticed like a lamp post 
 Radar sharp precision gunfire, explode 
 Till his clips unload, it's a samurai code 
  
 ***Chorus*** 
 It's born-born, young Lord, raise your swords (5X) 
 Time for everyone to go record 
 It's born-born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Time for everybody to go record 
  
 [The RZA] 
 Crept in silent, the steel wind 
 Chrome silencers screwed on tight kept the gunshots just sealed in 
 We attack, full fledge 
 With Chicago Bull red bandanas tied tight around our heads 
 Swing with the force of a sledge 
 Single-edge stainless steel blade chopped the wedge 
 Slit this analog derelicts head 
 Who even thought that 
 He could go against the truth and the Gods and fall back? 
 From the will of Allah, you'll be facin the firing squad 
 Of a thousand archers out to mark ya 
 The bill top scully king blocks bullets like jelly beans 
 Birds in my nest restin up, on the telly scene 
 Murderous rap track to me, is ego felony 
 Can't accept what you analog cats be tellin me 
 I get the verbal weapon, won't hesitate for one second 
 To break your back like Big Jack from Tekken 
  
 ***Chorus*** 
 It's born-born, young Lord so raise your swords 
 It's born-born, young Lord, raise your swords (2X) 
  
 [Instrumental for the next 1:17][Intro: 'Invincible Shaolin' sample] 
 The technique depends mainly on arm and finger strength 
 Once you've that 
 Then the next step is to learn how to pierce stone 
 Well you might as well start practicing now 
 Do you-Do you-Do you-Do you 
 Do you know, mantis legends? 
 How it was it all started? 
 It was fighting off this blackbird 
 Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size 
 It was a very valiant insect 
 And that's why the technique needs a brave man 
 And a strong one who isn't afraid of odds 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Welcome back to the temple of Hip Hop and Sword Kenpo 
 Lyrical rhyme nympho, b-boy Bob Digital 
 Diamond crystal ring, solid gold bone rituals 
 We be the humble, most calmest individuals 
 Hard to spot microdots, we Sasquatch 
 Stomp MCs, third eye Cyclops laser beam shots 
 Being fired once the father get raised up 
 We John Blaze up, abrasive heat from a phaser gun 
 Never left for a stun dunn, Atilla the Hun 
 Type Killa Park Hilla, eighteen wheeler 
 Macks in the truck lanes from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil 
 You red wolves be prowling 
 Howling over the shit that got the whole world bowing 
 We spoiled, one thousand swordsmen 
 One thousand recordings, one thousand Wu stores and 
 One thousand rap tours and global insurance 
 Not your everyday occurrence 
 My rhyme torments MCs with the fear of God 
 You'll be cursed like Farad and struck by the iron rod 
 Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-POW 
  
 [Chorus: Tekitha] (x2) 
 Hell's Wind Staff, the wrath of Black Titans 
 Niggas battling, sword swinging 
 Cut-throat women, whirlwind given, save the children 
 Escape the poverty for living 
 Let live, die by the mic, shadow skill by night 
  
 [Break: 'Invincible Shaolin' sample] 
 Man-Mantis style isn't easy to learn 
 A mantis is small but powerful 
 With it's arms it can lift up many times it's own weight 
  
 [Verse 2: Masta Killa] 
 On behalf of the Wu-Tang Clan I'll display the Hong Kong 
 Shaolin King Kong poems 
 Slaps niggas in half from Kwangtung 
 Ten Tigers scratch like Allah Math, the Hell's Wind Staff 
 Watch the Eight Diagram strike the diaphragm 
 Pierced lung minute funk tongue double-edged, sound the drum 
 Here I come as predicted 
 Holding the raw seal, all heads kneel 
 7th Degree black mic skill is ill, listen to the guns holler 
 Swallow the shell, East New York terrorist 
 Break fool to this, madness, crazy low-hand 
 Grabs the mic stand, smooth as water 
 Spat Seven Seas you've not yet mastered 
 Breathe and lungs wheeze, Earth kills 
 I'm wrecking MCs, blood spills, meadow, is round 
 The piercing sound of silence deafens ears 
 Fires fears, wood sharp eagle claw tears 
 Tree from bark, hard to maintain control 
 When you leaking, I stand with the strength of Jobe 
 And hold pressure that'll bust your head, while I'm teaching 
 Civilization, one having Knowledge 
 Wisdom Understanding, culture refinement 
 Not a savage in pursuit of happiness 
 Thunderous Mantis, all chant this[Intro: RZA] 
 Protect your girl from Bobby Digital 
  
 [Hook: Force MD's] (x3) 
 Sometimes! I find! 
 Someone, fuckin with my pussy 
 My money and my ride 
 Tuck my nine inside my hoodie 
  
 Sometimes! I find! 
  
 [Chorus: Ms. Roxy] 
 Catch me if you can Lovin' 
 Rocks laced in a band 
 Nothin', compares where my niggas from 
 Ride shotgunin' , Bobby keep the love comin' 
 I'm sittin pretty and my lovin is Digi 
  
 [Verse 1: Bobby Digital] 
 Fresh dipped out my laboratory 
 Just dropped down bout 40 stories 
 Hit the ground, you analog cats ain't got nothin for me 
 Red and blue mismatched shoe, Havana Joe Wu-Wear bandana 
 Play you Vegas type hoes silly, like Dan Tanna 
 Bubble Hilfiger Goose, gold rope thick as hangman noose 
 She had the honey blonde hair mixed, with the chocolate mousse 
 Butterfly tattoo, Boo, let me holla at you 
 And I'll change that tattoo to a Wu-Tang tattoo 
 New York City ditty bop type slang, girl let's smoke a blantz 
 Hit the Jack Danz, and after that we could dance 
 With the Black Widow, gold Benz with the chrome griddle 
 Fat juicy lips, ebony let me taste your spittle 
  
 Chorus (except last line) 
  
 [Bobby Digital] 
 Hair wrapped like Angela Bassett for Malcolm X 
 Ice cold golden texts, cassette of Inspectah Deck 
 Uncontrolled substance, earring inside her belly button 
 And one inside her Power-U she said she use for nuttin 
 SCREAM ON IT, Bobby the black Green Hornet 
 Girl DREAM ON IT, I put the Killa Bee sting on it 
 Rejuvenated, honey kept her throat lubricated 
 Let off so much Chi, ginseng couldn't recuperate it 
 Back scratchin, eyes squintin, Dusk to Dawn 
 Quentin Tarantino type porn, like Lewinsky-Bill Clinton 
 Suck it down with no commercial 
 Good Power Universal Self Savior Why 
 B.O.B.B.Y.! 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Bobby Digital] 
 Girl SCREAM ON IT, Bobby the black Green Hornet 
 C'mon DREAM ON IT, the Killa Bee sting on it 
 Screw the top off the boilin pot, girl you must be boilin hot 
 Sit on my unfalling cock, let me strike your G spot 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Bobby Digital] 
 Yo, kept a nigga well-fed, put seven braids in my head 
 Pillow soft as cobweb, Egyptian cotton bedspread 
 Lyin deep between the legs, I mix the sperm with the eggs 
 Bust off about a keg, she called it creamy nutmeg 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Bobby Digital] 
 Throw on my high beams 
 Her breasts was like two scoops of ice cream 
 I scream, you scream, we all want, ice cream 
 Bone until she fall asleep, she can have a nice dream 
 I scream, you scream, we all want the ice cream 
  
 Chorus + "and my lovin is Digi.. 
 And my lovin is Digi.. 
 And my lovin, and my lovin 
 And my lovin is Digi" 
  
 Down-town![Intro: Method Man] 
 Ain't what you want baby 
 It's what you need baby 
 Ain't what you want baby 
 It's what you neeeeeeeed 
  
 [Verse One: RZA] 
 Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles 
 Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical 
 Insulated thermal Wallabees drain they co four butt solos 
 Photographic prototype static-free motivated soldier 
 Or Wu say boulder head flower 
 You can detect the true and living God from his aura 
 Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight 
 But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate 
 And drunk grape concentrate, with sodium benzoate 
 Fried the chicken thighs in triglycerides 
 And his bitch advertised her breast size 
 Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes 
 Then he became highly civilized 
 And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance 
 And stopped wearing Benetton 
 Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne 
 Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted 
 Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted 
 Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers 
 Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others 
 For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear 
  
 [Chorus: Method Man] 
 Ain't what you want baby 
 It's what you need baby 
 Ain't what you waaaaaant 
  
 [Verse Two: Cappadonna] 
 Pelle Pelle had the top dresser 
 One man catalog the London Fog casual hog 
 Bear denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king 
 Everyday, DLO jacket equipped with the drawstring 
 Fila supply big daddy Starter hat, The brown-skin derby match the Tommy Hill; Advil 
 Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck 
 Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine 
 In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's 
 The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn 
 Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cappa fleece wear 
 One wear plaza, Donna hold the best of all year 
 Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on 
 We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear 
  
 [Verse Three: Method Man] 
 Ain't what you want baby

 Satisfaction guaranteed baby 
 Just hold your own baby 
 And just rock on baby 
 I got this wine on my mind 
 Feelin fine darlin 
 Now all you see baby

 [Intro: Raekwon] 
 It's phat, man, it's phat, man 
  
 [RZA] 
 I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shining 
 My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds 
 That be twinkling, while my love be sprinkling 
 We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinkling 
 Allah's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious 
 Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless 
 Embraces all races, all caste and all cases 
 In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces 
  
 The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions 
 Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection 
 Who gives you all and never ask more of you 
 The faithful companion that fights every war with you 
 Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical 
 He's the all and all, you searching for the oracle 
 A mission impossible, purely philosophical 
 But you call him on your death bed when you laying in the hospital 
  
 And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil 
 Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil 
 Building a home for themselves and storing food 
 At night we praise Allah and adore the moon 
 In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child 
 Only fearing God, we great a ghost with a smile 
 That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh 
 Meaning life has no partnership with death 
  
 Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us 
 They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce 
 Mentally dead, essentially led 
 By the false teachings, and eventually pledge 
 Their allegiance, to that which was against them 
 And exempt them from the truth 
 Then juiced them and pimped them 
 To give it in tithes, so the church can rise 
 While their babies home hungry covered with flies 
 Bzzzz, trying to harness the wind 
 Allah's the father from without and within 
 On Christ return, who will announce him? 
 Every tree is numbered, but who can count them? 
 The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them? 
 Allah's the father of all, why do you doubt him? 
  
 [Sample] 
 The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts 
 The fists are the arrow, the body is the bow 
 All movements have to be natural 
 The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful 
 Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance 
 Avoid the enemy's strong points... 
 Eagle's Claw!Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me, a lot of things upset me, as my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of self physical.....listen, let me tell you about.. 
 Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me 
 A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of self physically enslaved 
 By the luxuries of this world so I behave 
 Like a man inside the grave 
 Who's life is lost 
 I want the promised gold but can't afford the cost 
 Or could I, I know the prescribed laws 
 Any effect is a result of the cause 
 Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied 
 Burning inside wanting to open wide 
 And scream 
 The name of the supreme 
 But I'm trapped in this world 
 Lusting for girls 
 Therefore I imagine a genie and a wish 
 And searching for things that just does not exist 
 But in the midst there's the answer for which I have searched 
 Cause from me springs divine prince rakeem 
 And that is me the master of equality 
 With the ability 
 To set myself free 
 But b.o.b.b.y 
 He don't want to die 
 He don't want to die he don't want to try 
 So I'm forced to cry 
 And get trapped up for living my life inside a lie 
 These problems surround me 
 A lot of things upset me 
 As my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of my self physically enslaved 
 By the luxuries of this world so I behave 
 Like a man inside the grave 
 Who's life is lost 
 I want the promised gold but I can't afford the cost 
 Or could I, I heard of the prescribed laws 
 Any effect is a result of the cause 
 Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied 
 Burning inside and wanting to open wide 
 And scream 
 The name of the supreme 
 But I'm trapped in this world 
 I'm lusting for girls 
 Before I imagined a genie and a wish 
 And I'm searching for things that does not exist 
 But in my midst there's the answer 
 For which I have searched 
 Cause from me springs the divine prince rakheem 
 And that is me the master of equality 
 Give myself the opportunity 
 And set free and be all I can be 
 Be all I can be 
 And not a nigga just trapped up in luxury 
  
 Yo bobby digitial got to get knowledge of his self right now 
 As we go through the struggle of life we got to go from boy to man 
 We start off as sperm to baby baby to man from man to dead man 
 And from dead man back to sand 
 All praises due to allah the most high word up 
 I got to be free I got to be free I got to break free 
 I got to break free I got to break free I got to break.....[Intro: RZA] 
 You know they say 
 In every man's life, there comes a time 
 When you get struck by the arrow of cupid 
 By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman 
 Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life 
 And it brings the storm, sing about it 
  
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 There was once a love in this 
 Love is more than just a kiss 
 Will we take you to that step 
 Will we do more than just connect 
 And will you, bring the thunder in my life 
 And the fire in my eyes 
 Cause then there, will be days of pleasure when 
 Everything far will be so near 
  
 [Hook: Xavier Naidoo (woman)] 
 I have never felt thunder (thunder) 
 And lighting (lightning) like this 
 I have never been struck by (struck by) 
 A wonder (a wonder) like this 
  
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 There aren't days where I can, stop talking about you 
 There aren't days I can't stop, saying your name 
 And I'm looking for ways in never, to part from you, ha-ha 
 And everything change and you, still stayed the same 
  
 [Hook 4X: Xavier Naidoo] 
 I've never seen, and there's never been 
 Anything, with the beauty of you 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 Aiyo, shorty, I've never met someone so beautiful 
 From your hair follicle to your finger nail cuticle 
 Struck by the arrow of cupid, this love is deep rooted 
 Like someone, took my heart sampled it and looped it 
 To a song that's endless, passion brings the tempest 
 I'll slay a thousand dragons to save my little princess 
 A walking gift from God, you are my shining star 
 The diamonds and gold that most men be mining for 
  
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 Days that we shared our light treasures 
 The treasure light fire is to mankind 
 My hands will try to carry you to heaven 
 But since I've seen you, you've brought heaven to my mind 
  
 [Hook 4X][RZA] 
 Niggas never grow up, some drink til they throw up 
 Some sniff that cocaine til they fucking brains blow up 
 Grass junkies, drunk on that Brass Monkey 
 Walk around wit the brain of a Crash Dummie 
 How the fuck you gonna try to gas cash from me? 
 You be in the House of a 1,000 Corpse like Rob Zombie 
 Culture this I God, all inside your iPod 
 Cuz my squad, nigga is die hard 
  
 [Hook 2X: Startel] 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's getting colder 
 Hood's like Iraq, and I'm just a soldier 
  
 [RZA] 
 Niggas creep, yo, check it, yo, yo 
 Welcome to the City of God, where it's gritty and hard 
 And these dogs walk around at least, fifty a squad 
 Saying give me a yard, trynna, split me a broad 
 Maybe, spit me a dart, so I could, get me a car 
 Niggas creep, half can't read or speak 
 Shoot the whole crib, buckwild like Little Zeke 
 From the slums, yeah, we be the blind, deaf and dumb 
 We got six year old sons, knowing how to use a gun 
 They would shoot and don't think about it, won't even blink about it 
 Go home, lay on momma breast, nigga, drink about it 
 So while you huff and you puff, like you rough and tough 
 Your ass turn to a bitch once you in the cuffs 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 Nobody understands me, not even my family 
 Most important man on the planet, still they ban me 
 Instead of giving praises and revealing a Grammy 
 They'd rather see me stressed out, concealing my jammy 
 Hoping I got smoked out and broke like Sammy 
 Spent the wheel of fortune then get struck wit a whammy 
 Never that, black, I got my act together 
 How can hip hop be dead when Wu-Tang is forever? 
  
 [Hook 2X][Intro: Angel Cake (RZA)] 
 C'mon Bobby, turn off that loud shit 
 Damn, I wanna hear some slow shit that's gonna relax you 
 (You know, a nigga, knahmsayin 
 Goin through all that shit in the streets n shit 
 The hip-hop shit, only shit keep a nigga mind in) 
 I hear you, but it's all about me and you right now 
 (Word) 
 Just take off your shirt 
 Cause I wanna massage your back and your shoulders 
 (My little Buttercup, yaknahmean? 
 You a Buttercup girl) 
 Oh is that right? 
 (Yeah) 
 Well, I got Love Jones for you 
 (Word, tell me about it) 
  
 [Hook: Angel Cake] 
 Love Jones, I got a Love Jones 
 I got a Love Jones 
 For you 
 Love Jones, I got a Love Jones 
 I got a Love Jones 
 For you 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Yo girl you shinin like a brand new spankin black Glock 
 Or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox 
 Exotic bird, special blend of selected fine herbs 
 Make me wanna kick my bitch to the curb 
 Shaped like a naked statue, but look sacred 
 Candy to a baby y'know, I'm ready to take it 
 She spread your wings like a peacock 
 Girl you be the bomb, and Bobby be shellshocked! 
 Behold as I shape and mold your formless globe 
 Into a perfect O, and breathe the breath of life into your nose 
 With the fragrance of a fresh pink rose 
 And stroll into your eyes, the windows to your soul 
 And choose the best part, the dark pupil I chose 
 Your heart was mutual, into the center I dove 
 Backstroke in your abyss like a fish 
 Countin every thought and dream and wish, that exists within six 
 She was filled with pleasures, of all measures 
 But never took the time to discover, her own sunken treasure 
 Unlock the jewelry box, knowledge rose to the top 
 The distilled back in the fine mists, that gave birth to the crops 
 And seas, that brought us together, for the better 
 We could never seperate so maintain your stormy weather 
 So maintain the stormy weather 
 Word up, and let's walk these dogs together Boo 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo, Power Equality, Allah C's Everything my Queen 
 Whattup Love, won't you just slide under my wings 
 So we can take flight, to the edge of the night 
 And like doves, we makin love above the bright moonlight 
 You know I fills you, so let my love pass and spill through 
 Your sexual vessels, that bless you then fills you 
 Up with knowledge and wisdom you understandin 
 That bring forth the power refines your whole planet 
 She couldn't maintain this heavy slang that I dropped upon her 
 She claimed it never rains, down in Southern California 
 Bein a black man is most prominant and all dominant 
 I couldn't wait to get her home so I could explore her dark continent 
 And put my fountain, between her hills and mountains 
 Impingin every square inch of her circumfrence I was countin 
 Twelve trillion, four hundred and seventy-eight billion 
 One hundred and eighteen million, four hundred thousand ways 
 To make children, by buildin 
 Detected a fine mist but couldn't resist, I told her 
 "You wanna travel inside my head and see if you could rise above six?" 
 Then tilt her at the axis then bent her at her equator 
 And stuck the dynamite deep inside the crater 
  
 [Hook][Chorus: Islord] 
 Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital 
 Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable 
 We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers 
 ...and justice for all 
 (So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas) 
  
 [Verse 1: Killa Sin] 
 We move on MCs mechanically, strike nerves like Ghost's verse on 'Can It Be' 
 Hard to touch retarded fucks playing with their fantasies 
 Respect this specialist black, testing this will get ya necklace jacked 
 And name scratched up off my guest list 
 Party freak, you the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to 
 You throw a cold screw but sober up when I'm approaching you 
 At the same time we posting two 
 Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do 
 The limelight snatched away from you because it's my night 
 Killarm blaze hot in the twilight, you better get ya lines right 
 Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right 
 With dust flows, robotic movement and blurry eyesights 
 What you want I already got and that control 
 I keep my head high, hand upon cock and pockets swollen 
 You folding, you faggot ass fuck 
  
 [Verse 2: Dom Pachino] 
 Yo, my words should never fail 
 Shootin' darts sharper than a carpenters nail 
 Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife 
 Blowin' smoke out my peace pipe 
 Ducking the snipe shot off the top of the White House 
 A cop pauses, war never does its many causes 
 My offense is my defense, extreme precautions 
 Moving cyphers, high velocities making you nauseous 
 Ya forcing it, terrorist extortionists aborting this 
 Space ship that's spacious face it, almost can taste it 
 Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix 
 The case is if not ya basic way to make shit 
 Embrace it, knowing some day you'll have to face it 
  
 [Chorus: Islord (9th Prince)] 
 Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital 
 Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable 
 We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers 
 ...and justice for all 
 (So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas) 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 Hard to grapple my razor sharp scalpel technique 
 Slaps you, invasion body snatch you, money grip 
 I smoke the honey dip blunts, cherry bomb very calm 
 Verse bursts like a shot from the Berry homes 
 You'd be most wise to pay close attention to Willie Lynch-in' 
 It's stupid to fuck with Bobby Steel's henchmen 
 I step into presidential credentials 
 It's evident, my potential be infinite 
 Deluxe magnetic flux invincible, Obi-Wan Kenobi 
 Sword record in Dolby, Alexis Colby broad try to control me 
 Pussy whip me like Toby 
 Fuck the local, I move global 
 Economical, give seeds promised fool 
 My info glow In the dark, Wu-Tang logo sparks your attention 
 Look listen observe, Killa Bee swerve 
 Slam like Dr. Julias Erv, still strike the vital nerve 
 Charter through the Magna Carta, trapped like Otis and Carter 
 Wild like a Shaolin child from Mariners Harbor 
 King I Divines, lost his shines 
 Head burst open like a bottle of Pine 
 Use penmanship when I write my script, blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless 
 Killa Hill syndrome, peace to Two Tone 
 You must know me to understand me 
 And once you do, you realize I'm you, everything I do 
 Honey bee from the bee hive, evergreen freeze dried 
 Leaf smoke, Killah Priest from the tribe of Levi 
 Spoke, thou shall not steal or blunt spill 
 The indestructible Bobby Steeles is here 
  
 [Verse 4: Method Man] 
 Yo, in the heat of the night 
 My 4-7-7 Mash on the mic 
 Killarmy and Trappa John M.D 
 Full metal jackets 'cause some gots to have it 
 Kill or be killed only time will reveal 
 I think by myself and I drink by myself from '98 until 
 Let me know its real son if its really real 
 Understandable, self explainable, caution 
 John Blaze flammable when under pressure, interchangeable and still 
 Coming down like precipitation as I reign undisputed 
 How Johnny do it? Dangerously 
 Whooping cough (cough, cough), chewing off 
 Stank pussy make my dick sore 
 Bottom line be this, high explosive 
 Not for the average Joseph, come and get some 
 Hold eight and keep one, up in the chamber 
 Blast with my middle finger 
 9 swordsmen attack like the Four Horsemen 
 See me dog walking, strictly ghettio slang talking 
 All up in these guts, often, these rap niggas 
 Official we slap niggas with mad charges 
 Dope shit regardless 
 We usually take another niggas garments, what? 
  
 [Verse 5: Islord] 
 Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98 
 Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce 
 Like top notch politicians who be politicking 
 Slam through and expand total construction across the planet 
 And micro chip software placed in the rear of ya ear 
 As I slid to next year 
 All y'all analog niggas fuck y'all we be digital, shit is critical 
 Like the hallways in my projects 
 Similar to the streets in Tibet 
 Fuck that, I ain't playing with a full deck son[Hook: Thea Van Seijen] 
 Oh whoa, these tears that I've had 
 They here, have no, word 
 Then roll, each time each pain 
 I fell insane 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Fury in my eyes, sword on my side 
 Escape death to become immortalized 
 Afro on my head, the black Samurai 
 Number One, I bring a whole nation alive 
 I'm the leader of the Clan, you can tell from the headband 
 Spirit of God, become one inside man 
 Except all challengers, leave 'em in bandages 
 Sword won't ceist til my enemy vanishes 
  
 [Hook II: Thea Van Seijen] 
 And so your tables have turned 
 Only now with you and I've burned 
 Were these sweet memories? 
 In the rain 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo, I'm the master of disaster, no one swing a sword faster 
 I warned you, there'll be tears after the laughter 
 Now I'm 30 years, after the rapture 
 War blood will be spilt, we start a new chapter 
 Fury in my eyes, sword on my side 
 Afro on my head, I'm a black Samurai 
 Number One, I bring my whole nation alive 
 Escape death, to become immortalized 
  
 [Hook: Thea Van Seijen] 
 Oh whoa, these tears that I've had 
 They here, have no, word 
 Then roll, each time each pain 
 I fell insane 
  
 [Hook II: Thea Van Seijen] 
 And so your tables have turned 
 Only now with you and I've burned 
 Were these sweet memories? 
 In the rain 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 Yo, yo, dogs out to chase these cats, in the jungle 
 Rats wanna snatch that cheese, in the jungle 
 Bears want honey from bees, in the jungle 
 Birds wanna nest in the trees, in the jungle 
 Squirrels try'nna catch a nut, in this jungle 
 Pigs wild around in the muds, in this jungle 
 Lions on the hunt for the beef, in these jungles 
 Hyena roll around thirty deep, in these jungles 
 Try'nna snatch ice from the penguins, while I'm stingling 
 I see shorty wop, she got those ill rings jingling 
 They jingling, baby, I heard Ringling 
 Barnum & Bailey was in this place, shit is crazy 
 What's a man to do in this jungle? 
 Live life on the humble, in the jungle 
 When hamsters come and try to snatch a crumb from you 
 What a man 'pose to do, in this jungle? 
 If you can talk to animals in this jungle 
 Would you allow the slouth to come amongst you 
 Would you break bread, or instead 
 Get the thirty-thirty scope and put one in your head 
 Put one in the head 
  
 [Hook II: Thea Van Seijen] 
 And so your tables have turned 
 Only now with you and I've burned 
 Were these sweet memories? 
 In the rain[Woman over vocoder]

 Yo.. who wanna play the hero? Your chances are slim 
 Less than zero, Shaolin laboratory friend 
 That's the shit though, came to satisfy but can't get no 
 Sound pasified from the get-go, Cuban neckties for you Kiko 
 Only carry mines for protection, the hoods like the Wild West I reckon 
 Hold up a second, lost my breathe and 
 Take it from the top Introducin'! (Mr. Method) 
 Runnin in your session 
 With nothin but my words as my weapon 
 And twenty-eight years of aggression 
 Do it for my people when I take it back 
 Like I'm repo-man, agent double-oh negro 
 Know who I am? No, I don't give a damn 
 Evil, flash a Crooked I like I'm Deebo 
 Gets down and dirty like your moms pots and pans 
 From a small town, drink ya down like Shazaam!

 36 Chambers, you're pu-tang man (Word) 
 Brothers with a mic make a true slang fan(Yeah)

 [Interlude - Jammie Sommers] 
 DJ, that music just turns me on 
  
 [Masta Killa] 
 The marvelous bone crushin assassin appears to be 
 Blind in glasses 
 Daredevil bang head with shovel 
 Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal 
 The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin 
 The book of instruction, fuckin with the Wu-Tang Production 
 Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach 
 Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point 
 Slendid, hand Swingin Sword recommended 
 Slice through the bone intended 
 Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection 
 Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar 
 Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea 
 Dead sea, Digi.. 
  
 [Streetlife] 
 Yo, yo.. yo.. 
 My mind keeps playin tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix 
 Digital mode, your flows is all wasted 
 You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it 
 Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic 
 I know you lust, so relax and be patient 
 As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it 
 Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it 
 Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it

 Born up in Kings County 
  
 [Hook 1 - Force MD's] 
 Digital, these niggas should be crazy 
 Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby 
 This how, this is my life.. 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, YO 
 A Brooklyn baby, I was born up in King's County 
 Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me 
 Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me 
 Now roam gat in Staten with Cream Team around me 
 They called me Bobby, Cousin Billy got the black Harley 
 Taught his son how to snipe cats like Lee Harvey 
 Oswald, all's well that ends well 
 My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well 
 I got the cherry Range, known for rockin' heavy chains 
 I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings 
 On the back of the A-train, my daydream 
 Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM? 
 From the Clan that taught you cats Cash Rules 
 I make slow grind tracks, you grab ass too 
 Give respect to the Prince when he pass through 
 Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe 
 Cousin Billy, known to strap the black uzi 
 Shoot you in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby 
 Live on TV where you see B-O-B-B-Y 
 D-I-G-I-T-A-L (A-L!), things ain't too well 
  
 [Hook 1] 
  
 [Hook 2 - Force MD's] 
 Digital, these niggas should be crazy 
 Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby 
 This is how I live my life.. 
  
 [Masta Killa] 
 Yeah.. 
 Peace Lafyetee, Stuyvessant, Malcolm X 
 Shot dice on green, we live from Pulaski y'all 
 It's Fred Glassy, zig-zag-zig through traffic 
 Get the herb, get the God, peace Ra' 
 What's the word on things? 
 Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds 
 In the background, layin' down 
 I'm spittin' what the people missin' 
 We extreme with the murder type theme 
 Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat 
 Big guns, down South we blaze 
 Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston 
 Wild Texan, no trespassin' 
 Long mics hit the dead arm 
 Planet Earth, home of Islam 
 Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn 
 Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spin techniques 
 We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi 
 Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here 
  
 [Hook - both to fade]

 Aiyo, I wanna dedicate this song right here to O-Ren Ishii 
 Half Chinese/Half Japane-see, Half American and yo 
 Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection 
 She got the sinister cat eyes and little freckles on her complexion 
 Chief of Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa 
 And she got Crazy 88 killers that'll slice right through ya 
 Quick to chop a head off then wipe the blood off 
 A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off 
 You got a minute to pray and a second to die 
 You can see the image of the devil reflectin' inside her eye 
 But since she was a little girl, yo, she never would cry 
 She seen so much tragedy, let me explain to you why 
 She grew up on the military base, where she had to face 
 The brutality of her mother and her father being erased 
 The blood drops from her tear drops, on her face you see the smear spots 
 She silently watched, as the shogun sliced through her dear pops 
 Through his thick skull, now she's vicious like a pitbull 
 And when it comes to hatred, and revenge she got a shit full 
  
 Yo... revenge is that fire that burns inside your soul 
  
 Aiyo, she been bustin' off kneecaps, son, since the age of eleven 
 But fuckin' the enemy to death, uggh, that was her favorite weapon 
 And the death you paid in hell, boy, it can't be paid in heaven 
 You better got down on your knees, son, and start prayin' to the reverend 
 Bon appetit, boy, revenge is so sweet 
 Especially when it's served on a cold dish, but she has no wish 
 But to cut your day short like the winter solstice 
 And a chance to receive a slight bit of mercy from her was hopeless 
 Oren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see 
 Half American, muaww, yeah, oh what a species[Ol' Dirty Bastard (RZA)] 
 Let me tell y'all all something motherfuckers 
 (Oh you complaining about that man?) 
 Yeah them motherfuckers belong to us 
 Straight up, tell all ya'll motherfucking hoes 
 Ya'll motherfuckers know what's the fucking time 
 You think we don't love you motherfuckers? 
 Run in to the motherfucking courts with all that bullshit motherfuka 
 I'm letting all ya'll motherfuckers know 
 I'm getting tired a that shit 
 You motherfucking triple breed motherfuckers 
 Bitches we love you motherfucka 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Bobby Digi, Bob Digital shit is critical 
 Laid the fuck up inside the hospital 
 It's a riddle of a sphinx bitch had me jinx wid hijinx 
 Cuban linx snatched from my neck 
 It was the sex 
 This 12 ounce bottle of Beck's had me drunk 
 One night laid up wit the Ol' Dirt and ten bags of skunk 
 Just met this ho last month 
 Lookin' like a Benz with a woofer in the trunk 
 I pushed up like a push-up stick 
 One hand up near my cheek the other hand was holdin' my dick 
 I said "Power equal.. Boo!" 
 Where's your people? I be Bobby D-I-G-I-tal 
 (Is that right?) Word, and exact 
 Girl you got a smile that a make a nigga heart crack 
 (For real?) Word, ya grill like a thousand dollar bill 
 Close your eyes count to three and click you heels 
 And we could end up at my place face to face 
 Butt-naked I'll invade your inner space 
 *Sniff* Straight up boo 
 Damn I can taste it! 
 One drop of sperm the God wouldn't waste it 
 Over the quilt 
 I rather put it inside you so your breast be filled with milk 
 And we could lay up 
 And I could squeeze until it tilts 
 My house built on stilts is bangin' like the Hilton 
 Look, now how you feelin' gimme some feeback boo cause I need that 
 (Look Bobby where's the beer and the weed at?) 
 What girl? shit I got more than a little 
 She set me up for the kiss of the black widow 
  
 [Verse 2: O.D.B] 
 You couldn't get a flick of the hype outfit 
 Cause the way that I'mma dress this style is mad wild 
 Enough to make a crowd of women scream Oww! 
 Whether at a party or just in bed 
 Or thoughts of Ason bitch keep that in your head 
 My beats are funky my rhymes is funky 
 Sometimes I say well motherfucka what's the recipe? 
 I don't know! I ask my mama, she don't know! 
 Go ask ya poppa.... 
 It's all about me in the place to be 
 Nigga you all that uhhh.... 
 Motherfucka that shit is jinxed it's mad 
 Motherfucking game and it's a God-damn shame 
 How many motherfuckas wanna know this name, Ason 
 Yo I LOCK ON pass the break! 
 Shake and motivate, stimulate 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 By this wiz that you dying to have in your clutch 
 Fall in love like a drug 
 Call out into her love flood 
 Fuckin' so much, dunn you'll only bust blood 
 Caught inside the scud-missle grip like tissue 
 Now I'm laid up inside the hospital 
 Bobby Digital's on critical 
 Cause the testicles is drained

 I got hoes, in codes, in different areas 
 Four ton whips that's sittin' on interiors 
 The bass shake in the club like it's earthquakin' 
 I cock arm, pass the bomb, like Troy Aikman (Aikman)

 Thrown to the dungeon, for your spongin'

 Shame on a Nigga, take it back to Dirty 
 Run, game on a nigga, I'll be back in thirty 
 Seconds, got the world's greatest record 
 And that money I'mma spend it like your greatest record 
 This Division, all the ladies respect it 
 Disrespect it and the eighty'll check it 
 It ain't hard to see how ya'll ignorin' the steel 
 Niggas that I clap, lookin' for me still

 Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone… 
  
 [Hook: Justin Nozuka] 
 Woke up this morning, hoping 
 It was all a nightmare, you’re gone 
 Tried to get out of my bed 
 I couldn’t find no reason, you’re gone 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again 
 You’re gone… 
  
 [RZA] 
 Man how I long, to see your physical form 
 When you left me, a part of my soul got torn 
 How could a body turn cold, that was once so warm 
 How could the spark of Allah, in your heart be gone 
 Who could replace the space, of Unique Ason 
 I know you’d rather I’d be strong, and not waste time to mourn 
 They say that life goes on 
 Especially when I see the face of your first born 
 When he’s rocking on stage with no shirt on 
 Or in the hotel lobby, getting those birds on 
 Through our seeds we could all reach eternity 
 Peace and blessings, have a safe journey 
 I had dreams of us laughing, drinking beer 
 Chasing girls, fill the world with our ideas 
 Then I wake up, and look up, and you’re not there 
 But in my third eye, I know that you’re still here 
 Because, through our seeds we all reach eternity 
 Peace and blessings, it’s just another journey 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Justin Nozuka] 
 Looked out the window and stared at the sun 
 I couldn’t see the light, I couldn’t see, oh lord, you’re gone 
 You’re gone 
  
 [Kobra Khan] 
 Aiyo, I can’t stop the thoughts coming out of my mind 
 In a broken place is where you’re eventually find 
 This pain, on both sides, can’t deny 
 Memories of you and I takes us back in time 
 Where we used to be together, no matter, the stormy weathers 
 I would ramble with, nothing could ever break us apart 
 And sometimes would get under the pressure, cause people jealous 
 But your memory would be here forever, kept in my heart 
 This is more than you’ll ever know, me and you inseparable 
 Never do we let it show, it’s so hot I’ll let you go 
 Thought it would last forever, guess I was wrong 
 And time goes by so fast, and now you’re gone 
  
 [Hook: Justin Nozuka] 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again 
 You’re gone… 
  
 [Justin Nozuka] 
 My blood pumps with anger and sorrow and liquor 
 Tell me how, can I live without you now that you’re gone? 
 You’re gone 
  
 [RZA] 
 Against all odds and against all squads 
 And against all evil trying to come against God 
 We stand with the iron rod, you wield the ?sword? 
 I use softness to conquer the heart 
 I’m Divine Prince Master Rakeem Allah 
 Earth bound, but my mind’s in the stars 
 Things are reborn, life always change form 
 Man must reform to make the heart calm 
 Drunkenness, leads to non-awakeness 
 Causing him, to look upon his father’s nakedness 
 When the truth is heard, there’s no forsakin it 
 That which is forbidden, we don’t partake in it 
  
 [Hook: Justin Nozuka] 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 It breaks my heart, cause I’ll never see you again 
 And my heart aches, cause I’ll never see you again 
 You’re gone…[Intro: "Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang" sample] 
 "Take the sword" 
 "The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword" 
 "Huh?" 
 "Heh, you Wu-Tang are never gonna win" 
 "My lord, don't be afraid of the Wu-Tang techniques" 
 "Pick up the sword!" 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, ayo; chumps are in trouble, boy, tongue pay double, boy 
 I'm trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy 
 I leave you ducks in a puddle, buried under tons of rubble 
 Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles 
 Hot lead from the cylinder, from my two-shot dillinger 
 Put that hot steel in ya, bigger not feeling ya 
 Bio hazard, to ya flesh and ya fabric 
 No need to scratch your hair, son, the clean to my static 
 Strange apparatus and gadgets, my bullets got magnets 
 Pop pop pop, we attract to that crab shit 
 Super superior stamina, there's a Clan of us 
 All of what bulldozers, hard hats and jack hammers 
 And leather Old Testament copies, I'll probably 
 Give you a out of body experience, then hide your body 
 So there's no return, so burn, baby, burn 
 My clique fucking sick, nigga, learn, baby, learn 
 I got Milwaukee chicks like Shirley and Laverne 
 They bite ya dick off, after swallowing your sperm 
 They slice ya fucking throat while you lay there and squirm 
 They related to the judge, so the case get adjourned 
 You chumps are in trouble, boy, I said tongue pays double, boy 
 I"m trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy 
 I put your head in a puddle, buried under tons of rubble 
 Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles 
 Frickles and fragles, nigga, you're too fragile 
 Motherfucker, my brain is on Scrabble! 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 Aiyo, back for this annual conference, confronted on 
 You wack MC's, it's duck season, the hunt is on 
 What B9 squeezing and game is locked, a run upon 
 Thinking that you were the shit, nah, that's once upon 
 I doubt my run while you sit, I bust my gun from the hip 
 Why even make you a song, and when you ain't worth a skit 
 My niggas kill for the sum, and the'll be cursed for the flick 
 Probably til midnight until, scheeming on pussy to split 
 And then we back like crack, nigga, take a swig of that 
 Twist a twenty sack of black, figure, oh he a good kid 
 Such a nice smile he had, oh one more state 
 Then I whip it on that, slip slipping in the grass 
 Sip sipping on the glass, now I'm dipping down the ave

 Sixteen and over to pack 
 A twelve year old kid got bucked 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 The sweet premium classic lay your ass flat as a mattress 
 Smack your head off the axis, the rhyme facious 
 Silencer on the tech-nine shot got your pillow wet 
 All your bitch say was the black silhouette 
 Of the dark ninja, Lion King of the jungle, Simba 
 Cut the roof to your family tree, timber 
 Me and Dr. Strange in the black reign smokin chimneys 
 Fat Cappadonna tape stuck inside my Benzi 
 The blue coats is comin, the red coats is comin 
 The fed coats is comin, the wet heads is comin 
 I heard Dirt was up in Rikers fuckin a female C.O 
 Wu-Tang keep it on the D-low 
 Third eye is a trillion million watt gigabyte 
 Insght like bright, can't find this on your website 
 Everglow superior to your inferior material 
 Verbal serial murder, givin you pussy cats venereal 
 Injections, lethal injections, ran from house 
 Left the dictionary, pictionary, the non-fictionary 
 Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, puzzle like jigsaw 
 Struggled for charisma, yo

 [Verse 2: Islord] 
 Aiyyo, rock head niggas who grab mics for the first time 
 Get fronted on majorly once the God slides in 
 On the scene, love-love in the place to be 
 All-American lyrics, the top choice 
 In this rap market from Now Y all the way to England 
 Cuz my click be jinglin under Wu-Tang Productions 
 That's quick to sell a million, then bounced on tour outta state 
 Rap fiends was trapped in cells like hot cakes 
 Faster than the rate of the Earth travel 
 Which one-hundred-thirty-seven and one third miles per a hour 
 And peace to the God Power for never fallin for nothin less 
 Than a hundred grands and rap with rubberbands placed in 
 Golden suitcases, slitted across the table 
 To walk the dogs in the nine-eight, the nine-eight 
  
 [Verse 3: 9th Prince] 
 Yo, I build with the great minds of Africa 
 RZA, Star Trek Voyager, Killah Hill side strangler 
 Captured you in inside thirty-six gas chambers 
 North American, Arabian, halftone dark Indian 
 9th Prince convinces his enemies to kill themselves 
 Like Dr. Kavorkian, travel like razor satellites 
 Prepared for battles, devils try to raid the castles 
 Got tackled by the rebels, the plate in my head is heavy metal 
 Lyrical chain reaction, deadly instruments, run for symantecs 
 The international civil war assassins 
 Geological, biochemical, camouflaged nuclear aropostles 
 Sounds posible, cuz regardless visual 
 English grammer, mental examiner 
 I shock the world like the death of Princess Diana 
 Reverse psychology on technology, accept no apologies 
 The penalty is to cut off your arms and feet 
 Poetry teachers are speechers seepin through the speakers 
 My fans will become die hard listeners, plus ear bleeders 
  
 [Interlude: RZA] 
 Fuck what you think 
 Fuck what you think 
 Fuck what you think 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Outro: RZA] 
 Word up, Fuck what you think 
 Word up, yoI was afraid as a child. I was afraid of everything. I was scared of water--I couldn't swim--I was scared of trucks on the turnpike, and mostly I was scared of ghosts. But at some point, I realized something. A ghost is something you create yourself--a man's mind makes it happen. If there were nobody on Earth, would a ghost still have a chance to spook somebody? No. You manifest ghosts through fear. 
      The words of Marcus Garvey resonated with me. He said, "Fear is a state of nervousness only fit for children. Men should not fear. The only thing man should fear is God. To fear anything other than God is to offend God." I carry that to this day: Enlightened men do not fear.[RZA] 
 Yo, yo, back on the track 
 Bound to make your neck snap 
 Like riding the Scream Machine with no seat strap 
 Bob, bitch, hot throb, bitch 
 Get on your job, bitch, suck my knob, bitch 
 And get the fuck out my face 
 I ain't got no time and I ain't got no space 
 I pop again until you're finished 
 I'm charged up like Popeye and two cans of spinach 
 Laid out in a beach in Venice 
 Bitches all up in my grill like the dentist 
 Talking "Bobby, when we're gon' party?" 
 Big ass hoes with the pussy hair notty 
 Smoke until the throat get groggy 
 Fucking all night til the mirror go foggy 
 Cute cat like Heathcliff, I speak with the speech 
 Three gift, ginseng keep the meat stiff 
 If you wanna take a sniff or a whiff, bitch 
 Bow down, get the fuck on your knees 
 And just don't squeeze my nuts too hard 
 I won't slap your butt too hard 
 But let me just fuck you hard 
 Hard, hard --- listen 
  
 [Hook: Free Murda] 
 Ma, stop acting like you so fly 
 When you know you a freak on the inside 
 Ma, stop acting like you so fly 
 See them rims, rotating on that G5 
 Ma, stop acting like you so fly 
 You a dime, fat ass and them thick thighs 
 Ma, stop acting like you so fly 
 I'm trynna do nice things for the whole night 
  
 [ShaCronz] 
 You can catch Crizzy with a bad freak 
 We got hoes that take care of us, my team's spoiled like bad meat 
 We rotten like bad teeth, roll with mad heat 
 TV's in the rearview, with armored glass seats 
 If I like your butt, means I like the cut 
 Weight on triple beams, bitch price is up 
 Fight the rush, on sight, we like to bust 
 Steel, hype as fuck, team nice as fuck, what? 
  
 [RZA] 
 I bring catarack on forty feet back 
 And I bang rap beats over 43 tracks 
 Wu-Wear fleece and a Gucci lenin 
 Get drunk with the cops, fucking police women 
 Playing poker with the squadron sergeant 
 Get free food and clothes, muthafuck the bargain 
 The black ghetto prince, leave no metal print 
 Get put through the hood on the back of an elephant 
 Police escort, gat in the JanSport 
 Napsack, plus I just left court 
 And I was late for that court date 
 Because I was up all night fucking Strawberry Shortcake 
 Bad Power Rule from out of Pelon 
 Who had the pink & blue panties, do like the neon 
 Lights, the free on ice, the ebon' life 
 Clothes drop like one blow from the Leon fight, listen

 I'm trynna do nice things for the whole night[RZA] 
 The grand ultimate supreme, no extremedies 
 We use Tai Chi to deflect off our enemy 
 Five poisons, from the Clan there's no Remedy 
 We dispell the smell of wickedness in our vicinity 
 Bobby, the atomic, Islamic, bomb-droppin' 
 Appear in your atmosphere like the comet 
 Heading to the Western Hemisphere, non-stoppin' 
 Strikin' the belly of the sea to make it vomit 
 Things of beings is unseen by men 
 In shapes and form, never been dreamed by men 
 The word of God, always intervene with sin 
 From insight, my inner-light beams within 
 Pin-point focus, move silently un-noticed 
 When you attack, I fall back in the wind like the lotus 
 Put the soul in the track like my name was Otis 
 Pain in my heart and your chance is hopeless 
 For you to win, a change is gonna come 
 You heare the "suuuu"?, Wu-Tang is gonna come 
 And my vocals, they gonna bang on the drum 
 You go against the grain you will hang from ya tongue 
 So..

 To my soundwave there's no sonic solution 
 No Pro Tools to edit or out-date my producin' 
 Form like crystals, mushrooms after the missile 
 We strike into the hip-hop bone, of the gristle 
 And my thoughts be the marrow, son I'm the narrow 
 Tube inside the gun that's released through the barrel 
 And the words travel in lead, expandin' high-speeds 
 With the hole in ya head, and filled up you 
 With the, knowledge of self 
 I dropped out of school, I went to the college of self 
 And I pertained my wealth, B-O-B-B, when y'all niggas see me 
 I'm like Godzilla stompin' over Mount Fiji 
 Or Rodan with the wingspan, Prince Rakeem can 
 Rocks to the solo or combine with my team and

 Bitch, jumpin' out ya speaker 
 Huntin' for yo' egg like it's Easter 
 Although I come in peace, I would just like to say peace to 
 Scallywags, skeezers, and I don't really need ya 
 You don't understand why I don't understand either 
 Now shit's gettin' deep, you should've thought a lot deeper 
 It's my time to get over and I got on my blinker 
 So I write and I spit on the mic, so you can feel 
 What is truth, what is right and what's not 
 Yo I must kill the ideal and enlight this Earth 
 And yo I will give birth to a light that lives to keep it real 
 All through research, I learned in schools, not even Church 
 Can enstill, these words are jewels so you can heal 
 Still I search, and I works real hard, I need a deal 
 And with speed 'cuz it hurts indeed 
 Yo can you feel? my heart still pumps the blood that makes me bleed 
 All real and the pastor's best and I always will, do my thing

 Shabobalee, shabizzy.. 
  
 [Hook 2X: Thea] 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm, and hold you tight 
  
 [RZA] 
 Your dynamite antics, drove me to your magic 
 Merrily down the stream, you got me going frantic 
 Enchanted by your kiss, the apple's gigantic 
 In your Atlantic abyss, I'mma sink my Titanic 
 Granted your wish can be captured on candid camera 
 Oh shit, I got to pamper you 
 With this hand-trick gambit, open handed 
 Edible panties, no need for the hamper 
 We can spread out on the floor like Pampers 
 Chanting Karma Sutra, you got me speaking Spanglish 
 Mamacita, fuck semantics 
 God damn it, you understand it? 
 I'm about to blow like somebody pushed the panic 
 You fever the gene that Yacub sub-planted 
 Shape and mold ya body just like ceramics 
 Big valley rodeo style, above to stand with 
 Dream, dream, cream, cream 
 Legs open, I'm in between 
 You quench and scream, I split your gene 
 My chi, my yi, my shit, my jig 
 My lee, my con, crown me Kong King 
 Bottles of Ginseng, Jamaican ting 
 Wood root, it's the ultra sheen 
 Your flower being blossomed, pollinate like Spring 
  
 [Hook 2X] 
  
 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 Love, love, love is in the air, fireplaces, winter time 
 Bottles of wine, cuddled up with a friend of mine 
 She a dime, and in her physical prime 
 So every time we grind, she get a chill up her spine 
 Sign is Virgo, she from Chicago 
 She like my slow flow, and like my turbo 
 I'm like yo, we can burn the herbal 
 I got the purple, and you in my circle 
 By them hips I can tell she fertile 
 So I'mma take my time and as slow as a turtle 
 And I like her verbals, that wine she gurgle, got her acting terrible 
 And that ass is durable, had her bent over in the Bentley convertible 
 The girl was beautiful, my flow was surgical, and now I'm preferable 
  
 [Hook 2X] 
  
 [Hook: Thea] 
 When tonight chime, I taste your kiss 
 I make a wish, for you 
 When tonight chime, I feel your kiss 
 I make your dreams come true 
  
 [Crisis] 
 She was gorgeous, wit an ass that make you cum fast like Porsches 
 Face look like a portrait, body like a fortune 
 Mills in small bills, and tar heels, flexing sex appeal 
 Got my mind pondering, wandering how the sex would feel 
 First to kill she'd be an assassin, main part of her attraction 
 Was a chance to fast, stopped her and asked her name 
 Compliment of the elegance, she blushed, respond with intelligence 
 Her scent was heaven sent 
 Offered me a drink, beautiful with dead presidents 
 A few drinks later, we back at her residence 
 Surprised, in 35, I was deep between her thighs 
 When she came, she cried, looked me deep in my eyes and said 
  
 [Hook][Intro: RZA] 
 One-two, one-two 
 Mic check, one-two, one-two (You don't know, that I really love you) 
 Yo, yo, You'll Never Know 
 Check me out (You don't know, that I really love you) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
  
 [RZA] 
 I love you like how birds love rose petals, Killarmy love full metal 
 I love you like how the Park Hill cats love to pull metal 
 The heat will make ya head whistle loud like a full kettle 
 I come like the Meccan civilizin ya Roman Greco 
 Chicago Bull bandana, I keep police scanners from fishes 
 That try to splash me out like Daryl Hannah 
 And blow my spot, no, I'm not the polka-dot 
 I tote weight, sip Scotch, bust shots, smoke a lot 
 My cousin Billy, yeah dun is silly, used to joke a lot 
 Chased bitches, cut class, got high and stayed broke a lot 
 So when the rent was due, D would grab the identical 
 Twin gats and put a fuckin hole in your right ventricle 
 Not sober yet, don't pose a threat, yo I hold a Tec 
 Soda jet pack on my back blast like Boba Fett 
 While you bickerin, this flame is still flickerin 
 And the magnetic attraction to my wisdom keeps you listenin 
  
 [Interlude: Cilvaringz] 
 Yo, yo 
 Choco bang that shit! 
 Yeah, yeah (You don't know, that I really love you) 
 Killa Beez, European 
 Yo, yo, shut up! 
  
 [Cilvaringz] 
 Eh-yo, my sword so sharp I split the tweeters in ya Genelacs 
 European Killa Beez attack, chk-chk-chk 
 I never smoked blunts, tote weight, nor bust shots 
 But fuck with me I guarantee you'll get ya neck chopped 
 Be the haunting, dauntin, brothers won't fuck 
 With The Wu-Tang swordsman, slowly get dropped 
 When my Shaolin sword, swing at Nasty Immigrants with passports 
 To teach Man, Woman and Child, with the sword style 
 God, complete the presence 
 It only takes seconds to chop a nigga head on RZA records 
 But you a worthless effort, follow faster then leopards 
 I can't wait to return to the fuckin essence 
 Of hip-hop, yo, my shit chop constantly 
 It's over when my shit drops, son, honestly 
 I love the RZA and the whole Wu Academy 
 For givin me a chance to be what I wanna be (What?) 
 But you will never know how much... (I love the gods) 
  
 [RZA] 
 Do you think this cocked mic will jam or choke? 
 Come on my nigga.. Listen yo.. 
 Do you think this black mic will cock back, jam or choke? 
 I should stick a long silver hook down your throat 
 And snatch out your vocals, bitch my eyes is black opal 
 Reflectin this 2.2 kilogram Mac that smoke you 
 Fire ignitin' Northern Lights stuffed tight in chocolate Philly 
 Lyrics pierce through the ear like the spear of Achilles 
 Iron body Bobby Digital suit, don't bother to shoot 
 Quicker than Clint when I draw the six shoo' 
 Mortal Kombat whether it's the blind or the mute 
 Cripple, or idiot, dun, the style's ridiculous 
 Rapid flow got you petro, my voice echo, echoes 
 Off the Wall Street money we stash like Gordon Gekko 
 Gecko, gecko, let go my Eggo or feel my Eagle 
 4,5,6 in my hand, I hold the c-lo 
 Whether knocking out pounds, ounces or straight kilos 
 You know how we roll, it's a Killa Bee show 
 And I love you like the pharoah loved Joseph, the Jews love Moses 
 Like a man bendin down on one knee before he proposes 
 Expressed in the faith of Abraham about to slay Isaac 
 And the patience of Daniel in the lion's den with closed eyelids 
 You'll never know, you'll never know...

 Hip hoppers 
 Get your microphones ready 
 Coming all the way from the Windy City of Chicago 
 Bringing you a cold flow, like tons of snow 
 Introducing Rockie Fresh 
  
 [Verse 1: Rockie Fresh] 
 OK I wanna be the greatest of all time 
 Looking at the stars and I feel we can all shine 
 Looking at my dreams and I feel like they all mine 
 Seen a little pain but I'ma be just fine 
 I came from the dark I saw the light created a spark 
 It's a movie I'm just playing my part 
 And it's all in my heart and everyday it beats I be making moves 
 Even when I'm on feet I'ma make it through 
  
 [Scratch Hook](x4) 
 Beats I be making moves 
 Beats I be making moves 
  
 [Verse 2: Rockie Fresh] 
 Riding through my city and it's priceless 
 Top peeled back and the weather is the nicest 
 Working too hard is probably one of my vices 
 But it's gotta be done, games gotta get won 
 And right now I'm not too concerned 'bout where you from 
 But where you tryna go? Let a brother know 
 See you could plant a seed, water it and watch it grow 
 I'm just tryna go places I ain't never been before 
 He's so calm, he's so chill 
 The flow so mean but he nice for real 
 I'm just running to my momma just to pay those bills 
 And the team gotta eat so we all need meals 
 My cup runneth over and they want that spill 
 I always saw the plan before I saw that deal 
 Stay focused and soon they'll notice 
 The case still closed but this letter was open, we rolling 
  
 [Hook] 
 No matter how the wind blows 
 We gotta keep a cold flow 
 Double O's to the [?] 
 Cause we be making that big dough 
 You gotta keep a cold flow 
 Any way the wind blows 
 We be dropping that info 
 And we be making that big dough 
 We be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You gotta keep a cold flow 
 Any way the wind blows 
 We be dropping that info 
 And we be making that big dough 
 We be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh

 Heheheheheh, hahahahahahah 
 So, anything it takes to fight 
 Hehehehehehehe, hahahahahaha 
 As the snowflakes start to fall 
 Bobby thought to himself, can he possibly survive? 
 Then out of nowhere a stream of energy struck 
 As he boosted, joined energy wit the Sun 
 The Seven is shining, and the kids all felt happy! 
 You are listening to the worlwide Digital Radio Show 
 Where we play hiphop uncut, unedited 
 Wit very few commercial interruptions 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yeah, Bobby, word 
 BOODOODOODOODOODOO 
 Why? Where? Where? 
 BOODOODOODOODOODOO 
 Just Bobby, yo, Digi Digi 
 DOODOODOODOO, yo, yo.. 
  
 We interupt this program to bring you a special bulletin 
 Bob Digital located inside the hood again 
 Last seen helpin the crack fiend in detox 
 Smackin this cat in his head for snatchin Reeboks 
 Cut the dreadlocks, son, now rock the bald Caesar 
 Allow God to slip through the shit more easier 
 Police pulsated that they almost trapped Bobby 
 Near the staircase outside a 240 lobby 
 But son just disappeared in thin air 
 Where you crab niggas want to go, I've been there 
 Carry big guns, without bein parried 
 Yo, Cali niggas say its carried 
 Yo, don't waste your mind on time, don't chase the blind 
 Don't eat swine, don't play with loaded 9's 
 Don't quote weak rhymes 
 If you approached by a brother in need, give him shine 
 Show him light, don't get emotional, son, don't fight 
 Unless it's self-defense, to break the savage backs 
 So he's crew could be convinced 
 That any time you cross the line, we snap spines 
 Split ya melon, down to the rind 
 You be fucked up, yo.. 
 From the way I talk, no tellin what you might hear 
 BOODOODOODOO 
 The words of wisdom is like a magnet to the ear 
  
 [Break - RZA] 
 We've come to +Show U Love+, son, we've come to show you 
 Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you 
 Wu-Tang +Show U Love+, so let me show you 
 Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you 
 I said, we've come to +Show U Love+, son, so let me show you 
 Whether you my bitch, my nigga, or I don't know you 
  
 [RZA] 
 Bobby stainless, son, you must be brainless 
 Drill through ya jugular vein with my canis 
 Do love your brother, son, do show kindness 
 Do speak the truth, deal in refinement 
 Love God, or there'll be iron flyin at you 
 From 4 corners of the Earth, God's eyein at you 
 A wall full of eyes, makin demons in disguise 
 As naked women, walkin sour lemon 
 Every head, high-pitched bird, fly canary 
 Body's vary, tck-a-chk, wisdom is secondary 
 The most necessary, they daze you 
 And blaze you, faze you out 
 Wu-Tang razor blade may raise you 
 Wafflehead cats, you get sent back to Belgium 
 Don't have to tell 'em, like Taking of the Pelham 
 1-2-3, Bobby showed up, ya shit blowed up 
 Have ODB in the back with the Mac, son was tote up 
 Quick to snatch ya wiz, we sport Polo lenses 
 Logo organic, herbal fresh, hypoallergenic 
 You get stabbed by the +Shaolin Finger Jab+ 
 Then nabbed, hung by ya toe like fresh skin slab 
  
 [Break - RZA] 
 Whether Aryan, Rastafarian, Syrian 
 African, Black, Humanitarian, Bolivian 
 We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you 
 Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you 
 Wu-Tang will +Show U Love+, so let me show you 
 Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you 
 Don't have to come in this shit and make me blow you 
 We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you 
 Yo.. so let me show you 
 Wu-Tang Killa Bees, son, what? We told you 
 We've come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you 
 Whether you my nigga, my bitch, or I don't know you 
 Wu-Tang Killa Bees, son, what? Don't make me blow you 
 Come to +Show U Love+, so let me show you

 Pssh.. Head split.. jigged up by the ice pick![Intro: RZA] 
 This mic is scared of me, son 
 It's like I'm gonna rape it 
 Ason in my heart... 
 I date rape mics, my mic's a dike 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
  
 [Hook 2X: The Emotions "I Like It" sample] 
 Don't be afraid to call my name

 Don't be afraid to call my name 
  
 [RZA] 
 I've been blessed by the scent of cathedrals, I'm regal royal 
 Spoiled, I sleep with paralegals 
 And tongue kiss lawyers and cops, buy a pound of chocolate 
 Off the block, then I puff with the NARC's 
  
 My Clan's wild cannibal, Wu, and my man'll shoot 
 Blaow, leave your cold grippers mad with the saddest truth 
 From banana head chunks, propaganda pumps 
 Leave 'em buried on the Staten Island dump 
  
 Tap the mic on the floor, chains to the Mighty Thor 
 Two blades on my arm, look like the God of War 
 Ason in my heart, yeah, I like it raw 
 Words in the apple, I'mma bite it to the core 
  
 Digitech, used to call me Prince Dynamite 
 Cuz when I blew up the set, you couldn't find a mic 
 Leave your ass in the dark, you can't find the light 
 You been wrong so long, you can't find the right 
  
 Way to speak, I spend a day on the beats 
 Then a day on the paper, then a day on the beach 
 Then a night in the sheets with fine wizzes, dime wizzes 
 Who don't waste time to get straight down to business 
  
 Zig Zag, make your girl catch a whip lash 
 Tried to look when she seen the God zip past 
 Money stack high up like a skyscraper 
 Fly shorties getting stuck to my fly paper 
  
 Now we march to the monument 
 You see the seven in the star on the amulet? 
 Don't allow negative in my circumference 
 You can't understand, son, you incompetent 
  
 The P is free, would you fuck for a million bucks? 
 Keep the steel concealed, in the wheel of trucks 
 ShaCronz put the rhinestone on the rims 
 Timbo King put the rhinestones on his Timbs 
  
 We live this life each and every day 
 We all trying to make it a better way 
 If you miss the words that I say 
 Hit pause, record, and hit play 
  
 I'm backed by a beautiful strong wiz 
 Bless all to the Earths and all the kids 
 Long live the God Divine and Big Free 
 Young seeds and great kings 
  
 [Hook 4X][Intro: sample] 
 See the joy of life beginning 
 See the joy of life beginning 
 Oh sweet joy! 
 A brand new baby boy 
  
 [Verse: RZA] 
 My mind flashed back to the early moon 
 When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube 
 In the midst of a state of triple darkness 
 Going through a struggle so I could exist 
 Avoiding everything that came within my path 
 As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half 
 One out of a million completes the job 
 And for the other sperm cells the womb is a graveyard 
 Though my travels I had to pass through 
 A lot of battles and violent hassles 
 'Cause inside the womb I was a foreign object 
 I'm like a new nigga walking through the project 
 Trouble, everywhere I turn 
 Damn it's a struggle just being a sperm 
 Cell, so I attempt to prevail 
 I guess the womb is the first stage of hell 
 Now here I am in the danger zone 
 My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes 
 But then again yo it can't be that bad 
 'Cause my dad he could have used a body bag 
 And if so then my tomb 
 Would have been the trash can inside my mom's bedroom 
 But they was fucking, they was true to this 
 And here I go on a mission to the uterus 
 A million motherfuckers tried to race ahead 
 But I was the one that fertilized the egg 
 Then I thought then I was safe 
 Because I reached home base 
 But oh no my job wasn't done 
 In fact my troubles had only begun 
 Life is a struggle, life is the struggle 
 Life is the struggle c'mon 
  
 [Outro: sample] 
 See the joy of life beginning 
 See the joy of life beginning 
 Oh sweet joy!

 Malibu, coconut rum, Amaretto sour, coke & rum 
 We gettin' drunk, Hennessey, V.S.O.P 
 Age in the barrel, thirty-three years

 Milwaukee's best, for those who only got two dollars and a bag of cess

 All we wanna do is drink, smoke and fuck (fuck!)

 Chronic, blubonic, chocolate Thai stick, you want it 
 Jamaican green, silver haze, the Northern Lights get ya ass in a daze 
 Purple hydro, Indonesian skunks, you can tell by the funk 
 All we need is Fonzo' leaf or a blunt 
 Ez-Wider, Bambú, I prefer the Dutch 
 Split the back open, then the weed get crushed 
 Bic lighter gettin' sparked, we procede to puff

 Her cousin Tawanna, she's hairy like Chewbacca 
 Always trynna smoke on that chewbacca 
 Suck a dick dry for two shots of that Vodka

 All my bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Let me tell a motherfucker something 
 Ya'll motherfuckers want this money, bitch? 
 You better earn this motherfuckin' money

 My name Dirt Dog, bitch, ain't no frontin' 
 Bitch, let me show you somethin' 
 My name Dirt Dog, bitch, ain't no frontin' 
 Aaah! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Walkin' down the street, dark, dark night 
 Saw a pretty girl, bitch caught my sight 
 Bitch, so fine—fine as can be 
 Bitch, you know you belong to me 
 Drove over, said, "How you be?" 
 Bitch, you know my name Dirt Dog, dirt MC 
 "Dirt Dog—I know what you about." 
 "Bitch, get the fuck in the car!" Drove her to my house 
 Aaaah, to my house 
 Open the door, take off your clothes 
 Throw her on the floor, took off my clothes 
 Showed her my dick, "Bitch, dis somethin' that you'll never forget." 
 On the first pump she started to scream 
 On the second pump she thought she had a bad dream 
 On the third pump she started to cry 
 "Dirt Dog, I don't wanna die!" 
 "Just, shut the fuck up!" 
 Pussy ain't nothin' but the skin of ya bone 
 You can fuck it, you can suck, you can leave it alone 
 25 cents is the regular price 
 50 cent, you can fuck it twice 
 75 cent, you can fuck it to the bone 
 And a dollar' worth—leave it alone!

 Put your guns in your right hand and hold it down towards the floor 
 Point all your guns down towards the floor for a minute 
 Yeah, you could hold 'em, just point 'em down towards the floor 
 For a sec, aight? (Yo y'all ain't fuckin' wit the Wu) 
 We gon' splash like this, all my wild Digi heads

 Y'all niggas know what I'm talkin' about 
 Word up, my weedheads, y'all play the right for a second

 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Walk wit a diddy bop ock, you silly pop, Jiffy Pop 
 Fuck around, son, I'll blow ya face up with fifty shots 
 Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts 
 Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod 
 Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it 
 Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it 
 I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine 
 Three-eleven that rips through Power-U's and breaks spines 
 I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin' 
 Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin' 
 Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup 
 That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club 
 Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right? 
 Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike 
 I played the cipher in the corner, teachin' math 
 One for one thoughts, a hundred brothers won't last 
 "Do U" 
 Because you can't do me 
 "Do U" 
 Because you can't do me 
 Come on! 
  
 [Verse 2: Prodigal] 
 Yo, son, Wake Up! 
 Yo, I gotta do this, man 
 I gotta get this money, son 
  
 Features in the crowd, appearance like, "Black I'm proud" 
 In the background, no sounds, four pound, we hold ground! 
 Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown 
 One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down 
 Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines 
 All I wanna do is feed my seed, plus my team 
 Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal 
 Diabolic drums and I run from none 
 Testimony one, give my life before my only son 
 Thelonious crumbs, why they wanna press me for guns? 
 Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug 
 From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs 
 As it was written, stroll through any block forbidden 
 Glock hidden, why they wanna stop precision? 
 Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison 
 And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin' 
 But Do U! Do U! Do U! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: GZA] 
 You know those jams in the park, produced the spark 
 Made me feel words how I read books in the dark 
 I always took it to heart, loved the art 
 A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart 
 Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport 
 Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort 
 I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood 
 Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood 
 Once I electrify and only expect to die 
 Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry 
 My opponent block, the beat comin' from his box 
 Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks 
 Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance 
 Movin' in steps of unheard of silence 
 Normally progressioners, they're slow steepin' 
 Niggas wanna light up when there's gas leakin' 
  
 [Hook: RZA and sample] 
 "Do U feel?"[RZA]

 You see these wizards out here, trynna floss like 
 I wear the pants dada, I'm the boss papa 
 I'm a Survivor! I play the course dada 
 They got the little toy vibrators on there speed, chacha 
 See I don't need a man, don't need to see a man 
 But it seems to me ho, you wanna be a man 
 You Tinkerbell and your girlfriend is Peter Pan 
 Strap on the KY Jelly, you wanna eat ya friend 
  
 [Big Gipp] 
 I know the type, come down and take a little pipe 
 Then run up and call me cupcakes, say "I didn't fuck you right" 
 Shit, call me now, like that bitch on the tube with the tarot cards 
 Cuz, mushy gushy still goin for sale on the Boulevard 
 Now I didn't I see, didn't I see you walk on the porno flicks 
 Givin' brain at the same, give no bumper hit 
 Get them bent accross seas, damn near done rapped the world 
 And you qualify, my book here's a nasty girl

 You ain't shit, yo mama ain't shit 
 Yo daddy ain't shit, yo pussy ain't shit, bitch

 Hey Bobby, I know this loot gobbler, hard knobber 
 More peaches than cobbler, corner store soliciter 
 Drawers up her ass wipe, what you want 
 And what you need, and what you get is two different things 
 Pulled over, Pea Street, and put the bitch out in the rain 
 Lost your mind, ya 409, riding the short yellow bus 
 Gipp ain't never been touched, left insane, drunk off of (?) lush 
 Hush, shit-kicker licker, stronger than Wild Turkey liquor 
 Tryin to entice her, movin to hit her, but I'd rather forget her nigga

 Bodododo, plus her knees be purple, Gipp, she like to gurgle gurgle 
 And goggle, goggle, slurpy slurp and she swallow swallow 
 I met this Caramel Sundae, her name was Betty Boo 
 She put her period blood in her spaghetti stew (fuck no! fuck no!) 
 I knew her mama, her papa, plus her naughty daughter 
 She filled her baby's ba-ba up with toilet water 
 And Sun Dew, the whole Clan used to run threw 
 Her Power U, then just bless her wit the hair doo 
 Bitch, I pack a horse dick, plus you know my chain is frosted 
 One fuck from the apple head and shorty lost it

 Bobby Steels, Staple' tales 
 MCs get your lips stapled 
 Project Killa Hill 
 Is stamped on the map like the compass 
 Sacred sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you 
 You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts 
 Blast through your box, walk with alarm clocks 
 Cars driving slow down the block 
 One stopped, parks, pops his trunk 
 Snares pops loud as Glock shots 
 Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation 
 We pause for radio station identification 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up 
 Love our queue got you drunk, you request the Wu 
 Flying monks fatal darts in your airwaves, strike ya antenna 
 You feel the bass shimmer 
 It makes your light get dimmer 
 Before you turn your dial from this 
 You best to slit your wrists 
 Through the soul of your heart like Don Cornelius 
 Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer 
 Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature 
 In your atmosphere the rap racketeer 
 Six pack battery back, keeps 'em stacked 
 I live for hip-hop 
 And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipops 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

 "Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!" 
 "Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!"(Prince Rakeem & Girl Talking) 
 Yes aoow 
 Sexy Stuff 
 Aoo, oh Yeah! Definetly, ph Yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Rakeem: I got too many ladies, I got to learn to say no 
 Woman: Ohh, We Love You Rakeem 
 Rakeem: I got too many ladies, yo, I got to learn to say no 
 Woman: Ohh, We Love You Rakeem, Ohh Rakeem 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Time is moving slow, life is a drag 
 This money to make ya, more girls to bag 
 Fully aware, so I step upon the square 
 Lookin for what? The cooty and the chair 
 Flex and I flex on the opposite sex 
 Hit 'em off quick and step to the next 
 It seems I'm a fiend for a sex routine 
 Love to hear them scream 
 (Woman: Ohh Rakeem) 
 And my response is "Oh" 
 Always satisfy them, you know how I flow 
 But since I'm not lazy, I'm buck wild and crazy 
 I kiss the bussom, but never eat the daisies 
 And my ladies love me deeply 
 Because I'm handsome, charming and freaky 
 And when they need me, they won't go 
 And now I'm stuck, I should've said no 
  
 Chorus 2: 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: And I love you to 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Thank you 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Your far too kind 
 Woman: Ohh Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Gosh 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: You feeling mutual love 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Oh do you? 
 Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Hmmmmm 
 Woman: Ohh Rakeem 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 When I walk down the block 
 The girls stop and clock 
 They hop on my jock, cause I got mad props 
 Tall & slim with the brown skin conflection 
 Half them sweating my love and affection 
 As I collect them, I must want to protect them 
 Love them deeply, but never disrespect them 
 I keep a tab on the large amount 
 But sometimes I find myself losing count 
 Of Latika, Diane, Lisa 
 Stephanie, Jackie, Teresa 
 Sharonda, um um, Veronica 
 Latasha, Sinthia & Monica 
 Nevertheless, you must give respect 
 To the femine queens that the God selects 
 I love them all, but even though 
 I'm rather happy, I should've said no 
 But yet my ego gets in the way 
 And always something that I'll never say 
 I'd just bag them, keep 'em under my wing 
 Put them in a posse, and let them all sing 
  
 Chorus 2(Rakeem saying these lines instead) 
 Do you? 
 Say it again baby 
 Yes I like it 
 Come on you can say it louder 
 Cuz I love you all 
 Thank you 
 Rakeem Allah the greatest baby

 Yo, the great Digi 
 "What are you looking for?" 
 The World's greatest mind 
 Bob Digital 
 "Man with no mother" 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, try to cross reference, my epic preference 
 Fresh mint, tight lint, you get trapped inside the monkey wrench 
 Ain't no landlubber ever gonna suit the sailor 
 I'm blessed like the seed who sucked the milk from Mahalia 
 You wishin' Shaolin Island could be swallowed up by the sea 
 Gobbled up, like the lost city of Mu and Atlantis 
 But I'm fierce as the cyclone winds that blew through Kansas 
 Have your clan stranded on the enchanted land of Gomer-Oz-Dabar 
 GEM Blue Star, razor blade scar 
 Who dare wanna spar bar for bar? Allah U Akbar 
 I turn the most degenerate hood into a pop star 
 Bless the seed who prays the Most High, without askin' why 
 Flicks from ocean shore, kick like Marshall Law 
 I might strike with the eagle claw or tiger paw 
 On the shores of African beach, facin' the east 
 White sands stretched out as far as the eye can see 
 Found buried by the sea 
 The heat of Allah son will crack through Antarctica 
 We ride blue whales, you sell Nautica ships on the carpenter 
 We should send all these Devils back to Hell 
 You small as to die in my sentence, I speak with vengeance 
 Snatch up 17 million plus 2 million Indians 
 Your incorrect retrospect on the situation 
 You didn't know it was a Wu-Tang affiliation 
 Legs weak like twigs, you're forbidden like pig 
 You can't fuck with the Zig-Zag-Zig 
  
 [Break: RZA] 
 Raise your sword, and praise the Lord 
 And wage war on this wicked society 
 Raise your sword, and praise the Lord 
 And wage war on this wicked society 
  
 [RZA] 
 The village must be pillaged 
 The merciless, the Earth is damp from blood spillage 
 Cursed the ancestors and the seed of the assailant 
 Dissect his body like an alien 
 My seed must be spread 
 I bust sperm cells with Bobsleds 
 Then race to the egg and bring forth the 
 Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head 
 All you niggas out there who got money 
 Better watch out for the money hungry 
 Straight up... 
 The most beloved from a region undiscovered 
 I've been hovered over by black buzzard walkin' through public 
 Imagine the feelin' of growin' up, ten children 
 Stuffed inside a shack, in the project buildings 
 Women, infants and coupons, one stole Campbell's soup on 
 Stressed out with four kids, aborter 
 Next door the dope fiend neighbour tryin' to sell his little daughter 
 Poisonous, heat from the oven 
 The only way we had to live was survivin' off mommy's lovin' 
 Dead bodies found in the incinerator 
 Lights Out, somebody fucked up the generator 
 Talkin' welfare, cheese, franks and beans 
 Mud stains on mock-neck shirts and tainted jeans 
 Twisted up, how the fuck we get bended up? 
 And ended up in this four block radius where they enslaved us 
 Sweatin' from cheese ravioli with tomato sauce and anchovie 
 Spoiled, ah shit, my blood boiled 
 But fuck that, I'm ready for open hand combat 
 It's the tomcat, and my thoughts are unlimited 
 Inflicted fatal wounds and I'm immune, to your evil society 
  
 [Break: RZA] 
 So praise the Lord and and wage war 
 Against this wicked society, society 
 Praise the Lord and raise your sword 
 Against this wicked society, society 
 Praise the Lord and raise your sword 
 Against this wicked society 
  
 [RZA] 
 There was a Legend of a Liquid Sword 
 That was Only Built 4 Niggas with Cuban Linx 
 Who +Entered the 36th Chamber+ 
 And keep the true links, inherit +The W+ emblem 
 Movin' the muscle changin' and bone tendon bendin' 
 Science of 25 thousand year millennium 
 The sinners from the men who exiled the Indians from India 
 Who's times can't be measured linear 
 In all tribes on Earth who can't find a friendlier group of people 
 Who shunt all evil, treat all men equal 
 Even though we see through your wicked intentions 
 We gave you land to experiment with your inventions 
 But you strive for global lynchin', extension 
 But it's yourself that will become extinct 
 You inherit this power to think and build things 
 The free will to love, not hate or kill things 
 And when you went astray, we sent prophets to reveal things 
 And left scriptures behind to fulfill things 
 But you still wanna kill things, rob and steal things 
 So don't blame us when it's time to fulfill things and kill Kings 
  
 [Break: RZA] 
 Raise the sword and praise the Lord 
 On this wicked society, society 
 Raise your sword and praise the Lord 
 It's a wicked society, society 
 Praise the Lord and raise your sword 
 Against this wicked society 
 Wage war 
 Against this wicked society

 Used to break days smokin' coke and digi

 Face green, knuckles burst out like Wolverine 
 Should I rip this bitch pussy or go pull a sting? 
 Fatal guillotine carrier, boy, ya'll niggas know me 
 Wrap niggas in sheets, fold 'em like the roll singing

 Clarks, jewelry, bitches, jeans, darts is his medicine 
 Y'all can't build me, your technique's Ecederin 
 Look, I will take my time in the bushes, right 
 Paid up people no mind like I'm crooked, right 
 Shoot a nigga on down, do him somethin' right 
 He on the floor, tell his grams, "yo I seen the light" 
 The red car it just pulled off like Un Hall was drivin' the joint

 Yo, I make your fragile bones rattle with battles, chrome barrels 
 Microphone arrows thrown strike like stone paddles 
 To ya head, you'll be spread across the floor 
 Dead and headed for a bed of roses 
 Needle threaded, one jaw off-set'ed 
 By the fatal blow, tornado blow, battleship 
 Naval boats, U-boat torpedo, you can't stay afloat 
 You sink to the brink of extincted animals 
 While I bang your head on the turntbuckle wild like George the Animal 
 Steel stinger, Killa Bee ten inches, sharp as picket fences 
 Quick to detect your intentions if they're wicked 
 Meditate, build the house on the next dimension 
 My flow is co-hension, you'll be stuck 
  
 [Hook] 
 Stumbled into the lab half-drunk 
 Honey-dipped, stinking blunts 
 Smelling like I ran over I skunk 
 Wiz popping junk, it must be that time of the month 
 But fuck it, I got to spit this verse from my lung 
 Stumbled inside my lab half-drunk 
 Honey-dipped, stinking blunts 
 Smelling like I ran over I skunk 
 Wiz popping junk, it must be that time of the month 
 But fuck it, I got to spit this verse from my lung 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Pile drive your head to the canvas 
 On this mic you got no fuckin manners 
 You be duckin hammers, we be clutchin banners 
 Touchin amateur challengers, we try to throw off balance us 
 Keep a 120 grain gunpowder inside the cannister 
 You can't compare to one atom of my hair 
 While my verbal shot be drillin through the cave of your ear 
 Ricohet to the ceilin, of the cerebral hemisphere 
 Deflect off your medula, exit out to the rear 
 MCin is easier to me than breathin 
 And makin beats to me is easier than peein 
 Killin vibes is easier than seein 
 I be geein, and fuckin with the Wu-Tang Clan is wilder 
 Bitch, than skiin down a 1000 foot hill with broke skis 
 Blocked by rocks, wild billy ghost, steel needle pine trees 
 My mind sees all of the unusual energies 
 Tell me, have you ever felt a sunshine breeze?

 {Verse 3] 
 Yo, your flower fist is powerless against me 
 Your cowardice attacks the master track alchemist, Rap Malcolm 
 My champagne stains silver, bullet lex 4 
 Millenium falcon, chest in a vest to protect the Wu-Tang's sacred valium 
 Chased by snake's planes, I race states police 
 We slay microphone foes, the size of robeasts 
 Unpredictable pain is inflictable 
 Razor blade will ripple you, death blow will cripple you 
 12.9 meter level, son, you just skipped all my classes 
 IhHit a rap gkid with glasses, then jack his bus passes 
 His sister was similar to Jaqueline Onassis 
 My sound chassis blast, rhyme script written, well-casted 
 Strong as safari hunter, calm in the Congo 
 Un-plug the dynamic microphone cord and hung you 
 From a towerin' speaker, I'll tape your ear to the tweater 
 My mental idea's are more severe than your heater 
 Innocent drive-bys, 85's shoot try to overthrow us 
 But they love us like babies, once they get to know us 
 Your flower fist is powerless against me

 He who go through snow, rain, mountain or ice 
 Nothing can block ya, this path of vengeance 
 There's no repenting, he came to deliver 
 Out the death sentence, on enemies 
 Blood stains on the cotton field by the cotton mill 
 Cold steel keep the body hot, they rot in hell 
 36 lashes on his back, left gashes 
 Every crack of the whip, he got mental flashes 
 They interrupt his baby making, and his lady's taken 
 To a far off place, more north and more forsaken 
 Lord help these fools, they be dead man 
 Bout to put a third hole in their Klan headbands 
 The good Dr. Schultz check their dental records 
 The slug make his whole mug disconnected 
 They learn to shoot, doing the dead man tango 
 He's wild like a wild durango

 He get Cash Rule to blast you 
 Tie you up, have you hung from his lasso 
 And drag you through the valley of death like ruined cattle 
 The D is silent, hear the noise from his barrel 
 Learned to shoot and do the dead man tango 
 Wild like a durango, but the D is silent, Django 
 Tie you up, have you hung from the lasso 
 Give him a gun, and he gets paid just to blast you 
 Drag you through the valley of death, like ruined cattle 
 The D is silent, hear the noise from the barrel 
 And whistle of the song, like a fucking carol 
 In the eyes of the sparrow 
 Every father would love to overthrow a tyrant 
 It's a simple science, Jack overthrows the giant 
 Neither snow, rain, mountain or ice can block my path of vengeance 
 There's no repenting, I'm giving you the death sentence 
 Blood stains on the cotton field, in the cotton mill 
 Cold steel heat your body up, may you rot in hell 
 36 lashes, on my back, left gashes 
 For every crack of the whip, I felt mental flashes 
 Interrupt my baby making, have my ladies taken 
 To a place far up north and more forsaken 
 Lord, help this fool he's a dead man 
 Bout to put another hole in his Klan headband 
 The good Dr. Schultz check the dental records 
 The slug'll make his whole mug disconnected 
 I learnt to shoot the dead man with a tango

 Refugees of the Terrorist, fans, they fuckin love it 
 Insurance can't cover it, your maximum is a minimum

 Yo three months ago we was on, but it's on now 
 Chasin the don, your money ain't long 
 Faggot fuck, bag em up, stick him in the back of my truck 
 Strip em and smack him up for actin up

 Broke the code of honor that we livin in 
 Could lead to the whole click, dismemberin' 
 Never that, Killarm roll strong 
 Even though you gone, Wise, the crew will still hold on 
 I love you, in that dream, you probably told me who bust you 
 Should of payed attention but I slept so for that

 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, thieves-[cut off][Spoken Introduction: Unknown] 
 Bobby! 
 Warum bist Du in unser Land gekommen? 
 Warum bist Du in mein Leben gekommen? 
 Du hast meine Frau gefickt, meine Kinder sind verrückt nach Dir, und ich bin so glücklich. Ha 
 Bobby! 
 Bobby Digital!! 
 Wer bist Du? Wer bist Du? Du bist im Grunde ein Teufel, der in die Hölle gehört. Aber eigentlich ein Engel, der aus dem Himmel kommt 
 Bobby... Bobby... Bobby Digital1. Can you describe what the reaction was from everyone was after Inspectah deck first laid down his verse in Triumph? 
  
 RZA - He slayed it. And everybody knew it. And everybody else tried to slay. But he slayed it 
 2. Did Ol' Dirty really live up to the craziness that he portrayed in his music? 
  
  
 RZA - Times ten 
 3. What happened first, you naming yourself RZA or your cousin naming himself GZA? 
  
 RZA - I named myself the RZA first, and I named him the GZA shortly thereafter 
 4. Did anything inspire you with regards to the choice of beats on Enter the 36 Chambers? Also, are you still an avid chess player? :D 
  
 RZA - On 36 Chambers, I kind of went on my own inspiration. I was out to prove my abilities. Yes, I still play chess 
 5. Will we ever get 36 chambers remastered? 
  
 RZA - Perhaps some of the tracks will be remastered. A lot of them are probably not in multitrack form anymore. So the remaster would still have to come from a stereo mix 
 6. Ever give any thought to writing/directing a Wu Tang Clan movie to tie in with an album? 
  
 RZA - Yes, actually. Although making movies is very difficult and it's hard to get green lights, I'm going to keep pushing though. And maybe one day, it will see the light 
 7. Do I still have to protect ma neck? It's been like 20 years now, I'm getting tired of doing it 
 Love you man. As a producer, as a rapper, as an actor, as a videogame character, ANY dj 
  
 RZA - You have to protect ya neck til the day you drop brother. Because if you lose ya neck, that will be the day you drop! You must always protect ya neck at all times 
 8. Long time fan of the Wu. I was amazed by the Kill Bill soundtracks 
 Don't know if you can answer this: Will the Ghostface/MF DOOM album ever be released? 
  
 RZA - I don't know. But Ghost is one of the dopest MCs, and MF is a dope producer and MC. So I'm sure if they do it, it's going to be great 
 9. What's your favorite movie, and why is it How High? 
  
 RZA - Hahahahaheeehohohahaha. Lay off the drugs, cat. LOL 
 10. I have some beat production related questions: 
 - What's your usual setup? All digital? Any analog instruments? Vinyl sampling?   - What DAW do you prefer? 
 -Do you make beats, then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together? 
 - Do you have a specific process for finding samples, or is it all gut feeling? 
  
 RZA - Well, that's a lot, but: not being egotistic about this, but I have a dozen set ups. And my home studio I use different rooms for setups. So one room is just turntables and a sampler, another would be just keyboards, another will be a digital room, there's one room where everything is analog (live drums, guitars, etc). As a composer, you always need different sounds, so after working with Hans Zimmer, I've learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes 
  
 I prefer writing songs together. In fact one of the problems with making a Wu-Tang album is my refusal to send beats, because I believe that great music is created when people are in a room together 
  
 I dig and I dig, and if something strikes my ear, I sample it. Then I twist it 
 11. PEACE 
 Do you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crab's hand with them? 
  
 RZA - No. I gave them to my little brother and I think he lost em 
 12. Do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment? 
  
 RZA - Uh oh. It's getting deep on AMA. We said AMAA. But now that you asked, you better be aware of yourself and your partner(s) 
 13. How did you like your time on Californication? Samurai Apocalypse was a great foil to Hank Moody 
  
 RZA - It was very fun. Funny. And something was very sexy about that show. Maybe it was Meagan. LOL 
 14. Hey RZA! Tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in Wu Tang: ) 
  
 RZA - Here's a story, it may not be funny depending on your point of view, but one time the whole Clan was in Atlanta, and I guess we caused some kind of riot in the building, and thus the police was brought in to end the show. I remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence, but one cop had got a grab of Inspector Deck and he couldn't get free. When we noticed it, me and Method Man rushed back over to help, but actually, what could we do? We can't hit a cop, could we? That would not have been wise. Instead, Method Man grabbed onto Inspector Deck's arm, and combined his strength with Inspector Deck, which allowed them to get away from the cop, they broke his grip and we all ran. I later told Meth "That was some Wu-Tang Kung fu shit right there." 
 15. How was working with Earl Sweatshirt? I've heard that during the making of Molasses, you spit a freestyle for three hours 
  
 RZA - Yeah, we got zoned out that night. He's a cool cat. And I think he will be a great talent in hiphop 
 16. Hey RZA, how did you become a vegetarian? 
  
 RZA - I just snapped out of eating dead animals 
 17. BONG BONG! Been a fan for 20+ years 
 2 questions: 
 Whats your all time favorite Martial Arts flick? 
 What is your favorite ODB verse/line/metaphor/song? 
  
 RZA - I'll tell you the 3 that inspired me the most. Shaolin versus Wu-Tang. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. And the Five Deadly Venoms 
 For ODB "I be the answer to your why, the tear to your cry." It's off a song he did with Killer Priest 
 18. Who's the best chess player in the Wu Tang Clan right now? 
  
 RZA - Hahahahahahaha. All I can say is that I had the hiphop chess belt 
 19. What was it about Gravediggaz, and the horrorcore genre in general, that appealed to you when it was first starting? 
  
 RZA - At the time, being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares, I wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. I feel like the Gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. Hiphop could use a few more doses of it now 
 20. Hey RZA! You seem to be a very calculated, meditative and, for lack of a better word, spiritual person. Was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way you've always been? 
 Peace & thanks for the AMA 
  
 RZA - Yes, certain events led me to this, which is hard for me to describe to this, which are hard to describe. But I can say that it was a growth process. Would you believe I was once obnoxious 
 21. Can you share any memories of your tour with Rage Against the Machine? 
  
 RZA - That was one of the highlights of my career. At the time, Wu-Tang had the #1 album in the country, and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. One of my best memories is when Zack broke his leg on tour, and needed a little energy during the New Jersey show, and I came out and rocked the stage with him. The rest of the Wu went home. :( 
 22. Have you considered being on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast? I can't remember if it was a tweet or during his own AMA, but Rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest 
  
 RZA - Yes, I would love to be on as a guest someday. I'll wait for the time for him to invite me 
 23. Hey RZA! really glad you're doing this AMA. I read somewhere that you and John Frusciante have recorded a ton of material. I really liked FM. Any chance you two might release a full album in the future? That would be awesome 
  
 RZA - here's a chance for that. If life permits 
 24. actor in Brick Mansions. AMAA 
 Hey hey now, let's not forget the awesome performance in "The Man with the Iron Fists!" 
 Good job man. How much fun is it being so versatile? 
  
 RZA - It's very challenging. Because some of my friends are thinking I'm becoming a little schizo. Wow, the life of an artist 
 25. I was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said "protect your neck" and I immediately thought of Wu-Tang and giggled to myself. What do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class? 
 Would bring a whole new meaning to "flow." 
  
 RZA - LOL 
 26. Many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. What would you say were the main reasons "Wu-Tang Forever" was made into a Double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album? Was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of "All Eyez on Me" or more that you wanted to get more music out? 
  
 RZA - Actually, a double-album was part creative, and part business. If i can recall, we hadn't done an album as Wu-Tang Clan for four years. And so we wanted to give Steve Rifkin an abundant amount of material. But also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it, they said "how about a double album?" 
 27. Prince Rakeem! Just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life (or at least my wallet) way back when 
 12 years ago, I’m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil. I’m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people. I’m 20 years old, young enough to think I’m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. This is one of those “favelas” that you hear about in the news. Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn’t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn’t belong. This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night 
 Well, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we were, we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. At first, the decision seems like the right one. The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn’t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we’ve used in the past, but now that it’s night I start to realize some things I hadn’t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It’s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my naïve little friend knows we’re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, “Perdidos?” and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask “You guys are Wu-Tang fans?” The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks “What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?” I respond by telling him that I’m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I’m saying. After all, I’m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn’t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another—names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles—I’m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they’re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy’s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew 
 From that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don’t know just how good of a thing that was 
 Edit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are 
 Edit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here 
  
 RZA - Wow 
 I always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother 
 28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy 
  
 RZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe 
 29. Wu-Tang Forever! 
 How much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible 
  
 RZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther 
 30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you! 
  
 RZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC 
 Choosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process 
 Pete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West 
 Yes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones 
 31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew? 
  
 RZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again 
 32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk? 
  
 RZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude 
 33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise? 
  
 RZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads 
 34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story? The legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of Wu-Tang solo albums 
 Did this actually happen? 
 Did you recreate any of the beats that you lost? If so, which ones? 
  
 RZA - Yeah, I lost a lot of beats. In those days, I would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder, which held 80 disks per case. And I had the cases sectioned out with names of each Wu member, and beats that fit their styles. Those disks have not been recovered yet. I have some of them, but they won't play 
 35. Hey RZA, Huge Fan here, I've been listening to you since I was 10. One question 
 Are you not going to publically publish songs off the new WuTang albulm, or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer? 
  
 RZA - The album, that's entitled A Better Tomorrow, if completed, will be available to the public. The album entitled Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made 
 36. When was the last time you saw Paul Walker? 
  
 RZA - The last time I saw Paul in the flesh was on the movie set. We had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. But destiny bends 
 37. How awesome is it being a Robert? 
 (Mine name is Robert) 
  
 RZA - Super duper awesome 
 38. How did you come up with the name RZA? 
  
 RZA - In my neighborhood, my homies would call me the RZA RZA Ra. Because they said I was razor-sharp. Ra was my chosen name, short for Rakeem. When I decided to improve myself, I changed my name to Rakeem Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah. And RZA is like an acronym for that 
 39. What's your favourite videogame? 
  
 RZA - Nowadays? Well it's hard to say your favorite video game, but one game I've been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is Tekken. Actually, when Wu-Tang first started making money, me and Method Man came to Manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games, and we tried to buy a Tekken to bring home to our house. And they wouldn't sell it to us at that time. Method Man would up getting one though. I wound up getting a pinball machine. Anyway, Tekken 
 40. You get a swimming pool but you can't fill it with water, what do you fill it with? Money is not a choice either 
  
 RZA - Those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits 
 41. Liquid Swords II when? 
 Btw Liquid Swords is the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time 
  
 RZA - I think GZA may be in the process of writing that now[Intro: sample] 
 Bird flying high, you know how I feel 
 Sun in the sky, you know how I feel 
 Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel 
 It's a new dawn, it's a new day 
 It's a new life for... 
 Bird flying high, you know how I feel 
 Sun in the sky, you know how I feel 
 Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel 
 It's a new dawn, it's a new day 
 It's a new life for me

 You see that's what we called B-Boy freestyle!

 "sha na na!"[Intro: Islord] 
 Aiyyo, let me tell y'all niggas somethin' 
 One thing, let me tell y'all niggas somethin' 
 I don't give a, flyin' fuck about 
 None of y'all niggas out here 
 None of y'all niggas out here 
 Cause you ain't, none of my motherfuckin' comrades 
 I don't give a, flyin' fuck, what? 
 You want it? Bring it son, bring it son 
 Bring it, yo, check it on out 
  
 [Ndira: talking over Islord above] 
 Bobby, como puede ser que me jodistes? 
 Hijo de puta 
 [?] el coño de mi, maricon 
 Y nunca me llamas, Roberto 
 You treat me like an analog ho 
  
 [Verse 1: Islord] 
 Yo, lyrically, I got all y'all niggas under my wing 
 Cause I bring terror throughout this rap era 
 Like them Muslim cats, who don't give a fuck 
 About blowin' this rock, off the map 
 Where Mayor Guiliani rest at, so let me get that 
 Microphone up off of you, cause it's 
 Definitely not meant for you to have it in your palm 
 To try to rock the crowd 
 Puttin' it all on to stay calm 
 You waited for the God Islord to drop the bomb 
 And swarm the stage about a hundred fat 
 With lyrical material that's all that 
 Like a two point five carat clustered jew-el 
 Rock like Patti La-Belle 
 Cause everything is real kid, you dead up 
 Dissect the true kids gettin' set up 
 For a car/Jeep heist, it ain't nice 
 As we ran up in the crib and stuck the kid 
 And smacked the wife, cause she, had on two chains 
 With a tray full of ice in 'em 
 But that's how it goes down when you livin in the Cold World 
  
 [Interlude: Timbo King] 
 Cold World, what? 
  
 [Hook: Ndira] 
 Todo lo que a ti te gustas es music pa' lo puta 
  
 [Verse 2: Timbo King] 
 Yo, I spit flames thermonuclear type 
 Ignite mics, blow up U.S.A. satellites 
 Insane Unabomber, my whole fam lace golden armor 
 Royal calmer, black queen black Madonna 
 The missing link be the big lips on the Sphinx 
 Intelligent instincts 
 I say knowledge is the foundation 
 When I move in the L's formation, against Hell's nation 
 Bobby Digital cybertech test micro-check 
 High bias, record the levels 
 Anti four devils, anti four devils 
  
 [Bridge: Ndira] 
 Bobby, como puede ser que me jodistes? 
 Hijo de puta

 Y nunca me llamas 
 Me tratas like an analog ho, Roberto 
 Nadie te importa, cariño 
 I wanna be Digital Bobby 
 Bobby Digital 
 RZA me advertio de Bobby 
 Bobby Digital 
  
 [Verse 3: Bobby Digital] 
 All you analog cats from weak tracks and weak raps 
 And weak video clips and weak stacks 
 Weak bitches with weak lawyers and weak acts 
 And weak staffs, born life couldn't copyright 
 With weak math, come get a dose of the strong 
 Coconuts splittin', all you chocolate deluxe butter alms 
 French buttercups probably wanna see Bobby in handcuffs 
 With the toes in my mouth 
 Stand up or rape me, rotate auto-locate me 
 In the center solar 
 Corner block Hip-Hop now expand to the polar 
 Fuzzy low short frequency 
 Circuit breakers, try to take 
 Us on illusionary rides to the future 
 Polygram graphic rap actors, flash ya 
 Cash and jewelry like bus passes 
 That's why your ass got stuck up 
 So wake the fuck up or get smoked 
 Analog rhymes hoes are like groupies we fucked 
 Took for derelict, sales are too soupy 
 Better get the Bobby Digital movie! 
  
 [Hook: Ndira] 
 Todo lo que a ti te gustas es music pa' lo puta 
  
 [Verse 4: Ghostface Killah] 
 Tarantula, that groove season 
 Newlywed of rap, which G you believe in? 
 Rally back, twist a half a man arm off 
 Late night, nearly happy standoff 
 How boldly blinded by Bobby crossthievin' van diva 
 Lever 2000 mic talk, might bolt to match 
 Pinch me in the eve carved perfectly from God 
 Manufactured through the eye, same Puma dash 
 I snares Dumar, Nicolas, half a face, Cage 
 Half a coke Dutch sprinkle sage 
 Bounce to Huey crib yo and got laid 
 Straight off the ground y'all word up 
 …Bad bitch 
  
 [Verse 5: Jamie Sommers] 
 Yo, yo, yo my tapdance sword splash 
 Yo.. my nigga Dix'll leave you whiplashed, feel the cash 
 Pussy worth a key a stash, bloodbath 
 Hard to walk the righteous path 
 Flavor for life into death, this berry tart your ginger 
 Ooh she mad tender, analog surrender 
 Off my motherfuckin' splendor, Jamie Sommers pussy bionic 
 Supersonic, splash you with the Wu-Wear garments

 Bobby, all you ever want is weed, money, music and pussy[Intro: RZA] 
 Hahaha, Digi, yo, yo 
  
 [RZA] 
 When I was young, I slept with a battery on my tongue 
 So when I spit, the impact with the sting of a stun gun 
 At full blast, rock your cradle, fatal razorblades graze you 
 Split you open, stitch you back wit' a staple 
 I'm football head, I put your head 
 Into a brook, all four, your momma wouldn't look at ya'll 
 Gold from the Panama canal, Alabama gal 
 Got me laid up, on my nuts like kapow 
 B-O-B Boy's fast as Bruce Leroy 
 Meet the rap Galactus, blow planets off his axis 
 My Glock is plastic, my dick *sniff* is magic 
 Stretch up the power you like Mr. Fantastic 
  
 [Chorus: Dexter Wiggles] 
 Stop, it's a booby trap 
 Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack? 
 Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, when it comes to this mic device, you get ate 
 Like the gingerbread man tryna cross the lake 
 Or the Winchester, call my white son, Lester Poindexter 
 Tell 'em bring back the black mack, strapped with two extra 
 Clips, where's the natural, words inside the apple 
 Potholes in the street, it cracks the Jeep axle 
 Shrivel your heart to a raisin, shorty star gazing 
 Yeah, he got steeper than dunce, once he start blazing blunts 
 Beef, and get drowned in Hunt's 
 Your flame get toast, your best bet to punt 
 I lounge like a hungry jaguar, into agua 
 Trying to catch a fish that multiply like the magua 
 Pocket fat like Jabba the Hutt, Clan gallops up 
 Feel the force of my steel, but you can't count the caliber 
 Digi, Digi, Digi, all inside your city 
 Microphone on the roam, like Capone and Frank Nitty 
  
 [Chorus: Dexter Wiggles] 
 Stop, it's a booby trap 
 Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack? 
 Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap 
 Stop, it's a booby trap 
 Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack? 
 Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap, yo, yo 
  
 [RZA] 
 I don't got a taste for blood or flesh skin 
 My mind, like Professor X from the X-Men 
 One line, cause MC's to write their albums down 
 Devils only come amongst you, if you allow them now 
 Due to trading, they infiltrate with persuasion 
 That desire to rob and steel and make slaves of all 
 Living luxury, destructively, conductively 
 Improper nature, privately and publicly 
 Man so stupid when confronted by something he don't 
 Understand, he shoot it, the whole world's polluted 
 My earth gave birth to a universal change us 
 Scribes reflect the child born in the Bethlehem manger 
 Devils try to steal me of my intellect, rob me of my culture 
 Like they whitewashing sculptures 
 Like they snatching down my posters 
 But it's been caught through the eyes of Minolta 
  
 [Chorus: Dexter Wiggles] 
 Stop, it's a booby trap 
 Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack? 
 Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap 
 Stop, it's a booby trap 
 Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack? 
 Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap, yo, yo[Intro: RZA] 
 *whistling* 
 *beat kicks in* 
 Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Digital 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, I beat the case, now I face the acquittal 
 You nizzles try to belittle, but ya'll lest in spittle 
 From a baby's lip, the digi made me flip 
 Plus they paid me chips, just to spray the clip 
 And empty out on you, in sync like the SMPTE output on the MPC 2002 
 We be housin' crews, plus we housin' fools 
 In abandoned apartments with a thousand tools 
 Crazy shootin' dudes buck off the beat 
 Brainless boutless fools who be stuck off the leaf 
 Two guns in their hands yellin' "Fuck the police!" 
 On the weekend get drunk and they fuck with the niece 
 Of the precint chief, she got the tattoo 
 On her breast that's shaped like The W 
 Go 'head snatch the guns, son, I'll cover you 
 And if they get past me we got another two, yeah... 
  
 [Hook: RZA & Prodigal Sunn] 
 We smoke those blunts the size of bats 
 We got those gats as long as ax 
 We snatch that cheese right off the trap 
 We put those Beez all on your map 
  
 [Prodigal Sunn] 
 I shoot the fair one, I dare ya'll run through New York City 
 Or any city or place, my face, royal taste, pace myself 
 Ace my health, great with wealth 
 Undetected like the wings of a Stealth, I move for self 
 Or any man, woman or child that I call fam 
 That's the way I am, word to Glock, my sister Pam 
 Son, lived through the terror of the World Trade blues 
 Nine o'clock news, abused the mind of many fools 
 Braves and jewels, made my moves, paid my dues 
 From the School of Intelligence, I stayed benevolent 
 Most high, magnify, multiply, as I add to the Kings of Kings 
 We never die, built my name, sustained like blood 
 Flow through the veins divine sign 
 Dine with wine forever sunshine 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 We smoke... 
  
 [Masta Killa] 
 From the Vil to Brazil, live on your C-SPAN radio band 
 Explicit, dice kiss it, pour a little liquor 
 Golden imported from Cuba, Miss Aruba 
 Sexy as Asia, met her up in Mecca 
 Getting up in Just Cipher, hit it on the first date 
 Plotted my escape, twelve hours shift at the gate 
 How can you beat a G a week in '88? 
 Trips to the Pocono Lodge, the fresh Izod 
 Mama shouldn't work so hard to pay the landlord 
 A grand in your birthday card, times is hard 
 The gun hammer click, when the pigs blitz 
 We scramble like Vick, automatic six plus one to the head 
 Yo, the east so hot, it's red, but that's home 
 And my Glock still burn your skin to the bone 
 Sonny Corleone don't discuss it on the phone 
  
 [Hook to end]Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up 
  
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
  
 The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes 
 While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes 
 Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up 
 A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up 
  
 Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up 
 My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up 
 And cops flood the block, no way to eat 
 So I dropped a half a G 
  
 On a rented SP-1200 Sampler and a Yamaha Four-Track 
 The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back 
 While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up 
 Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up 
  
 Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up 
 Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck 
 When I was stressed I would head to the rest 
 Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed 
  
 Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat 
 In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP 
 We went platinum, whoo-peesh, yeah, we flatten 'em 
 Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em 
  
 Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em 
 All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em 
 You can't stop us, you can't block us, rock us or mock us 
 Knock us or top us, better sit back and watch us 
  
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
  
 Can't stop me, man 
 No matter how hard, you better go hard 
 So hard, if you gon' try and stop me now 
 I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild 
 Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down 
  
 Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride 
 Without a homicide, case and trial 
 It's a long time comin', long nines bustin' 
 Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin' 
  
 Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin' 
 The shit that I been through, things that I've seen 
 The chicks that I ran through, places that I've been 
 I'm a victim of the very song I sing 
  
 That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it 
 Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics 
 I'ma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is 
 Either you pay with your life or you pay dues and homage 
  
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now[Hook: Thea] 
 Creep, creep, creep 
 Catch them while they sleep 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
  
 [Crisis] 
 These streets that we maneuver through 
 Ain't nothing  you familiar too 
 Don't talk it out, noodle you 
 Walk it out at your funeral 
 Cold blooded, black hearted, Black Knight and Black Ballin' 
 Black Christmas 
 Be all in your crib with my killas calling 
 Even if you ain't sleepin', 
 We creepin', it ain't no secret 
 Delete you with big toast, that roast you when it heat ya 
 Off whiskey 
 Pop up and bong that ass like Bob Digi 
 Crisis the Sharpshooter 
 I'mma lay 'em down gently 
 One shot, guns pop, in the streets of Camelot 
 That's why some keep they shit on safety 
 Others keep they hammers cocked 
 Ready to blow 
 Ready to go, fire in the hole 
 And if a nigga ready to retire 
 We retiring his soul

 Aiyo 
 I woke up hungry every day 
 (every day)(everyday) 
 Til I learn to do the hustle 
 Every which and every way 
 (every way)(every way) 
 The Compton niggas hit the Chevy wit the K 
 In the candy apple trey 
 Shit gets heavy in L.A 
 (In LA) 
 When Twack died-Mack cried- 
 Bushwick start banging again 
 Then he did a back slide 
 (Backslide) 
 I was in tune wit the sun, star, moon 
 Eddie shot up thirty niggas, in the bar, over June 
 The city's full of Crips(full of Crips) 
 AK's, four-fives, mac-11's, full of clips 
 (Long Beach) 
 Young hogs wit they pockets full of chips 
 If any, not many, academic scholarships 
  
 [Doc Doom] 
 Pulp Fiction, 
 Driving in your car without permission 
 With a video vixen, 
 Giving me head like Bill Clinton 
 Got a drug addiction 
 Pop pills with no prescription 
 Stuck in the rehab, the only man with bad intentions 
 Truly 
 I'm the one the West is really missing 
 Your shit is garbo', I kill you off with one sentence 
 The rap apprentice 
 With a little sack of new inventions 
 Don't listen 
 And I Jimmy off your head like a Henchman

 Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze 
 Make them Swiss cheese 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
  
 [RZA] 
 You wanna feel the heat? 
 I pull the flame out 
 Make a wish, boy 
 Blow your brains out 
 Watch me step out the cribby 
 With the heavy chain out 
 Leaving blood on your shirt, you can't get the stain out 
 In a big body truck, my hair, knotty as a fuck 
 Shotty tucked under the seat, plus a hottie in the truck 
 Get these wizes, get these digits 
 Get my ninjas back in business 
 All you suckas, get the scissors 
 You don't work like you broke and keep AK's like I'm Oakland 
 I be 
 Making that dough, like the Pillsbury Doughman 
 Bobby 
 Covered in ice, like it's Frosty the Snowman 
 You suckas is useless like old New York tokens 
 Front on the Bobby D, watch how your body bleed 
 You ain't worth the weight 
 Of a grain, from a poppy seed 
 Make your brain rupture, decompose your frame structure 
 MC's tremble 
 When they hear the name of us 
 Puffin' Eastwood stogies, 
 Swinging Tiger Woods bogeys 
 The mic is my co-d, the pen is a parolee 
 No jail cell can hold me, Zodiac can't describe me 
 King Tech scratch the beat, 
 Like he caught poison ivy 
  
 [RuggedMonk] 
 Compton's where you can find me!!! 
 In the hood, so grimy 
 Run laps on these tracks, it's a fact 
 You can time me 
 ---READY--- 
 Set, go, I let the, tech blow 
 Rugged Monk 
 Kill a track, at any tempo 
 It's simple 
 We Usually Take All Niggas Garments 
 Spot rush them busters, blockade they apartment 
 It's over, foreclosure 
 Your shit is shut down 
 Creep when you sleep 
 And squeeze the four pound

 Four Shellies 
 What, What, What 
  
 Four shellies rip through his belly 
 Blast him right outside of Mike's deli 
 Dip to the telly 
 Call my bird up on the celly 
  
 Bobby what Bobby lust I walk strange 
 And talk strange 
 Long range sniper aims 
 Swiss cheese your brain 
 I don't sleep 
 And don't eat meat 
 Rest twice a week 
 Speak without moving my lips 
 Got fifty pairs of sneaks 
 Fingerprint proof rubber grips 
 Hollow tip clips 
 Eight ounce sip bud nips 
 We crack barbecue chips 
 And clock a bird off the block 
 Straight away from a flock 
 Just caught me at the bus stop 
 Twist the Snapple top 
 Off, pierced her breast 
 Kept her hair processed 
 No panties underneath the dress 
 Wally ankle bracelet 
 Polo frames 
 Her shades had no name 
 Popocane 
 I slowed my game 
 Thick gold chains 
 Make your eyes flame 
 Up against the Bodega gate 
 She stay straight 
 Perfect figure eight 
 Shape, couldn't wait 
 To bust her grape 
 With the applehead 
 Legs spread open 
 Invincible body armor 
 My scarlet blade will slice the leg 
 From the Shaolin llama

 Yo, 2001 summer heat 
 Icy hot, play the street 
 Twelve month, seven day a week 
 Cat in eye, we hit 
 Blunts hard 
 Fuck birds hard 
 Bitch slap retards 
 Quick fast 
 Wind up in mass 
 Body cast, its like 
 Don't start shit 
 Won't be shit 
 Allah quick to spot shit 
 Smash hit 
 You know the name kid 
 Don't splash it 
 Pop a joint and blast it 
 The shit sound 
 Hype in your whip 
 Make you take the car and crash it 
 Megagraphical 
 Always speak actual 
 Only deal with natural 
 One hundred percent 
 Five percent 
 Militant in aim 
 With the intent 
 Beretta Nine, blast mine 
 On some empty the clip[Hook: Danny Keyz] 
 It's been a long time coming.. 
 Days, days are turning to nights now 
 They said... they said I'd be okay 
 But when I hear those church bells ringing 
 I begin to pray for today might be my dying day 
  
 [RZA] 
 The great mind, surpass space and time 
 Seven plains of energy, interlace combine 
 Five conscious stages, stand up courageous 
 Change your polarity, seek mental clarity 
 Ziplock off the chronic, kissed it, then I twist it 
 Build on today's mathematic ballistics 
 I walk with the utmost honorable respect 
 It's a quick locked secret, so Protect Ya Neck 
 This is full metal jacket, ain't about that gossip 
 Nope, you get your face all over the Bossip 
 Go out the closet, you slimey sausage 
 Six degrees of luxury, with no deposi 
 They said a ? beats a ? 
 A plane beats a tank 
 A gat beats a shank 
 Look, I just hit jackpot, a hundred mil to the bank 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 The continent splitter, the dominant figure 
 The mathematician who calculated God from nigga 
 The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga 
 My vigorous attack on the track, slice a thousand giga 
 Bytes of information, in one line, how sometime 
 Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine 
 Nine concubines and nine wives, nine lives 
 Nine clans sit on my side, we carry nine knives 
 Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man 
 Can withstand the blow, from the Wu-Tang Clan 
 I answer many questions of life, without asking 
 Breath in the stench of death, without gasping 
 Fasting and praying, while you laughing and playing 
 I am fast in my mind, to attachment what we came in 
 And go through the river of life, I stay floating 
 Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 I have no fascination with Satan, no relation to probation 
 I'm the sun sitting still, while you trapped in rotation 
 Every rebel's creation, every thought is innovation 
 One demonstration, we civilized a whole entire nation 
 Attract a generation, who's built with elimination 
 Of wickedness and sickness, we striving for the bliss 
 We rising up our fists, five stage of consciousness 
 Keeping our promises, master our circumference 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro: RZA] 
 Yeah, I'm back 
 Sometimes, you think you bout to lose it all 
 But it's actually, the point that you made it all 
 It seems like life is gonna pass me by 
 But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity 
 A life has just begun... 
 And if we having a good time, but wasting your time 
 Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine 
 And all praises due to the Most High... 
 I'm here forever!Intro: [Bobby (Beretta 9)]

 I'm paranoid of loiZOID 
 We fight like Guiver against the hyperZOID NOIDS 
 HIGH ACHIEVER mind computes like Achieva 
 Thoguhts connect like the quarterback to the wide receiver 
 Stay blunted drinking Coqui 900 
 Never fronting on my niggas on the battle zone 
 Thoughts flip before they change your whips on the 
 Good ship Jesus before Khemet was called Egypt 
 Before the Bloods and Crips Tomahawks and pimps. 18 Puma Spades we still had balds and braids 
 Amplify the sound of the earth rotation 
 Who could pin-point the exact location in space 
 It's to see hear and feel the earth rotation 
 That's why knowledge is the basic foundation of 
 All things and creation, like man is the foundation of 
 His family and the sun's the foundation of the solar system 
 Wisdom is the manifestation when words and actions are put 
 Into activation escape this captivation niggas busting 
 Wasting shots like masturbation transforming like gobots 
 They created a race of robots our new rulers are 
 Computers Abbott's been known now come through to us 
 Heads drifting in space like asteroids 
 Pass the roids, savages trading places like Dan Akyroid 
 The truth is ignored, these devils must be destroyed 
  
 Chorus: Bobby 
  
 Search for the better things in life 
 Beef wid wife make a nigga live a street life

 Yo, check it out, yo, one two, yo 
 Soon to smooth litigating 
 Camouflage educating 
 Baretta Nines barating 
 Only smoke rounds a day and 
 Ain't nothing to overdo the shit 
 Ya'll niggas best to come up quick 
 We gonna start and finish it 
 Cause I'm sure watch me murder it 
 Undersiege fatigue get bat at major league 
 Nine industry forms that be forced from catigues 
 We live righteous TC they go up do the same 
 Fuck the fame we hear the bill better keep your 
 Eyes peeled fuck around get killed it ain't safe no 
 Fucking more C-Ciphers at my door and I got more 
 Than one war, I'm gonna stay on my toes and do the one 
 To two timers, we gon' make this year our year to 
 Beware peace to rhymers our life is in a bond-a 
 Sware we gotta find a, way out we took the crypt ride 
 We all about, on these streets trying to make ends meet 
 Stay on my feet gotta eat God you things is deep peep 
 The sleep, How you see camouflage these cats 
 We on that bullshit, last days thinkings of snakes 
 And either pull it soft you know like an afro 
 Other cats sit like Castro I murder that snitch ass 
 Donnie Brasco, We dissatisfied of your devils 
 Running running high, my mind and my physical be unified 
 To the day we testify we wanna be penalised 
 Form God Allah motherfuckers best recognise 
  
 Chorus: RZA 
  
 A bag of dast mixed wid stress 
 Search for the better things in life 
 Beef wit wife make a nigga wanna live a street life 
 We smoke blunts, duck Jakes, pay rent, stay bent 
 Attend wakes, baby make 
 Search for better things in life 
 Beef wit wife, make a nigga wanna live a street life

 Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, I'm not reneggin' 
 I don't fuck with dead pigeons or the pigskin 
 You fuckin' fake 85% snake 
 Derelict ass bitch, your class in dead weight 
 Ain't no fire escape from hell, every devil ain't pale 
 I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds" 
 Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall 
 Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I'm just hurlin' ya'll 
 Lightnin' bolts ---- by writin' quotes 
 Strikin' jolts that frightenin' to adults 
 A to Zig-Zag you get smacked, all in a shitbag 
 Flushed like the spermbag, because your germ had 
 You on some ol' fake thug shit 
 Drunk from the drink, gassed up by the drug shit 
 Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis 
 While the Gods rebuildin' Jerusalem, golden palaces 
 Babes in Wonderland wonderin' where the fuck Alice is 
 While you're jerkin' your dick catchin' mad callouses 
 Slave labor steel drivin' like John Henry 
 Layin' down underground tracks for nine pennies 
  
 [Masta Killa] 
 Huh, get you amped off the anthem 
 Yeah, I get you amped off the uh... 
 Yeah, look, another smash hit 
 My niggas from the Boulevard 
 East New York Squad in the yard gettin' ripped, at least 25 a clip 
 A 100 men stompin' your face, the wolves barkin' 
 Careful, you might get trampled, caught flashin' 
 Wrap him in the maskin' tape, Jimmy Baskin 
 Murder was the case when the crowd break fool 
 Iron Mic Duel, held down by the poolside 
 Along came a spider spun spools in the cipher 
 Swing with all your might, lead spray from the sawed-off pipe 
 Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang 
 Flow like water off the brim in the rain 
 No escapin', Iron Maiden, check matin' 
 Grandmaster Flash spinnin, P.F. cuttin' 
 The sticky Afgooey, rolled in the fronto leaf 
 Jamel Irief smash teef in beef 
  
 [Tash Mahagony] 
 Some people lyrics ain't hot 
 My delivery is ill on the mic and I rock 
 So hot, this stage should be a stainless steel pot 
 Leavin' burnin' pains Neosporin couldn't stop 
 On cats who couldn't rock 
 Would shook cause I drop 'em 
 Fear is a probelm in this game if you got 'em 
 My mic I carry the heat for rappers playin' possum 
 'Fraid that I'm a see 'em, spit a rhyme, lyrically drop 'em 
 Just to say I got 'em, but it's realer than that 
 I'm about more that what you see and what I speak in my rap 
 So be conscious of that 
 Grand told you, "Watch the quiet ones, you didn't get it?" 
 You think that you could rip a chick who spit her lyrics 
 Pretty rhymes so tight my lyrics did it 
 Got you open and it worked it and you won't admit it 
 Hopin' that we both forget it 
 These ain't no one night stand lyrics, I'm never really finished 
 Got you duckin', tryin' to pivot, beware 
 Next time, come wit' it 
  
 "Koto... Chotan..."[Hook: sample] 
 I come for darkness, and lightness will appear 
 And you got to disappear, through this chamber of fear 
  
 [Rev. William Burke] 
 Yo, aiyo, the 36 Chambers of vigorous training 
 Pinpoint aiming, arrigorous paining 
 Swordplay, villanous blood staining 
 Meditation, grace and mind elevation 
 To trigger the thought, the law of the court 
 Be the love of the sport, and it can't be bought 
 Once taught, the hidden Chi secret style art 
 To use it, to get to the top and not part 
 I sought, a means of escape from the darkness 
 And how much energy will victory cost us 
 12 Jewelz, and the Gods move cautious 
 Twelve fools, had attempted to flaw with us 
 But we pop shots at 'em, like jump shots 
 Three hundred and sixty degrees, cause we lunch box 
 With more kung fu chops than Ong Bak 
 One drop, of Wu blood'll make it hot to the last drop 
  
 [RZA] 
 I suppose you know, you can't oppose the chosen one 
 My cold mental chill will leave Phoenix with a frozen sun 
 Gravities being shot from a golden gun 
 No defending my lane, boy, no holding, son 
 Just submit, my crown is undefeatable 
 So bow down to the dragon, that's unbeatable 
 Programming my thoughts, that's undeletable 
 You'll imagine me achieving the inconcivable 
 Shake opponents, the God is unbreakable 
 Try to steal the moment, but you dogs are incapable 
 Trials and tribulations, and fouled the stipulation 
 My word articulation, will uplift the nation 
 You can bet, I'm a triple threat 
 Whether assisting, defending or swishing through the net 
 Dot world wide web, I'm a world wide celeb 
 Bobby got Bush like George and Jeb 
 King pioneer, travel with the Cavaliers 
 Step inside the square, if you dare wanna battle here 
  
 [Hook 2X] 
  
 [Rev. William Burke] 
 Preach prophet, drop God body logic 
 Whose squadron invincible, and devils can't stop it 
 We cosmic comets from the lands of the tropics 
 Who see through third eye optics, like cockpits 
  
 [RZA] 
 Against all odds, and against all squads 
 We defending the yard, with the strength of the God 
 And stand and deliver, face the man in the mirror 
 And abandon our fears, without a blam or a shiver 
 If I give my word, then I plan to deliver 
 Expand my whole Clan, over land and the rivers 
 You'll receive from the giver, understand and consider 
 Don't fall to the fear, you should stand as a pillar

 [Verse 1: La the Darkman] 
 Yo; Niggas is feeble, I'm calm but violent like Ben Siegel 
 I'm anti-evil, plus I touch a desert eagle 
 My life's illegal, slave man princess' is equal 
 The devil's lethal, he killed a hundred million people 
 I'm Darkman, Iceman, La, Wu-Tang Clan 
 Trapacanty, sensei, ¿comprendé? 
 My marine corps, straight from the Trojan war 
 Black-capped crusader, trapped off, flame thrower 
 Stuck a chain store when I was dirt poor for my reward 
 Next week the Germans have me on a bulletin board 
 I beat that case, they couldn't identify my face 
 I'm triple darkness, silence or I'll have you erased 
 Me and my Wu pirates start riots with Osiris 
 Math, I apply it, kill you, but I'm quiet 
 Respect the Abbott, it's Love Allah 
 Shine like a superstar, sting with the cobra claw, what? 
  
 [Chorus x8: La the Darkaman & Wu-Tang Clan] 
 Wu World Order 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo; I enter through the chamber of your ear 
 In a high-pitched silent tone only a dog could hear 
 And impregnate you, with the wisdom of the Wu 
 Then your subconscious dreams come constantly true 
 Have you in such deep thought 
 Your pulse and blood pressure's so low 
 You diagnosed as corpse 
 Having outer body experience, Clan no interference 
 Everything with physical form, lose appearance 
 We become one with the formulas, now you feel the strongest 
 Escape, trample lies, you live for the longest 
 Live a thousand years in a day 
 Without opening your mouth you say 
 Everything you wanted to say 
 Attract to the call of the earth, I stay grounded 
 The sun in the center of this, I'm surrounded 
 My planets in midst, I spins, the windchill 
 But my light melts your snowflake from ninety-three mil' 
 All who have the ear, let 'em here as we reveal 
 'Cause one ear of corn can produce a cornfield 
 And one cornfield can produce the corn mill 
 The bread from the body of Christ, on this field 
 With the truth of life inside your bone marrow 
 You could make your physical as large as your shadow 
 Whether space or cyborg, optic is fiber 
 Become a pawn, multimedia subscriber 
 And hibernate, the Wu tape in your mental state 
 Let it meditate, sit back and await 
 The orders, for this you don't need no tape recorder 
 So let's prepare for the Wu World Order 
  
 [Chorus x8: La the Darkaman & Wu-Tang Clan] 
 Wu World Order

 We coming soon and we striking at your borders[Intro: Sly Stone] 
 Afro Samurai... 
 Blood... 
  
 [Chorus: Dionna Nichelle] 
 It's a family affair 
 It's a family affair 
  
 [RZA] 
 Blood, is thicker than mud 
 Even gangstas and thugs'll prove family love 
 It's a family affair, no calamity there 
 It's humanity share, who's the rightful heir 
  
 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 With sword style so retarded, it leave enemies 
 Dearly departed, and we nearly cold hearted 
 But, down for the fam, mad rivers of blood 
 It started pouring on land, this be a warrior's clan 
 Without a friend in the world, they find you in the end 
 But I'm loving my girl, cause she fight for the win 
 Will sport a sinister grin, when blowing smoke in the wind 
 Committing menacing sins, all in the name of the kin 
 With pinpoint precision and a 'fro's that's wild 
 Cold razor sharp style again, we killing them down 
 Stay defending on ten, never depending on men 
 Living the samurai code from a hundred on in 
  
 [Chorus 2X w/ Sly Stone ad-libs] 
  
 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 Will keep blades even sharper than Hattori Hanzo 
 And be the last man standing after the last blow 
 Slice with one swipe and like a shovel, the gensu 
 And swarm like the Wu, when the planet come blitz you 
 A wise samurai who's alibi is this high 
 Humble as a butterfly, but a killer inside 
 Strong family ties, will keep equality prize 
 Solidy rise, to each other, honestly we can fight 
 In tune on the attack, platoon up in the back 
 With room, taking no slack, we zoom in the format 
 Typhoons, kabooms, and full moons when we combat 
 Killas for contract, with ninjas and all that 
 And if you ain't family, we barely gon' interact 
 Love is for kin folk, a bond is a killer's pack 
 We strike too quickly for the enemies to react 
 Blood thick as mud, and a heart is a road map 
  
 [Chorus 2X w/ Sly Stone ad-libs] 
  
 [Sly Stone] 
 Oh child, oh child, grows up be 
 Somebody, just a little blood 
 And ah, blood child, grows up to be 
 The one who just loves blood 
 My love, supposed to build, see it's in the blood 
 Refuse to love, blood's thicker than mud, just stand that 
  
 [Chorus 2X w/ Sly Stone ad-libs][Intro: ShaCronz] 
 Yeah, uh, it's dark outside 
 We still in the hood with this one, ya'll 
 Yeah, from the projects, slums, Fort Greene 
 Huh? Ain't no sun outside, never sunny where I'm from 
 Always grimy, yo, yo, yo, yo 
  
 [ShaCronz] 
 Everyday is a struggle, but you can catch my team hustlin' till the late night 
 Takin' risks, playin' dice, screamin' "We hate life!" 
 Gettin' this money, but we want more 
 I see a lot of niggas beefin', but they don't want war 
 I heat targets, anything you see, rob it, got beef like the meat market 
 I'm clappin' captains, lieutenants, and police sergeants 
 I got two hoes named Denise and Margaret 
 They come through and finish drama after we start it 
 All my chicks major, I rep N.Y. like a Knick player 
 Get paper, split haters, I still spit and shit razors 
 Got eight pair of sick 'gators, five watches 
 Switch flavors, 50 red and blue rocks around the wrist, player 
 My vision is deep the Division will creep 
 Run up on you, start hittin' your peeps 
 Nigga, we ain't playin, our mission's discreet 
 I'm clippin' your peeps, have you missin' for weeks 
 To let you know we ain't playin' 
  
 [RZA] 
 Olive oil and fried tomatoes and basil 
 I stepped in flared nasal from Hazelnut Amaretto 
 My watch 80 G appraisal 
 Plus they drop 50 G's for a RZA beat 
 Cherry wood, hickory seats, presidential suites 
 Ice cold bottles of Cristy 'til my eyes misty 
 Complainin' to my lawyer how this rookie tried to frisk me 
 Jealous of my jeep, I gave his badge to the chief 
 And got his ass directin' traffic in the heat for a week 
  
 [Freemurda] 
 Keep comin' out your gums like loose teeth 
 You gon take 40 to the mouth and it ain't no brewski 
 That monitor gonna show straight lines like looseleaf 
 Got Up North niggas straight out the box like Loosies 
 Wanna shoot me? know you get a kick out of that just like Bruce Lee 
 Ya'll don't wanna lose teeth 
 Comin' all out of your face just like pimples 
 That thing comin' out of my waist, gotta hit you 
 'Cuz ya'll niggas ain't with it, better quit it 
 'Til you catch one through that man dribblin' on your fitted 
 That mean one through the front, through the back of the cap 
 Like the great Pun packin' a Mac in the back of the Ac' 
 You could take one, not talkin' bout a Ac' 
 I get cake from the fat crack bag with them packs, what? 
  
 [Allah Real] 
 Wherever I go, I pack my 44 
 Wherever I go, I always have dough 
  
 [Outro: Daddy-O (RZA)] 
 Yo, peace, yo, Bobby! What up?

 Yo, God, it's the new way of life, knowhatimsayin? It's the truth

 Youknowhatimsayin, Supreme Mathematics, youknowhatimsayin 
 Check this out, and let me know... (let's see what you talkin' about) 
 Youknowhatimsayin, I know you'll respond good 
 This could take you to another level 
 (Now hold on, man, you an O.G., you trynna tell me you trynna read, man, nigga?) 
 Listen, brother, I've been readin', man, without this man I wouldn't be here right now 
 You know? (You know what, god? Youknowhatimean? 
 I'mma trust your word on this, I'mma pick this up, I'mma read this, aight 
 I'mma get back at you, if I can relate, we'll relate 
 If not, you still gonna have those pounds for me though, right?!?) 
 Yeah, no doubt, but yo, right now, these the pounds right here, g 
 This is Math right here (yeah, it's like that, for real, fam?) 
 For real (aight) aight, peace (Peace fam) 
 This nigga, talkin' peace, man, this nigga's the wildest' nigga I know, yo![Kung fu sample] 
 Now, it's the master's turn though 
 I'm betting in, well there's a show here 
  
 [Intro: RZA] 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step.. 
 Yo, yo, yo 
  
 [RZA] 
 We take your wizzes away, like we be called on 
 Deep in space like the Millennium Falcon 
 Ya'll be fools, scored like ancient Babylon 
 Rabbits and turtles, all run the marathon 
 Yup, ya'll paper chasing, ya'll human racing 
 Who got the best basement? 
 You got a 6SL, I got a SSL 
 I score movies, make Supreme Clientele 
  
 [Hook: Thea Van Seijen (RZA)] 
 Oh, here I am (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 No, can't get it near, I quit (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 All day, all night, what brings to you life 
 For you in the world (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City Crack) 
  
 [RZA] 
 Silly rabbits, trynna disrespect The Abbott 
 Don't you know that we'll turn your cold body to maggots 
 I got forty million records sold, some platinum, some gold 
 Some we just put out to meet the tax code 
 Your career will be shorter than the 21st of December 
 Be one of those thousand rappers no one remembers 
 While my name is carved on trophies, colleges recite my bars 
 You can look up, and see my name up on the stars 
 And when it comes down to that basic talent 
 I got 20 little cousins that can meet your challenge 
 Yo, stop and listen, and check this proposition 
 Son, got lots of vision, plus lots of wisdom 
 Hindsight, foresight, insight, out of sight 
 Some try to imitate, but they are not alike 
 They only piggy back, have a Digi Snack 
 That Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Kung fu sample] 
 We're just dealing, of a man 
 Tough take before you 
 A cryptic to your power 
 The reason why we slept and spared your son's life 
 Was to give you faith 
 Thank you, man, thank you 
 You fight well, the hand must reach to the sky 
 Save the best for me, and have perfect breathing 
 Good breath control, you know of these 
  
 [Hook][Skit: RZA] 
 The ol' abbot 'n shit, y'knahmean? 
 You gotta sit still, after a while, knahmsayin? 
 But as long as he keep the fire burnin 
 Any spark, he can he can touch another fire 
 He can spark another person, another person 
 That's why you see in the kung-fu flicks 
 You see the abbot, you know 
 That he don't come back to fight the villain 
 He get a student, he train a student for that job[Intro: RZA] 
 I wanna dedicate this song to the young god, Kareem 
 The Genius... Digi... 
 Say it to 'em roof angel 
  
 [Hook: Thea] 
 Learn to keep my head up to the sky 
 And ask myself why, it has to be this way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And health, not to worry about 
 All the dramas of the day 
  
 As we strive for luxury 
 And try to feed our families 
 It always seems that someone's in your way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And health, not to worry about 
 All the dramas of the day 
  
 [RZA] (Monk) 
 I met a young brother, about 28 
 Who seemed intelligent and rather quite straight 
  
 I greeted him, and struck up conversation 
 To see if the youngster had some self motivation 
  
 Peace brother, whats your name? How you be? 
 (I'm Rugged Monk and I'm all about the currency) 
  
 [Monk] (RZA) 
 (You mean gettin' paid?) 
  
 Yeah like my man's brother 
 Who has a condo, he shares with his baby mother 
  
 You know a condo beats my apartment 
 With no lights, no gas and backed up rent 
  
 No hot water or heat, infested with plenty rats 
 That'll eat up the average alley cat 
  
 (I'm like damn, homey, thats poverty) 
 (He's like) Word O.G. that bothers me 
  
 Plus I'm about to be a new father, G 
 (We need to wise up and change the hood policy) 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] (Monk) {both} 
 Yo, why you fear the devil, as a grown man? 
 Why you not out there trying to make your own plan? 
  
 See we are a victim, of a situation 
 Where a wicked man, separated the nation 
  
 And got us killin' off one another 
 Black on black, they pit brother on brother 
  
 It's gettin' hot, hotter than July 
 See the murder and crime rate is risin' to the sky 
  
 (For example, in my neighborhood it's so hot 
 I'm often woke up, from the alarming sounding of a shot) 
  
 (So I'm thinking what), Is your neighborhood a trap? 
 {Could this be the place marked X on the map?} 
  
 (And I'm spotted like a target in a shooting gallery 
 So I strive to seek for a better salary 
  
 So I can escape from where? From this ghetto life area 
 {Cuz everyday it gets scarier} 
  
 [Hook]Hahahahahaha, we gon' do what we do right here, baby 
 You already know what it is, Division, back in the building 
 Brooklyn, you see 'em? Haha (yeah, come on) {soldier hold ya sword high} 
 {Swing it like a Samurai} Who are we? 
  
 We the breadwinners, baby, make it peel, sippin' blunts 
 Smokin' guns, taught M.C.'s how these niggas living 
 Earn, burning word for ya, curb serving 
 Got you hooked by the first purchase, birds chirping 
 Cops listening, with the gun sitting on they lap 
 Cuz of that, the t-shirt's on the block, like 'stop snitching' 
 Living by the code of the samurai 
 Dreams put on hold like operators standing by 
 What you craft with your heart or your weapon 
 It's a question, what you craft with, a Glock or a message in a rhyme 
 I teach you little savage part of a lesson and choice 
 Between being a gangsta and an artist, is the start of your ending 
 You can front like you a gangsta artist, but that ain't the smartest 
 Decision, niggas'll test you 
 Say you ain't the hardest, regardless, what you spare homey 
 RZA told me that the game is flipping, nobody bent for me 
  
 Haha, you already know what it is 
 Murda is back in the building 
 Division, back in the building 
  
 Free Murda dick longer than the O.J. trial 
 Have your bitch backstage with the Colgate smile 
 I'm on the back Glocks where the coke ring loud 
 Bullets got flat tops like they stole Kane's style 
 Warm 'em kid, you wanna flow, drain now 
 Get your whole brain out, where your hoes hang out 
 It's killing me, everybody got cocaine nail 
 Stealing Free is like trying take a old stain out 
 Your boy's on fire, my boat stays out 
 It's gon' take more than a wire, to close they mouth 
 Got a slice of that bread, bags that you stole 
 You had a price on your head, now that tag's on your toe 
 And you know that nigga dead when the casket is closed 
 Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes 
 I'm trying, real good, the semi' got loud up 
 You can die in your hood, like Kenny from South Park 
  
 How many licks does it take 
 For me to hit the tootsie roll center of a break? 
 Yeah, how many hits must you make 
 Before a man'll get his mule and his forty ac's 
  
 Soldier hold your sword high... 
 Swing it like a Samurai... 
 Now don't get all out of pride... 
 From the Afro Samurai...[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap] 
 You ain't sayin' nothing slick to a can of oil 
 Tell your man to tell his man that his man's a girl 
 I holds weight, ya'll niggas skinny like Olive Oil 
 We throws atleast half a ki' in the pot to boil 
 Royal niggas, rags to riches 
 Because your boy breaks bitches like glasses, dishes 
 Burn money like I put it in some grass and spliffed it 
 If I don't get my man that's passed, it's not misses 
 Female donkeys, ya'll niggas ass and dickless 
 Hard white rap, just some foil like chiclets 
 Never had a wife, you better settle for the mistress 
 The truth like Al Capone dying for the syphlis 
 Cross me, you name flying on the hit list 
 Ya'll niggas buck, won't even pop a clutch on the gear shift 
 That ain't the hard pose, nigga, you just scared stiff 
 I'm on my grizzly, you might walk right into bear shit 
 You rock your pants too tight, get off that queer shit 
 No turning back when it's on, I ain't trynna hear shit 
 Like the coast guard, I got them choppers than can airlift 
  
 [Bridge: Tash Mahogany] 
 Sword, dont you know what you bring? 
 You destroy everything - all the blood that you give to men 
 There's, no excuse I could give - we just all want to live 
 All the war that you bring to men 
  
 [Hook: Tash Mahogany] 
 War - is comin' home - takes families 
 War - I'm not a great big fan of it 
 War - is something that is scandalous 
 Oh no - oh no 
 War - is comin' by air, land, & sea 
 War - is man's insanity 
 This world.. for sure.. 
 Must stop - this world of war 
  
 [Verse 2: Ghostface Killah] 
 Tell ya fake niggas don't get me involved, my back is chunky 
 Four-five hanging out the jeans, is crunchy 
 Facial hair beard, looking like Abe Lincoln 
 Stand next to you and my jewels look like ya cage is shrinking 
 Love sweets like a dope fiend, nodder wit fat hands 
 Keep birds around me, they be calling me Batman 
 Precisely I pop like cheap luggage, prefusely bleeding 
 Word on the streets is you lost three buckets 
 Fuck it, you keep dying, I'm into red diamonds 
 Rob me, bitch, I have your whole hood crying 
 Lighting candles on the street like, 'why you trying?' 
 Oh lord, why you had to lullabye him 
 His jewels is cursed, his seeds is first 
 When he do shows, he pop a wheelie off his murst 
 Six three, medium built, tall like Lurch 
 While ya'll faggots be sleep, he be putting in work 
  
 [Verse 3: RZA] 
 That's his absorbance stance, I got it down to a glance 
 It's war, I got the biggest gun down my pants, pants 
 Got a rock, rocket in my pocket 
 For to knock ya head right out the socket 
 Turn teardrops to smile, been glanced this spare child 
 Spra ya gallon of mace in your face, burn off your 'brows 
 No phone home, you dribbling, we stone ya sibling 
 Get my bloods from Tilden, to burn your building 
 Poison tip dagger sword, chop through your collar bone 
 No, you don't got a fucking chance to holler home 
 Nice dream, your sliced spleen, cut through your ice bling 
 G-O-D, heats, melts you like it's ice cream 
 I'm not vanilla, I'm black panther chinchilla 
 My cousin's an orangutan, my brother's a gorilla 
 The other's a ape, he turn a rainbow straight 
 Get you trapped in the jungle now you can't escape 
 War it is, that's the biz, Glock pop, plops the feds 
 Split your wig, crack your whip, smack your wiz, blast your 'quip 
 Chains and whips, planes and ships, guns, swords and flintstones 
 And bricks, munch, clothes and kicks, you know it's 
  
 [Bridge: Tash Mahogany] 
 Sword, dont you know what you bring? 
 You destroy everything - all the blood that you give to men 
 There's, no excuse I could give - we just all want to live 
 All the war that you bring to men 
  
 [Hook: Tash Mahogany] 
 War - is comin' home - takes families 
 War - I'm not a great big fan of it 
 War - is something that is scandalous 
 Oh no - oh no 
 War - is comin' by air, land, & sea 
 War - is man's insanity 
 This world.. for sure.. 
 Must stop - this world of war[Intro: RZA] 
 Eh-yo, Kinetic 
 What up God? You got that Glock cleaned? 
 Soaked those bullets in oil? 
 So yo, I'mma call the Black Knights up 
 And North Star from down in the Westside 
 Nah mean? 
 Eh-yo, they gon' come and blast this shit over 
 YouknowImean? 
 Think we don't need no Shaolin cats for the job 
 Take it to the Wild Wild West 
 {​*beat kicks in*}​ 
 BOODOODOO.. 
  
 [Intro Pt. II: Crisis (RZA) {​Ms. Roxy}​] 
 Yeah.. (Come on son) 
 The one and only.. sharpshooter.. 
 (Spark these niggas my nigga) 
 Yo I speak to be heard {​Digital}​ 
 The truth shall set you free {​Digital}​ 
 (Set them niggas free God) 
 You in a Chamber, in the Chamber {​Bobby, Bobby, Bobby..}​ 
 (BOODOODOO.. Darkness, you know? Must come to light) 
  
 [Verse 1: Crisis (RZA)] 
 Eh-yo, it's the sharpshooter, one and only, guaranteed 
 I ain't tripping, yo it ain't no comparing me 
 To nothing else, untraceable, like a stealth bomber on your radar 
 There they are, take a look, yo I spit the uncontainable 
 Highly flammable, unexplainable 
 Game Pro - Crisis show you how to tame a ho 
 Show you how the game should go 
 So you lames can know 
 Black Knights equals nothing but dope 
 So what you working with? 
 You bitch niggas ain't hurting shit, spitting commercial shit 
 We rhyme for different purposes 
 I spit for the cause, you spit for the broads 
 I spit for the streets, you spit for the geeks 
 I spit for North Long Beach and all of my peeps 
 Holding it down, I spit for the meak 
 We holding the crown, you savage niggas had your chance 
 So now it's on us, it's just us, you get your bones crushed 
 You got against us, resist us? 
 I thinks not (thinks not), it's impossible {​*echoes*}​ 
  
 [Break: RZA] 
 If you live for the blood, Throw Your Flag Up 
 If you got the love in your heart, Throw Your Flag Up 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Rollie Fingers in the back, son rolled the bag up 
 Street had the pen and the pad, he threw a tag up 
 Uncooked beef in the street, they tagged the rag up 
 Goldie got the clip from the closet and filled the gat up 
 Bobby sharpened the razor, oiled the bat up 
 Let the dogs out the basement, pulled the rap up 
 Somehow the Brown cats about to get clapped up 
 Pussy high nigga off coke tried to act up 
 Against the world's greatest mind, Bob Digital 
 Might throw a Shaolin Hand-block or a fifty-two 
 My young son Big Un don't fuck with Patty Cake 
 Bound to walk through the woods barefoot, choke a rattlesnake 
 While his brother Melchizedeck, dissect it 
 Up in the project life, the street's be hectic 
 The gun burst, son shot his tongue first 
 Shouldn't've shot his tongue first, should've shot the gun first 
 Now chew on the Sunburst, bitch, it's Bobby's day 
 Lyrics for the out, click click, like shottys spray 
 Tear through flesh/bone, get lodged up in your ass cheek 
 Cuz you came talkin' that same bullshit last week 
 Fuckin' cokehead nigga, what? Your brain numb? 
 I used to wonder where these pussy-clats came from 
 Up in the thirty-six cell block I Shadowbox 
 Sip on wheat grass and build up like a male ox 
  
 [Break: RZA (Monk)] 
 If you love for the Glock, +Throw Your Flag Up+ 
 If you got love for the Gods, +Throw Your Flag Up+ 
 If you live from the heart, +Throw Your Flag Up+ 
 Don't cause the beef, I might tie the rag up 
 All my Digihead niggas, roll the bag up 
 BOODOODOODOO.. and +Throw Your Flag Up+ 
 (If you come from Long Beach, +Throw Your Flag Up+ 
 If you come from Compton, throw your rag up 
 If you come from the West then throw your hood up 
 If you come from the block then +Throw Your Flag Up+) 
  
 [Verse 3: Monk] 
 I spit the flavor for the ear, shit for the streets 
 Rollin' in the cutty about five niggas deep 
 One SK, two Tec-9's and two sticks 
 Ready to trip on these fools around my way poppin' shit 
 Like the Black Knights don't air them things out 
 Knuckle up in the spot 'til someone get drops 
 Stomped, get passed out 
 Passed out off a pint of that pah, ready to mic brawl 
 Clean sweep, took the first pitch, knocked the home-run 
 Black Knights known to grab mics, leave the spots full blown 
 You know motto, the +Knights or Nuttin'+, so stop frontin' 
 Like you ain't heard this high pitch through your twelve-inch 
 Kenwoods,  Alpines, I keep those six-by-nines thumpin' 
 +Jumpin' Jumpin'+ like Destiny, I laced it with the Rugged recipe 
 You know my technique on a Ra' beat 
 Speak the Digi slurred speech but aggressive with the mic 
 On mine, it's strictly Black Knights 
 Steal the spotlight, show niggas how to rock mics 
 The right way, spit like a K, M-o-n-k 
 The conqueror, smash your sponsor 
 Learn the lesson from the Black Knight lethal +Silent Weapon+

 Yo, what’s todays Mathematics? 
 Two plus square 
 The truth is the only light 
 Nigga stand by himself 
 In the surrounding of darkness 
 There’ll be no disc shining 
 In the square of the universe 
 Which is 360 degrees 
 When God builds he (?) 
 Perpendicular to a square

 Hate you on a daily 
 Man this shit is crazy 
 It ain't worth what we (?) you

 Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes 
 Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes 
 Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 I love my niggas to death, down to the last breath 
 But the last breath, I'm gonna save for myself 
 You fake snakes 
 Only come around when they need you 
 Savages, biting off the hands that feed you 
 Come among the righteous trying to spread that evil 
 Blinded by the love all these years but now I see you 
 For who you be and what you are to me 
 Tip a ray magnet trying to get a charge off me 
 In the old days, I would give a charge for free 
 But nowaday, I’m charging you $100 g’s 
 Wu-Tang is permanent 
 I’m the illuminated (?) 
 Known to chops heads off at the hip hop tournament

 Hate you on a daily

 [Third Verse: RZA] 
 From a small water cacoon 
 Bent to the shape of a quarter moon 
 A small water pack that’s placed above the womb 
 I was fashioned by Allah’s 
 All men are created equal 
 Then tricked with wicked lies that separated the people 
 Then escaped to (?) 
 (?) 
 Someone tried to shoot Mister Robert Fitzgerald 
 The supreme original intelligent 
 The Prince RZA 
 Somehow mistake me for a old wise wizard 
 I put love up against anything 
 I put love upon the angel wings 
 I put love beyond the diamond rings 
 With true love nothing should come between 
  
 [Hook: Truth Hurts] 
 Hate you on a daily 
 Man this shit is crazy 
 It ain't worth what we (?) you 
 Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy

 [RZA] 
  
 Yeah it's Bobby Digital 
 Just floatin over the city 
 I came across this, this, this black man 
 He was talkin about (look down below) 
  
 Sure of yourself rising, prices of food skyrising 
 Foreign countries movin in USA, enterprising 
 Snatchin your mic then speakin, while you might be leaking 
 Then losin the luxury, average man be seeking 
  
 Thought he was so smart; ho's cheating, life fall apart 
 Fucking a hundred bitches couldn't mend a broken heart 
 Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk 
 Fucked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work 
  
 Nine-to-five, government high taxes 
 Police dispatches, Beauracatics attackin black Asiatics 
 Resident with bad plumbing, Cocaine got my brain numb 
 And bitch complained about cumming, pussy stay humming; 
  
 $200 parking, summons out of state warrants 
 High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence 
 Got me gaining weight, fuckin up my right kidney 
 Cousin raped at school, Eli Whitney 
  
 Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by faux penmanship, with unpaid doctor bills 
 Framed got shot and killed, cops popping pills 
 Three pair cotton, steel closet, cabinet of no frills 
 Mo' bills, sister got evicted from Park Hill 
  
 Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels 
 My dogs bark, still carry dark steel 
 And unmarked bills, I'm from the uncut, dope, found on director's reels 
 Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels 
  
 Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate 
 So hungry, son, 'bout to shrink down to a bird's weight 
 Rash break out, where's the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments 
 Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment 
  
 Better checks don't come late 
 About to separate with her man 
 In the city, domestic violence escalates 
  
 Get a highest ratio in five years, the idea is to plant fear 
 Boy you slap yo' bitch, po-lice is there 
 To cuff you or snuff you, they might bust you 
 Cause your ho snatched your money up, didn't want to fuck you 
  
 We must learn to communicate, and unificate 
 Stop the black on black, hate on hate 
 White on white, black on white, put the love in love 
 I'm blunted up, blasted inside the strip club 
  
 Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love 
 And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro 
 Collect call from my son denial, said he might blow trial, or cop out to 3 to 6 
 Bad situations, being a man is hard shit, something'll get trapped out I mean, yo 
  
 You got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots 
 Black teens drop out of high school, white boys selling stock 
 With bonds they can't put their word on 
 20 years, shorty wop, pussy 'bout to swerve on 
  
 Up in the crib, new fridge, of dead pig 
 Two kids, from this older cat who looked like Calvin Coolidge 
 But got splat in his back last year, robbing this jew inside the diamond district 
 No one got convicted, heard they never found the biscuit 
  
 I'm booby trapped by the capitalists, trying to subsist 
 Sometimes happiness is hot grits and catfish, or a bowl of Cookie Crisp 
 I got harassed by this rookie bitch 
 Talkin' 'bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrant to tie my kicks 
  
 $50 ticket, 'bout to strike and picket 
 And shout at the City Hall, motherfuck the wicked 
 And greedy, give to the needy 
 Down on my luck, about to grab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me 
  
 Said, "Yo son, don't stress out over no one, learn the slogan: 
 Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on 
 And don't be counterfeit 
 It's a bad situation just being a man, but we got to handle it" 
  
 Bad situation we in bein' a man[Intro] 
 Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad.. 
 You know I love you 
  
 [Hook: Intrigue] 
 But what I saw it wasn't me 
 But what I saw in front of me 
 Oh baby baby you was acting so shady 
 I thought that you were stickin' me 
 Another girl you're tricking me 
 I gotta go cause I thought that I was yo' baby 
  
 But what I saw it wasn't me 
 But what I saw in front of me 
 Oh baby baby you was acting so crazy 
 I thought that you were stickin' me 
 Another girl you're tricking me 
 I gotta go cause I thought that you were my baby 
  
 [RZA] 
 Girl you can't trick me 
 Nor can you stick me 
 You try to play slickly said you strictly dickly 
 But you and your friends you play the licky licky 
 I figured it out when I caught that hickey 
 Between yo' legs where your chocolate split be 
 Now Bob Digi gotta toss you like Frisbee 
 Out the window 
 Off and away you go 
 'Ain't got no time and no love for hoes, fuck 
 How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched? 
 And ramped up in the back of my truck 
 Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would 
 Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good 
 Bobby 
 Now walk the block with black hoody hat 
 Dog on the prowl tryin' to snatch the little putty-cat 
 They red riding hood 
 And I'm the big wolf 
 'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush 
 And push push through your power-u 
 Goosh goosh explode my load 
 Have it running down your toosh toosh 
 Now you sneakin' around like a crook crook 
 Tryin' to look inside my phone book book 
 Bout to loose it all girl you shook shook 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks

 [Beretta 9] 
 C'mon man save it go ahead with that boo 
 Oh you take me for a fool 
 I send my sister for you 
 Claim I'm sneakin' sleepin' creepin' cheatin' you buggin' yo 
 Listenin' to yo' cuzin' mad because she a lonely ho 
 Simple fickle minded dizzy tryin' to insult I 
 Now you wanna go and turn around and then ask why 
 Peace be out bounce 
 Spread yo' wings fly 
 Me lie c'mon how? 
 That ain't god's style 
 C'mon man 
 You don't know me by now? 
 Three years in 
 I should of messed around but somehow

 Girl I was ya' nigga' until 
 Ya switched the whole current 
 And if that's how you feel

 Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad ... You know I love you 
  
 Hook [1x][Hook: Dexter Wiggles] 
 I thought I'd never, see the sun 
 I thought it never shine again 
 Then the sun came, back round again 
 Since you came in my life and then 
 Like there was no clouds, stand on water 
 Glory came to shine again 
 It's a glorious dayyyyyyyyyyy 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, they say great minds think alike, we used to drink all night 
 Think about things that's wrong and how to make it right 
 Ice cold bottles of brass, and time flashes 
 A hundred blunts passes, before the God askes 
 What's the square miles of the planet, why is the axis slanted? 
 How much is covered by water, how much is granite? 
 Every second is the past, every second is the future 
 Every second is the present, how long does it last? 
 True I Master Equality, God Body be 
 Flowing like the Chi energy, inside your arterries 
 Hand design jewels and rhymes, like fine potery 
 Even if you went ten time platinum and struck lottery 
 All the material that you gain in this world 
 Wouldn't match the price of a snowflake in hell 
 Bobby, did it all, boy, before you was born 
 Ya'll front like ya'll thugs, but ya'll niggas be pawn 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [RZA] 
 Whether million or billion, or trillion, or quadrillion 
 Or quintillion, or even six sextillion 
 We still be building, revealing the truth 
 All the knowledge that these devils be concealing, it won't stop til 
 Every soul is killed, then, and healed then 
 Opressed by the pen, serve the clip, angel wings 
 Only to be awoken by a Killa Bee sting 
 Injected with the venom of truth, I defend the youth 
 The black choppers, I spot 'em through the circle 
 Go 'head, bust my whip, snake, my shit is gun proof 
 But the darkest spot in your mind's not sunproof 
 Here comes the proof, son, we present the proof 
  
 [Hook 2X][Intro: RZA] 
 Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it 
 Get it, get it, get it, get it 
 And so as Bobby... 
 And so as Bobby... 
 And so as Bobby start to learn more jewels of life 
 He became more the wiser, and the RZA was being 
 Manifested from within 
 For a new embryo, had been born through the cypher 
 Bringin' forth into existence, the Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah 
 And he started to spit shit like this 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, Happy New Year, throw on your Wu-Wear 
 We true here, you crab derelict bastards, you can't push through here 
 The ice melter, you best to to dive for ya shelter 
 This assignment is called Alpha Phi Sigma Phi Delta 
 Digi tech, 36 tech, eject pellet 
 Rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it 
 Then them hook, walked through justice in books 
 Scotch whiskey, in the middle of Patty, with four Glocks wit me 
 Hair puller trigger nigga, 16-shot dart spitta 
 Chart splittas, who walk through the hood, heart bitter 
 For industrialized rapped capitalist, trynna snatch a crack of this 
 BZA bitch, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip 
  
 And bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as Joan of Arc 
  
 While ya dogs just bark, bark, bark 
 We spread this attitude, to every point of latitude 
 Every street crevice, every corner, every avenue 
 I might be on the Eiffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffle 
 Ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth 
 You can taste it diverse, the blood thirst 
 I start to bring the great Flood, first, first, first 
  
 [Outro: RZA] 
 So as his mind start to grow 
 He start expression himself through his hip hop culture 
 Changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square 
  
 Build it better himself to those around him 
 And he start talkin like this... 
  
 Hungry men have no respect for law, or authority, or human life 
 A man's bread and butter is only Insured if he works for it 
 Leadership means everything, pain, blood and death 
 What night is to day, man is to woman, and woman is to man Fear is the state of nervousness, only fit for children, not men 
 All men are created equal, so to fear man, is to offend God 
 Fear is to lose control of ones nerves, then you become like a helpless deer, or a featherless bird 
 We stated the the true and living, living true 
 And these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like Marcus Garvey 
 Start to build up inside Bobby's head 
 And it lead him to the knowledge of himself 
 And he became a strong muthafucka![Intro - Jammie Sommers] (RZA): 
 Yo, yeah yeah, yo what? 
 (Gotta spit on these bitches real quick) 
 Yea, Jammie Sommers bring the thunder, what?

 Pearly handle, scroll Brooklyn, we bouncin, commercial keep lookin 
 Pussy tight ginger, turn rough cats to cringers

 We Break Bread and deal with equality 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo check it, my break and deal with this son 
 Explicit lyrical orgy, you bitches smell like dead foggy ho 
 While Jammie splash you with the bottle of Giorgio 
 Or Chanel's No. 5, dog bitch you can't survive 
 You buy and shoot some straw ride, ya tried to glide on B.O.B.B.Y 
 Jammie Sommers, treat her like my daughter, real niggas wanna fuck her 
 Pass a quart of milk, crab, clam, possum, wild flower blossomin 
 Power-U, have you gaspin for your oxygen 
 Gold bra straps, fine pointed, purple star Gaps 
 Cowboy boots and tastle, with the straw hat 
 You derelict hoes, we fuck y'all without pullin down our clothes 
 While your nigga wish to lick Jammie Sommers' toes 
 Imaginate, you best to go home son and masturbate 
 Or put your ten dollars up and buy the fat tape 
  
 [Jammie Sommers] 
 Yo, a hundred thousand, two hundred and fifty cash 
 Yo now, watch Miss Sommers, shake that ass 
 Yo, you love the way my brother splash

 Mouth muscle, card shuffle, belt buckle 
 Jammie S'll never kiss ass after I close a deal 
 You best to believe this rap shit I say is for real 
 A lot of y'all bitches be good earners with two out 
 Take too many chances, chillin with niggas, lampin 
 Profilin, wildin, Jammie hung with the realty smilin 
 Takin shots at Louie the thirteenth, and tie you up 
 Bathed in Sheik, so you could watch your man beat his meat 
 Cuz, uh, lodi dodi, I got the body 
 And tutti fruiti, I got the booty 
 I shake, my rump, all in ya face 
 Make a bitch tie my sneaker lace

 And the European release of the LP

 You best to slob the knob G 
 You could never catch the great Bobby, indestructible 
 High producer production 
 Suck to the wall like suction cups 
 Yea what the fuck is up you duck 
 You better slip 
 Or get your wrist slit 
 Ultimate legit, can't quit when it comes to making hits 
 A phat ass track I quickly program it 
 For others could see me, its like Smothers brothers 
 You get spread on bread like the butter 
 Peanut, what, see what, B what, razor blade cut from 
 Your neck to your gut 
 Have no shackle 
 Easy for me to tackle 
 Best to watch back cause my razor sharp style 
 Grapples MC's 
 With the eagle claw clutch 
 I'm just to much to touch 
 Keep the mike beside me like Starks and Hutch 
 Word Up quick to roll a dutch and puff it up 
 Blunts everyday in the month 
 No need to front 
 We cause the blood to gush 
 Operation push, it's the Wu! 
 You scarecrow, jump off the road 
 You best to reload, your gat black 
 And get your whole shit back phat 
 Don't step to me with that 
 We can't have that weak that 
 Bob Digital inside your citadel 
 Shit is critical, word it's gonna take a miracle 
 For MC's fall to the fallacy 
 Here's my rhyme policy 
 Acknowledge me 
 I keep the high quantity plus quality 
 Equal make you see the sequel 
 Defiant eagles can't match me or royal regal 
 Lethal eagle techniques 
 Word up when I speak the dialect 
 It makes girls' pussys get wet 
 While niggas hit the rewind on my casette 
 We could make a thousand dollar bet 
 Bobby never failed yet 
 Bout to strike gold 
 Got Big Free on the ones and two 
 Break it down for them one time 
  
 Chorus: 
 Do you hear the bells? 
 I hear the bells 
 Can you hear the bells? 
 Bobby, can you hear the bells?

 Buh-Bobby, Buh-Bobby

 Fucking up the mike be a hobby! 
 Crab motherfuckers try to step up to rob me 
 Bitch you must be stupid, slob the knob Z 
 B-O-B-B-Y D-I-G-I-T-A-L, Bobby Digital 
 Served well keep the phat clientele 
 I watch you crab niggas fail 
 Try to sail the boat but couldn't stay afloat 
 I float on a note like a Staten Island ferry boat 
 Keep my rhyme chocolate coat 
 Bitch you know when you bite my shit it taste sweet 
 Going down your throat 
 Point 'em out let me sort em out 
 The fattest links we sport 'em out 
 Nuts bubbling boosted from extra scouts from Dublin 
 I could fuck a dozen birds and watch a dozen hatch 
 I bake my cake from scratch 
 Keep the cream inside the middle 
 Make you dribble 
 That's when I scribble on the paper 
 To write this script I had to cut down forty acres of trees 
 Process the wood to make the notebook sheets 
 Blinded from the steel spiral imported from Ohio 
 Delivered like the spin whirlwind kick Morio 
 Bitch you best to read my bio 
 First chapter the back breaker chiropractor technique 
 Word up dislocate your shoulder blade joint 
 We striking every pressure point 
 The high priest solid gold diamond fang teeth 
 With the high tech brief around your neck 
 I still breach your skin girlfriend 
 Let me enter your zone 
 Microphones get cast like stone 
 Niggas can't never bone how I bone 
 Word you soft as a shell 
 You ain't worth one skin cell 
 Big broiler crack your back and your head like an eggshell 
 And Bobby will scramble you 
 Bitch you want to make a bet all right we'll gamble too 
 Quick to roll see low 
 Catch the loop like Niko 
 Duck watch out for Roscoe Pico train 
 See Sirus with the great dame 
 Tryin to infiltrate the game 
 Wu-Tang Clan, Wu-Tang Clan 
 Special brand name slang 
 From the book of the Ichang 
 The world changed once Bobby came 
 You better go and check your storage 
 Wait a minute Goldilocks who the fucks been eating my porridge? 
 Somebody been sitting in my chair 
 Someone been sleeping in my bed 
 It ain't Goldilocks! 
 Slope down the ice with bobsleds 
 Bobby smoke 'til his eyes get red 
 Word up you best to turn your head and don't look 
 Inside my rhyme book 
 You might get your whole soul took 
 I make the world shake, I make the world shake 
 Then the whole universe quake and then it shook 
 Bobby fishy fishy was caught inside my brook 
 Daddy caught him with a hook 
 Moma fried him in the pan 
 And Bobby ate it like a man 
 Wu-Tang Clan special brand 
 Get the logo 
 Bounce on your head with the pogo stick 
 Rock the wild horse with the Polo 
 Word up we speaking wild 
 Quick flash like a photo 
 Yea, yea Dorothy you better go find Toto cause we 
 Ain't in Kansas anymore 
 It's the killa bee shores, all out war 
 Before you go here you best to go there 
 And see it clear 
 Through your third eye 
 With a curb, with the high post up most 
 Don't play up close 
 Razor blade technique that strikes you 
 Overdose MC's quickly, strictly, hip hoply 
 You could never stop me, rock me, mock me or pass me 
 Cause I'm fast like Kawasaki 
 And when you see me coming through 
 With the vroom vroom vroom 
 That means your bitch ass is doomed 
 So give me room 
 And stand back and hand that mike back to the man Jack 
 Unfair black 
 I slam that track on trains like Amtrak 
 Go to shaolin isle, that's where my fams at 
 What you doing you can't ripple the gripple son 
 You get dipped up like Lipton's tea bags 
 Or you get spit on like the sea hag 
 And I smoke a fat tray bag of equality 
 Don't bother me 
 You probably never really heard of B-O-B-B-Y 
 D-I-G-T-A-L 
 Supreme Clientele served well 
 Buh-Bobby fucking up microphones is a hobby 
 Buh-Bobby, buh-Bobby, buh-Bobby 
  
 Chorus: 
 Do you hear the bells? 
 I hear the bells 
 Can you hear the bells? 
  
 [RZA] 
 Buh-Bobby, fucking up microphones is my hobby 
 You get tossed like cracks locked down inside the lobby 
 Sucker motherfucker stepped up and tried to rob me for my Cuban link 
 What did he think? What did he think? 
 What was he thinking? What the fuck was he drinking? 
 Bitch you be blast in the head like Abe Lincoln 
 Have you whole body shrinking 
 Did you believe the killa bees always swarming 
 Alarming, calming sound that makes MC's feel how I feel 
 You best to chill bitch and eat a booger 
 Word up or get cut up by the juga 
 Razor blade sharp RZA 
 Word shame on a nza 
 Who try to run game on a nza 
 You get broken down like a puzzle with to many equal prisms 
 Positions, oppositions 
 Here's the transmissions 
 Word up I raid the phat sample without the glitching 
 Why you bitchin'? Why you bitchin'? 
 Buggin out cause my style it keeps switchin', it keeps switchin' 
 Oh shit I'm itchin', I'm itchin' for a scrap can't catch that 
 Who could be the match? 
 Who wanna match palms? 
 I remain calm 
 Like the 18 bronze man 
 Come to the shaolin chamber of danger feel the anger 
 The mad stranger 
 Wu-Tang Clan keep a finger 
 Tucked inside the back pocket 
 Blast like a rocket 
 Word up knock your eyes out the socket 
 Here's my new topic 
 I don't give a fuck if you had a whole neck full of garlic 
 Around you my fangs will puncture your jugular veins 
 And you'll be in deep, deep, deep, deep pain 
 Why oh why oh why do they try? 
 To B-O-B-B-Y D-I-G-I-T-A-L 
 Bobby Digital fucking up mikes a be my hobby 
 Point 'em out, puh-point 'em out 
  
 RZA: Yo this just a little freestyle for ya'll niggas

 Butter pec', make my nutter weak 
 And ya'll crabs down south, you ain't got a clue 
 How it feel to slip in that papi chino power u 
 White Cadillac truck just high beamed us 
 Mami look like she was Angie Martinez 
 I don't espanol, I play imposter 
 I was like "Mamacita, yah yah, que pasa?" 
 Let's slip back to my casa 
 She was like "Nigga! You sound like rasta!" 
 I'm the ace in the decks... 
  
 *girl speaking spanish* 
  
 [RZA] 
 I'm the ace in the deck, still casin' a Tec 
 That filled with the taste of the lead, buck buck 
 The bass and the treb', the space in the back 
 Where chumps walk by, and they face get slapped 
 I'm not known to talk a lot 
 Sit on five whips, son, so I don't walk a lot 
 Got ten chicks, so I don't hawk a lot 
 Been around the world, but I love New York a lot 
 Especially up in Bedstuy, with those crazy Cuffies 
 Or in Fort Green, with those crazy Cuffies 
 Ya'll floss like ya'll Jay-Z and Puffy's 
 You get robbed, bucked down by a crazy Cuffie 
 Bobby! Fuckin' the mics is my hobby

 Yo make the drop off, don't forget man!

 Pumpin' them packs, packs 
 To my workers that stays sharp like razors 
 Play my part and blaze it, we braveheart with paper 
 My niggas got that Dutch, Dutch 
 Niggas got that black, black 
 Niggas got a bitch, bitch, head in they lap, lap

 Leaned and pivot, schemed for digits

 Nigga front then we get at duke 
 Dick hard like statues go to hole like Shaq do 
 Cut you like a cantelope 
 Like Iverson the truth and the answer 
 I'm the poison and the antidote 
 Don't care if the bitch cute, we don't sex raw 
 We play the corners like the castles on a chess board 
 Up in the Lex 4, drinkin' a Beck's boy 
 Shoppin' in the best stores, I'm the nigga to check for

 Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed 
 No tattoo on titties, sayin' F-R-E

 Direction of the cop inside the chopper

 This bitch on my side, with no panties, finger pop her 
 Ten pounds of skunk up in the front trunk 
 Bird like hittin' a blunt, about to cum, and I'm pinchin' her cunt *girl moans* 
 Ninety miles per hour I'm like "Fuck these punks!" 
 It's the land of the free son, you only live once 
 You a smart motherfucker or stupid dunce? 
 Music blastin', she orgasm like a singer 
 Sweet, wet pussy got all over my fingers 
 Now I'm sniffin' my hand, I'm shiftin' the plan 
 Got the pedal to the floor, goin' swift as I can 
 Hit the exit, chk-chk-chuh, make the left quick 
 Hit the garage and slip inside the Lexus 
 I got many whips, many clips, many chicks 
 And my dick's been sucked by many lips 
 Many tips, on many vicks, many sticks 
 And left the God with plenty chips

 He got many whips, many clips, many chicks 
 And his dick's been sucked by many lips 
 Many tips, on many vicks, many sticks 
 And left the bar with plenty chips

 Twisted bottle cap 
 Yamulke, Harmonica salute 
 Goon, Vidal Sassoon, boom 
 I ain't gotta rap 
 Polish off the Molotov cocktail 
 Felafel rocket launch weapon 
 Hold, plead the 5th 
 Cocaine in the pita pit 
 No name need to spit 
 Making sure Kosha Dillz really it 
 One man fight, might pop a wheelie kid 
 Just another guy, pray that my mother lie 
 Heavenly the day I day I better be 
 Walk the hinges from the feet up off the inches 
 9 milimeter off seal, I mean business 
 I mean business, see me for 
 Cock pistol, reload, shoot 
 Street money, CPR 
 Teach you scars, double down 
 3 new cards, no parole, max out 
 Killa, I eat through bars 
 New Jersey journey pot 
 Wild Turkey Hershey spot 
 Watch out, til the block house 
 Nut house get shot out 
 Shout out a shout out to 
 Cop house, I got out 
 Back to the grill again 
 And a grill get knocked out 
 Fortified with vitamins from Israel 
 To fight your lands, Kosha Dillz

 Gotta be hood to love it 
 All throughout the suburbs 
 Get heard like it's rubbish 
 Get blood spilled, sidewalks 
 With drugs and some slugs lit 
 Blocks where the Bloods is 
 Some niggas on some Cuz shit 
 Gutter biz, that's that beef smell 
 In the alleyway 
 Murder rate, yellow tape 
 Another way the ? is played 
 With a stomach growl in place 
 Can't make the hunger stop 
 Same ? hungry block 
 It's that white game, dice game 
 And I'mma spot shorties 
 Between the brides, already 
 Youngest exec to run a block 
 This is where they dump a shot body 
 In that dumpster 
 Hood life, this that scene where 
 The fiends live the hooked life 
 Hard white, cooked right 
 They searching for that good price 
 This that scene where 
 The fiends live the hooked life 
 Hard white, cooked right 
 They searching for that good priceBurst, better run, better run for your life! 
 Burst, break, run, jet, flee, boogey, move, be audi (yo) 
 Slide, duck, dip, bounce, be ghost, escape, blazini, poof 
 The Genie, disappear, cast out like they ain't seen me (yo) ... 
 (Yo) Burst! 
  
 Put the key in the ignition friction sparks my transmission 
 I'm gear shiftin, fast lane switchin, tryin to ditch em 
 Escape, I got the briefcase full of papers 
 Plus the microtape of all the secret society snakes 
 Recordings, plan how they want to destroy the black man 
 And take every square inch of land and kill the Wu Clan 
 What the fuck? My four hundred horsepower truck 
 High speed with the Ironman CD turned all the way up 
 Shots fired in back of me, they practically hit my tire 
 Yo I smell smoke, I hope my engine ain't on fire 
 Pulled off the road, hope this damn truck won't explode 
 Felt like a scene from the last James Bond episode 
 Drivin sixty miles per hour through weed trees and dead flowers 
 Bust the overdrive, couldn't control the power 
 Pushin through bushes, mud, bugs 
 Covered the front and back windshield like carwash suds 
 I couldn't see, I knew these niggas was gainin on me 
 I tried to bust a 360, I crashed into a tree 
 It felt like a bulldozer, knocked my ass over 
 I fell out the Rover, grabbed the briefcase ran over 
 To a log cabin, had a sign posted DO NOT ENTER 
 I bust through the door my body got cut up with splinters 
 I ain't give a FUCK, tryin to find somewhere to duck 
 Ahh, ahh, uhhhhh, ahh 
 And catch my breath, count how many shots I had left 
 My clip was full, the first nigga walk through I'm gonna pull 
 It was Ivan Korlof, he came through with a sawed off 
 Bust the cannon shot and tore the rest of the fuckin door off 
  
 Burst, break, run, jet, flee, boogey, move, be audi 
 Slide, duck, dip, bounce, be ghost, escape, blazini, poof 
 The Genie, disappear, cast out like they ain't seen me 
 Killer Bee, fast lamborghini 
 (repeat 2X) 
  
 Junk turned fragments scattered in all direction 
 One grazed me, on my kneecap but didn't faze me 
 Count to three, jumped up, I fired back 
 My four-four snub slug, dug a hole in his head 
 Like Dig Dug, partner crashes in 
 With the infrared precision shots, just missin 
 Night vision goggles, shit had me boggled 
 Forty-Four mag, was too much to swallow 
 Held the briefcase in front of my face, jumped through the window 
 Daring, got up and went like Dr. Kimball 
  
 I burst, broke, ran, jetted, fleed, boogied, moved, was audi 
 Slid, ducked, dipped, bounced, ghost, escaped, blazini, poof 
 The Genie, disappear, niggas out like they ain't seen me 
 Killer Bee move with the speed of lamborghini 
  
 Bobby Steels on the track, word up 
 Bout to escape with the tape 
 Word up[Hook: Tru James] 
 My woman, and my money, don't own me... 
 I've got to, keep holding, my own 
  
 [RZA] 
 Heaven, heaven... 
 The dangerous dynamite dosage, mind full of explosives 
 Digital brain is the closest to Moses 
 Civilizing came, the flame inside the hoister 
 Revitalize the game, the names on the poster 
 The mask with no cape, the flash'll crush grapes 
 The dancer on the lap, the ass wit no face 
 It's shaped like an ace, say your grace before you taste it 
 Haste makes waste, slow down or you ain't wait 
 The bunny in the car look like an Indian squall 
 The honey's in the jar, the money's in the bra 
 It's funny hahaha, how dummies, hahaha 
 Think cuz we call 'em sunny, they can be a star 
 I implement the instrument, disintegrate the 10 percent 
 You entered the square, but you don't know where the circle went 
 You ain't worth the cent, you cursed, I Birthed the Prince 
 Drenched the baby from creators that the nurses sent 
 You can't still convent, don't have seven cents 
 Grave the raven, my birds are heaven sent 
 Where the brethren went? where the Reverend went? 
 I told you these words are heaven sent 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Monk] 
 It's time to show you how them rugged MC's rock 
 If that's steel you see, it's that steel I pop 
 If that Benz I walk, it's that Benz I cop 
 Who rock them white tees first, get a West Cost props 
 Can't nobody it better than, the West Coast veteran 
 Three six letterman, Monk's the name 
 Black Knights the gang, I'll ignite the flames 
 Strike my hood up on the wall, and cross out your name 
 With a K on the end of it, that won't be the end of it 
 Til them guns is drawn, and you standing on the end of it 
 Poof be gone, I'mma write that wrong 
 I'm the shit all by myself, nobody writes my song 
 Peep my technique, strictly gangsta classics 
 Gun talk, nigga, muthafuck theatrics 
 My flow is matchless, ain't no way you can surpass this 
 Level I'm on, better go home, and try to practice 
  
 [Christbearer] 
 Why yes, am I next to impress 
 D-T-S, bless the best, no cess 
 Stress, from guess to gold press 
 The quest to protest, we head the Pro Keds 
 But this is the new improved shit 
 '08 from the AMG, '92, bitch 
  
 [Hook][Junior Reid] 
 Blessed love my lark, blessed love empress 
 All teaching of ways, all prince and all princess 
 Gods and goddess, kings of de earths, kings of de earths 
 Heeeya-hahahahaha!

 Yo

 Jah live the +Righteous Way+ 
 Teaching the youths of today 
 Bobby Digital do and then them say 
 Love with me today 
 Love with me today 
 Baby this is what they say 
 I'm gonna lead the youths in my stray 
 No foul play, no foul play 
 Want them of love all the way, and no foul play 
 Want them of love and not the negative way 
 RZA want no drive-by car, then we will see about how we are 
 Am I going the digital way, send all the youth to the digital way 
  
 Jah live the +Righteous Way+ 
 Leading the youth of today 
 Tell them to watch and pray 
 A child shall lead the way, the way 
  
 Jah live the +Righteous Way+ 
 Teaching the youths of today 
 Bobby Digital do agree to tell them say 
 Love shall lead - love is the only way 
 Love we want in America, in Jamaica, and in Africa 
 Love all over the world, for all women boys and girls 
 Men women boys and girls 
  
 [RZA] 
 Let it be known 
 Let it be-let it be known 
 Let it be known 
 Some said Bobby oughta burn in hell because these fancy bitches 
 Got a closet full of kung-fu flicks and nasty pictures 
 A library to decipher anything religious 
 He beg for mercy, we pray for Allah forgiveness 
 Rough nights, tough nights police cuff tight 
 Locked the fuck up, someone's mad enough to snuff Mike 
 Couldn't fuck right or puff right 
 This 15-year-old bastard got drunk and stuck like 
 The kid in the GangStarr vid, Just to Get a Rep 
 Pop was a klep, moms out on the steps 
 See sometimes he feel like a motherless, starve for another kiss 
 At night search the skies and searchin for the mothership 
 Only to find it's all inside yourself 
 Are you ready for the things of mental health? 
 This old man had a lack of mental health 
 Because his grandfather clock got to old for his shelf 
 So he had to die with a cold on his chest 
 The Old Earth said that the soul went to rest 
 Something that we never could understand 
 Is what he told me, sayin; 
 "Yo, how could the ghost be holy?" 
 That's what he told me, when I watch TV all I see 
 Is unfriendly ghosts is bustin through like Scream Part 3 
  
 [Junior Reid] 
 Them say Digital way 
 All the youths, them ah say 
 They wants them to live in the Rastaman way 
 Now follow Babylon way, long time nah Babylon ah lead them astray 
 They want Bobby Digital way, say the pussy and the +Righteous Way+ 
 Want the Rastaman way, Rastaman never lead you astray 
 Righteous way 
 Righteous way 
 Now lead the youths, them astray 
 Tell them to watch and pray 
 Just, watch and pray 
 Jah will lead the way 
 A brighter day 
 Youths are the future, oh yeahThe word comes from Islam and is meant to be a universal greeting. It's the only word I use to begin and end each communication with my fellow man. "Peace"--it's the prevention of conflict. "Peace"--it establishes both parties on a ground of mutual respect no matter who they are. "Peace"--it's universal. If an alien jumps in front of your ass, comes at you like "BLAAH!"--you can still say "Peace." He may even understand you. 
      Peace. The whole energy of the word itself is good. 
      Peace. 
      But as they say, come in peace, but prepare for war.[Chorus: Infinite] 
 I'm my brother's, brother's keeper 
 Through the struggle, our bond is deeper 
 I know you'll be there, when I need ya 
 Cuz we're brothers, brother's keeper 
  
 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 Nevertheless, in spite of 
 Sibling rivalries, my kin will still ride for me 
 I'm back to society, killas be moving silently 
 The world steady trying me, my girl steady trying me 
 At least I got my brother, he never 'fraid to die wit me 
 Through our trials and tribulations, it's torturous 
 With a bulletproof bond, hell fire ain't even scorching this 
 Ten times stronger than the magic of a sorceress 
 And never put a broad first, no matter how gorgeous she is 
 We rugged warriors, always come out victorious 
 Our battles be the gloriest, but that's just how the story is 
 Love is love love, and all is fair in love and war 
 My comrade a killer, to the solid core we keep it raw 
 I got your back like a chiropractor blood pure 
 [Chorus] 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, no other could compare to a brother, even from another mother 
 We bond and love her, our spirits hover over each other 
 In mutual conflicts, chained together like convicts 
 I hold you up by my shoulders, under your armpits 
 He ain't heavy, he my broham, ready for the program 
 Whether busting shots, throwing blocks, swinging swords, throwing hands 
 They can end to the end, not near friends 
 A kin beyond skin complexion, a hard connection 
 God protection, loyal, without question 
 My heart is his heart, my possession his possession 
 Although life is daily right, makes us sometimes appear weaker 
 I'm still there for you brother, I'm my brother's keeper 
 Blessed be the meak, if we strive and to be meaker 
 Plus, we flow together like the mic through the speaker 
 Through good times and bad times, happy or sad times 
 Anytime, all the time, until we reach a flatline 
 Link like medallions to cables, mixers to turntables 
 Never turn on each other, like Cain did to Abel 
 Nah, we stay stable, from the grave to the cradle 
 And after I save myself, I promise I will save you 
 Cuz you my brother, and i'm my brother's keeper 
 You're my brother, and I'm my brother's keeper 
  
 [Chorus][RZA/Bobby Digital, (Beretta 9)] 
 Yo, what up, dunn, (yo, yo, yo) 
 Aiyyo, peace, yo, what up, dunn

 Got all the word on the street)

 Caught them cats at store 
 Some bugged out shit was going on last night 
 Fucking with them niggas off the av. and shit 
 You know (word) niggas be bugging out there 
 (yo, what's the word on the street) 
 Yo, fuck that, yo 
  
 I heard cops raided the weed spot in 4D 
 Then bagged these two dreads and that 85 kid Corey 
 You know who I mean, he moved from Shaolin to Queens 
 Fronting like he was down with the Escobar team 
 (I heard T.T. got shot in the ass over some wiz 
 And pooky caught two to the chest but, yo, he lived) 
 And plus little dude with Lar, they got busted 
 (I told them niggas, don't be slinging while they dusted) 
 Yo, you seen my little cousin Shawn and his man Ross? 
 (yea, shawn broke his arm on the basketball court) 
 Word, his sister Bebe got got off form welfare 
 And those two nappy head kids got sent back to child care 
 Bathis, he got slapped by maljin 
 Acting like he had ah armor tank in his crib 
 (yea, that faggot ass nigga caught that beef from his rib) 
 It's the projects, dunn, you got one life to live 
 (Murder, he caught two for a triple homicide) 
 Mental rhyme disorder shit but never testified 
 Hold on, god, chill, my other line 
 (make it fast, kid, don't have me on hold for a long time 
 It's twenty cents a call and I only got a dime 
 It's hot on the block and I'm surrounded by crime) 
 Yo, aiyyo, shit, yo, check the drama, that was my little nigga hama 
 He said he just got some power-u from your niece tanya[Hook: Thea] 
 Your love so Digi, ahh 
 You make me dizzy, ahh

 Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh 
  
 [RZA] 
 Heart pounding, chart bounded 
 God astounded, well rounded 
 Lost and founded, stay surrounded 
 By these hoes, who can't count it 
  
 Park the whip, then dismount it 
 Forty ounce, yeah, I down 'em 
 Shorties drowns in pools of love 
 With these ounces, I be lounging 
  
 Roof thugs 
 Chew on slugs 
 Maneuver through 
 Hoods and clubs 
  
 Purple kush, by the bush 
 Dick is curved like Nike swoosh 
 Push, push, in this bush 
 Guaranteed to make her shush 
  
 Red bone, head on tilt 
 Six hundred cell phone bill 
 Big trucks, shell toe wheels 
 Velcro's loose, hell hold feels 
  
 Sell no pills, sell no deals 
 Niggas' styles, just no frills 
 You best to chill 
 Nigga, Nigga, yea, you best to chill 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
  
 Women I love 'em, leave 'em 
 Lust 'em, but I don't trust 'em 
 The reason most men be bugging 
 My lovin' Digi, you heard me? 
  
 Might finger fuck 'em 
 They suck me off in return 
 Women I love 'em 
 They love me back in return 
  
 I'm just a young man 
 Head smart, cock strong 
 Got my swag' on 
 Throw a mean dart, fuck it, we on 
  
 And got this fly talk 
 I kick that ass to the curb 
 You on the sidewalk 
 You gon' respect the dons words 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Crisis] 
 Hypnotized by her hips and thighs 
 Beasting on the bitch, I ain't gon' lie 
 The H-E-Double N-E, Double S-Y 
 Got me in the vibe, her ass is super sized 
  
 I can see the future up in her eyes 
 We'll be dumb high, keep her occupied 
 Til the son rise, I beat it up right 
 Then she can't deny, she heard the roosters cry 
  
 Break her ass down with some crucial lines 
 Nasty darts known to seduce the mind 
 She all up in my world, she ain't even my girl 
 But she knowing my world produce dollar signs 
  
 Whispered in my ear, she'll swallow mine 
 Like she don't do this freaky type of shit all the time 
 Like she was the one, or her head was that bum 
 I be dumb, sprung and just call her mine 
  
 [Hook][Intro: RZA] 
 Yeah, yo, what up yo? 
 Yeah, yeah, what up? 
 Nothin', man, hold on 
 Someone beepin' on my other line and shit 
 Nigga, I've seen everything I wanted to see 
 Come on son, yo, in my Range Rover runnin' out this muthafucka and shit 
 I be there in ninety minutes, aight, I make a stop 
 Aight, peace, one-one 
  
 [RZA] 
 I'm up in the Cherry Range, drivin' fast through heavy rains 
 My mind's on everything, my Wiz, my seed, the five pounds of weed 
 My dog got bagged with tryin' to sling in D.C 
 My cell phone rings off the hook: "brrring!" 
 "Kinetic 9: Yo, what's the word, king?" 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 Duckin' lights, b.s. and problems, pushin' through Holland Tunnel 
 Tryin' to avoid getting caught up in the funnel 
 'Cuz in the jungle, sometimes you gotta rumble 
 With the, the Beez... 
  
 [RZA] 
 ... That's why we study degrees 
 And keep our third eye open for c-cypher punks 
 Will bag you for a blunt and lock you up for a month 
 You've seen Bird? You had beef with that chump 
 And I heard he came home from a two-year slump 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 Yeah, I heard, I got the pump in the trunk 
 And when I see that crab, I'm a dump in his lump 
 'Cuz niggas ain't shit but welfare cheese 
  
 [RZA] 
 With their food stamp bitches and their coupon seeds 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 Frontin' with their platinum like they're O's and G's 
  
 [RZA] 
 When faced with the gat, niggas pose and freeze 
 And melt like snow on my windshield, that windmills 
 In my mind spin, they give skin chills 
 Yo, son, we gotta make them deals 
 For ten mill's so we can pay them bills, yo 
  
 [Hook: RZA & Beretta 9] 
 You wanna eat how we wanna eat, live how we wanna live

 But you don't seem to care, you just wanna wear 
 Prada one-sided but can't afford a pair 
 Up in your mom's lab, twenty-two, scallywag

 Gettin' your coochie ragged by an old sugar dad 
 Dreamin' bout them things that you could of been, you should of had

 Big Tigger putting it down with common sense 
 His new album called "Birth of a Prince" 
 You gon' cop that, it's in the stores black 
 And don't act whack, or you'll get clapped back 
 It's Big Tigger and my man Rza-Resurrector 
 Putting it down, I'll be like the freestyle perfecter 
 Got my girl T-Losting from Boston 
 But we all Yankee fans and of course n'...

 It's the Resurrector, yo I'm sipping off the golden nectar 
 I may chew you down like Hannibal Lecter 
 So respect to the Inspectah Deck'star 
 You know my check'sta, I'm microphone check 
 Might just wet you 
 I blink cataracts from 40 feet back 
 And I make rap beats over 43 tracks, yo 
 Who wear fleece, in a Gucci linen 
 I get drunk with the cops, I'm boning police women 
  
 [Verse 3: Big Tigger] 
 Yeah, you how me and my crew bang 
 We do things like Wu-Tang, so what'cha you wanna do 
 How you want it? - we gonna give it to you raw 
 And you can check us everyday, right here, live at 4 
 But tomorrow, no, you won't see me 
 Cause we airing the BET awards live at 3 
 Holla back now, it's Big Tig' doing it 
 With the freestyle, so come back now 
  
 [Verse 4: RZA] 
 It's Black Entertainment, yesterday I made my arrangement 
 And the judge: "you know I can't budge, because I'm thick like fudge" 
 The black ghetto Prince, leave no metal prints 
 I may push through your hood on a back of an elephant 
 Police escort, gat in my Jansport knapsack 
 Plus and I just left court 
 And I was late for my court date 
 Cause I was up all night boning strawberry shortcake 
  
 [Verse 5: Big Tigger] 
 Yes, we're keeping it critical 
 It's Big Tigger with my man the Rza AKA Bobby Digital 
 It's going down right now, putting it down for all Shaolin

 But yes I'm still flossing 
 Rza come on, and shut it down 
 I'ma turn it to you over right now 
  
 [Verse 6: RZA] 
 Yo check I'm not senile, meanwhile it's back to the freestyle 
 You wanna get burnt, you get turned, like the turn-style

 I gotta glow makes the halls be like yo 
 Washers on the Wheels of Steel, Bobby Digital 
 Used to called Bobby Steels, Park Hill, Shaolin Island 
 BET - Black Entertainment TV, where you could see me:

 To the tune of the black knights, yo 
 {Straight to the horn, Killarm, Killarm} 
  
 [P.R. Terrorist] 
 Contemplate on how to run this shit 
 Universally, forever blunted 
 Reflect shots off my forcefield, this shit will split your nugget 
 Thoughts too rugged, extortioning CREAM from off the budget 
 Refugees, all the Terrorist fans, they fuckin love it 
 Insurance can't cover it, your maximum is minimum 
 Niggas, they tryin to dub it, yo 
 It's the hottest shit on the streets 
 Since summer '86, my prefix is like a remix 
 Throwing bricks, try and dub this shit, it's accurate 
 Come for your head, it's immaculate 
 Conception, when my weapon's busting 
 Shots, niggas try to discuss my business around the neighborhood 
  
 [Doc Doom] 
 Yo, switchblade, grenade, rhyme flows 
 Buck niggas like wild rhinos 
 Up in these killing fields you bound to die slow 
 Your style staggers like a drunken whino 
 That's why there's no hope to defeat a Black Knight 
 That's like tryin to walk a tight rope 
 Switchblade, grenade, rhyme flows 
 Buck niggas like wild rhinos 
 Up in these killing fields you bound to die slow 
 Your style staggers like a drunken whino 
 That's why there's no hope to defeat a black knight 
 That's like tryin to walk a tight rope 
 With no feet, mercenary team, streets of concrete 
 Sasquatch, dump a nigga ass, so why try the 
 Invinsible, Dr. destructor 
 My lyrics bring war like Lebanon 
 Our troup's a Desert Storm, it be on son 
 Compton is the city where I come from 
 Act dumb if you want to, and catch a hot one 
 It's that real, knuckle up, lace your boots tight 
 Don't give a fuck cause every night is our night 
  
 [Killa Sin] 
 These rap icons, smash, spit fire out of cons 
 Fuck bigons, rely on islam in my python 
 Squeeze off, long fist, when I'm pissed 
 Result of this, gun powder cover my wrist 
 Blasphemous, how these fake fucks cursing my name 
 Knowing damn well, I'm hurting the same 
 What part of the game you playing? Kid, I'm sayin' 
 Yo, three months ago you was on, falling short now 
 Chasing the Don, your money ain't long 
 Faggot fucks, bag 'em up, stick 'em in the back of my truck 
 Strip 'em and smack 'em up for acting up 
 He slithering, hit him in the ribs again 
 Broke the code of honor that we living in 
 Could lead to the whole click dismemberin' 
 Never that, Killarm roll strong 
 Even though you gone, Wise, the crew will still hold on 
 I love you, in that dream you probably told me who busted you 
 Should have paid attention but I slept 
 So for that I gotta dust two devils off 
 Headed off, all that, fucking blow trial style

 Fuck this shit, (Serve Justice)

 Let me touch this, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.. 
  
 {*this part is cut off on the US version*} 
  
 Thieves gather under red moonlight when doom strikes 
 Leaving maroon sights in saloon fights and wound lives 
 My harpoon's flight can't be recorded by human retinas 
 Bite me and you'll catch more shots to the stomach then tetanus 
 I'm foaming at the mouth when I talk, King Holocaust with a crooked walk 
 Whoever looking soft is getting tooken off, shook and lost, cracked in half 
 I take...ugh.. {*laughs*} 
  
 [P.R. Terrorist] 
 I take, I take all fake snakes, grab 'em, by they heads, grab 'em

 Watch your ho look at me, like I'm Leonardo DiCaprio 
 Wanna stick her tip of her tongue through my piss hole 
 You play the target, and I be the guiding missile 
 Oh, how they long this strong grissle 
 Yup, see that flesh is weak 
 But it taste so good, they want the recipe 
 The king catch the queen, don't mess with me 
 Kssh, yo, my niggas never grow up, drink til they throw up 
 Some sniff that cocaine til they fucking brains blow up 
 Drunk from that Brass Monkey, grass junkies 
 Walk around with the brain of a Crash Dummie 
 How dare you try to come and gas cash from me 
 You be in the House of a 1,000 Corpse like Rob Zombie 
 It's I God, inside your iPod 
 Cuz my squad, nigga, is die hard

 Who rock meaner, than the Gods from Medina 
 You numb skull girls, be caught you talking Tina

 Bitch, suck a dick and die, forty five lit the sky 
 Fool, let the shit fly, split, right between your eye 
 Nothing like that little slit split in between her thighs 
 Sitting on the nine, applehead, bitch, let it ride 
 Hickory dickory, block, niggas is slippery 
 Glocks tucked down my socks, secures my victory 
 You like fourth period, son, you're history 
 White girls with big ass, I check them suspiciously 
 Vanilla praline, had the saline 
 Stuffed inside her jeans, made the niggas day dream

 Dear momma, no need for the head drama 
 I quit slinging that yac', don't need the feds on us 
 I made a mil' off the deal, legit 
 After I pay the tax, I'mma buy us a crib 
 In the winter, I'mma buy us a whip 
 So we can take long trips, just me and the kids 
 I'm up again, I never let you down 
 Nothings ever gonna stop me now 
 I'm up from the gwop, don't gotta hide from the cops 
 Plus homey's got a spot, they can stay off the block 
 They can drop a few tracks, or spar a few minds 
 The God home from the pen, he left the yard behind 
 Got a brand new sampler, take the breaks and I loop it 
 Got a license for the gat, in case the public is stupid 
 Plus, I ain't afraid to shoot it 
 A man with the family, is firmly rooted 
  
 [Interlude: Talani Rabb] 
 We on top right now, we living 
 Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us 
 We killing, look at this, yo, just sweet in here 
 We did it, we ain't gotta worry bout nothing no more 
 We on top right now, we living 
 Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us 
 I always know you was gonna make it 
 You was a dreamer, from day one 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 What shall I speak, about the brothers that passed? 
 Make me weak about the knees, make me wanna bust ass 
 Or should I kick knowledge, and I ain't even graduate 
 But take it from me, it ain't cool to skip class, imagine it 
 Five Gods, came to picture perfect, to ovulate to it 
 Music and expression of freedom, escape to it 
 Not much to it, we was born and conceived to it 
 And me being the man that I am, the same could do it 
 Surrounded by a civilized man, a weak woman 
 Subconsciously be planting a fed, inside children 
 Allow me to explain my cause, or who I B-E-R-E, Double T, A, N-I-N-E 
 A/K/A K-I-N-E-T-I-C, my attribute B-O-R-N G-O-D Allah 
 Searching for the truth in myself, I seen, I saw 
 In order to achieve it all, must give my all 
  
 [Interlude: Talani Rabb] 
 I always know you was gonna make it 
 You was a dreamer, from day one 
 Look at how you killing them right now 
 Why don't you go get you a massage or something, daddy 
 Ain't gotta worry bout none of that 
 Matter fact, pass me the oil 
 I got you all day, you know you did your thing 
 Just sit back and relax 
  
 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 Off up in the C-H-I, C-A to the G-O 
 Where the winter time temperature be twenty below 
 Knee deep up in the snow, the Reverend still get dough 
 To pay the bills, feed his family and go get more 
 Money, now we taking trips to Jamaica, just to relax 
 My homey's came a long way since paper from g-packs 
 But gone, they used to be pushing BP's and Zenax 
 Now they wire us our paper back and forth like we fax 
 We ask the lord and savior for guidance 
 It's probably hard to hear us over gunshots and violence 
 Figure when I'm in the casket it'll be plenty silence 
 So in the end, when you add it up, it all balance 
 The crew been up, staying higher than pallets 
 On vacations in the islands, watching women with talents 
 Fellowship and with the family members who be the wildest 
 Now we live in mansions, castles and golden palaces 
  
 [Interlude: Talani Rabb] 
 Into everything that you put your hard work into 
 Look at the gold on the lamp, baby 
 Look at the size of this TV 
 Look at everything, just take up all the beauty in this room right now 
 Look at how you did your thing, you did it 
 We living right now, we ain't gotta worry bout nothing no more 
 Yeah... hahahaha...

 Verse One: RZA 
  
 Put away your heaters, throw up your dick beaters 
 Accurate blows to his nose shut his eyes closed to a centimeter 
 Bitches on the fences wonderin what the fuck the suspense is 
 I land heavy uppercuts in the corner of the park fences 
 Knocked his mouthpiece front teeth got locked inside my knuckle 
 He grabbed the belt buckle, attempt to catch me with a couple 
 Of low blows to the nuts, on ringside was as a giant du-els 
 Send your Barb for this fuckin jew On a Wire 
 He couldn't chessbox that's when he reached for his ahhs 
 Brother chopped me on the top of my knot, but he got stopped 
 When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled 
 A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle 
 He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell 
 That was his ass black 
 So when it comes to physical combat 
 We can take it hand to hand or go beyond that 
 Do you want my gat to make the contact? 
 Retirin cats who lack the heart to fire back? 
 [We take all crabs overboard] 
  
 Chorus: Raekwon 
  
 Put down the gun son, son matter of fact, shoot the one on one 
 Hold it down, make sure the head, sure nuff don't hit the ground 
 Lampin on the handball courts, or the square, we can take it there 
 Settle it son, who the champion? 
  
 [It's like that, niggas want to front, one more time? 
 I'mma show you like this. One on each side 
 This is it word up. We gonna lay you back 
 We gonna rest your back, you won't know how to act 
 When it come to bigger, showin and provin 
 Niggas styles is wack] Who the champion? Settle it son 
  
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killer 
  
 Yo! 
 I had to run up on this King I Divine, for his shines 
 He saw the stash and caught my mailbox for eighty dimes 
 He saw me stashin, like a pipe-link for mega fiends 
 I held it down like the finger fly miraculous King 
 Peep through the heavy small get the camoflouge 
 Starks master in charge, pushin through every building, sippin egg nog 
 Niggas know my status God body carry big batters 
 Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs 
 And earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent 
 What the hell just made him fuck with my intelligent? 
 Back to pollyin', I heard some noise we pack a two twelve 
 There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale 
 He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass 
 Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash 
 I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God 
 Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets 
 Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off 
 You's a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss 
 I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him 
 Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin him 
 I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side 
 Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw 
 I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin 
 The King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and 
 He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin trees and 
 I'm still breathin, bleedin because it's frontin season 
 Now I got that project belt, international/national 
 Worldwide, I let Shamel slide

 Niggas was psyched out, Beretta brought the dirt bike out 
 Everlast just came home, it was his first night out 
 He was arguin' with these bitches how they don't mind their business 
 When he was locked the fuck down, no one came to visit 
 He was snuffed, black, his little cousin Moe stuck Cap 
 That's Miss Sommers on the bike with the gat like, "Fuck that" 
 But finessin' over here, he could've wished he had ten more years 
 Cracked a cold beer then bust a shot in the air 
 Everlast, ego went full blast, didn't splash it 
 He'd act like his head was too big for the casket 
 I told him, "Slow down God, you ain't wild 
 You ain't been in these projects in a while 
 Runnin' 'round with that old school style" 
 Don't think these young bucks won't lay you down like tile 
 A hard head makes a soft ass, these New York lads 
 Chopped faces, you talk fast - they bust off fast 
 And chase you out the hood, in a bloody hood 
 Yo, son, you seen that kid was actin' Hollywood? 
  
 [Killa Sin] 
 Yeah, I mean that nigga, clap happy Cali, clap when he 'ttack 
 Most get astounded by sorrounded sound effects in the back 
 Adidas shoe, phat laces, packin' buldge in his jacket 
 Head nappy, black and nasty, but he nasty for gats 
 He nas', passed me, bumped me and laughed, then flashed me his Mac 
 Said, "I got sixteen for you, we could bang on the track" 
 So strap this, nah, this bar's a bullet, par pull it 
 In fact, blast me bastard, I done came to far for this 
  
 [Solomon Childs] 
 Boulevard life, remember late nights? 
 Mama stomach touchin' a bed, two bids 
 Cats sacky in Comstack, retire from the crack 
 I'm askin' Allah that the warm Hennessy help me 
 I ain't chose the struggle, the struggle chose me 
 Lord forgive me fore I have stolen from my brothers 
 Snaked my brothers, even killed my brothers 
 Familiar fishscale, everybody plays the fool 
 The +Older Gods+ givin' me jewels 
 The younger Gods givin' me tools 
 Solomon Allah, I feel I was jerked 
 To the drug dealers, my baby mother's a flirt 
 Holey socks, one fatigue suit, what you feel it don't hurt? 
 That's my problem now, I ain't afraid to talk 
 Still cop coke from the well Willy 
 When I was young I got robbed from the neighborhood bully 
 'Til he forced me to hit him with the nine milli' 
 Now him and his click know that I'm a thug fully 
  
 [Hook x2: Solomon Childs][Intro: Tim Westwood (Mr. Tibbs) {Skinnyman} [Blade]] 
 Yo this is Westwood 
 I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight 
 And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there 
 My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah}, Blade [what's up?] 
 And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me? 
 {Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA 
 Straight from the Wu-Tang} 
 [Yeah this is Blade and the track, the hot new joints called the Boing, Boing] 
  
 (Yeah representin' live all my UK hip hop heads in the North Side, el tarno) 
 Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go 
  
 [Skinnyman (RZA)] 
 Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless 
 Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes 
 My God given talent is all that I can do best 
 Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed 
 So who requested my time on the set 
 Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet 
 Ya best upthreat cuz it gets better yet 
 I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent 
 So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA) 
 What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet 
 We'll never let anybody else step 
 Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect 
 If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept 
 I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get 
 Cuz everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin' 
 Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again 
 Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again 
 Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then 
 So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels 
 He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal 
 He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel 
 Lookin' for a mill' while you screamin' "keep it real!" 
 So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold 
 Request the higher force to sweep over my soul 
 So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals 
 I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role

 Calm but still merciless, rugged on impact 
 Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback 
 Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina 
 Hand it to a amature, show him how to damage a 
 Live set, make him feel the full effect 
 And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left? 
 Four men remain standin' like Gladiators 
 When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears 
 For years its been the same with minds of the artillery 
 God forgave us all for the merciless delivery 
 Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip 
 Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate 
 Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams 
 There's a world of CREAM 
 If all goes correct we can stash supreme 
 Feed the fiend cuz that's the way it was meant to have been 
 You should of seen the comin', the language is universal 
 One time perfect attack with no rehearsal 
 Shook the Earth for what it's worth 
 You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global 
 We can find them whatever your predictions 
 Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons 
 It might be hard to believe 
 We invade, we conquer and lead

 I'm a country man at heart but a city man by nature 
 Cuz even though it's fuck free, it's all about the paper 
 I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca 
 Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater 
 Avoids the green, even from my early teens 
 ???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen) 
 But then I had a dream 'bout bein' the best rapper 
 But that ain't what it seems, next chapter 
 That's spreadin' the word 
 Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard 
 I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me 
 All that respect, keeper know 'nough of them will bore me 
 Singin' the same story, I'm better than you 
 And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools 
 We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet 
 That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap 
 You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me 
 Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps

 And set flames to the sky, we aim high 
 The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi 
 Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust 
 You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up 
 To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot 
 Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot

 I ain't hate 'em, I ain't make 'em make mistakes 
 But I'mma break 'em, the cops, could I shake 'em 
 Or will they catch me and charge me 
 On the streets I put something in ya, that'll send you to God 
 Meet my man, we don't have to roll, candy when we ride 
 She love it, when I give her, pull her panties to the side 
 Bullet loco, you might catch me breaking and entering 
 Mama, I had to jump bail right before the sentencing 
  
 [W.C.] 
 Get it up in 'em, cool, that strip and claimin' the set 
 And quick to Sway the Tech, ya'll straight bang and connect 
 It's the dog, ya'll get it off, on your backpack and blue marker 
 Chronic smoke cougher, I don't shoot walker 
 Dub Sizzle on the remix, the last to speak 
 Now it's all coming together like sweaty gas leaks 
 Fo' sure, a nigga will say, 'yo, it's Dub C'

 Cherries on the top, I grind for the gwop

 I pulled off with Juanita in a two-seater 
 Just left the lover, shorty loved it, shit was off the meter 
 High speed down the block, she had the hammer by Peter 
 Flipped her tongue inside my ear, I was like shit, mama mia! 
 Bong, I threw on a smooth slow song 
 As I stuck my two fingers in between her thong 
 She was like, "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" 
 "Tu headache, ah popa chulo, de hablo Bobby" 
  
 [Chorus 2X: Ndira] 
 Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)

 [Fat Joe] 
 Yeah 
 Yo it's the God Joey Crack and Bobby Digi 
 It looks like these Wu-Tang niggas beat me to the trizzi 
 They got mami's all over the place 
 Makin' out with each other and givin' niggas face 
 I'm so excited I'm invited to your party 
 And I'm on the ferry right now with some blunts and Bacardi 
 Headin' to the Island, not P.R. but Shaolin 
 Where every nigga got a Wu-Tang medallion 
 I'm in Stapleton, it's Off the Wall 
 We puffin' L's in the staircase, the fourth floor 
 Shorties givin' me brains, she thought she had me 
 'Til I flipped her over and mad her scream, "Daddy!" 
  
 [Chorus 2X] 
  
 [Method Man] 
 Hey, hey, hey.. 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh.. 
 Eh eh eh eh eh.. 
  
 Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'? 
 It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True) 
 I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in 
 Your popi two-way beepin', let him know that you cheatin' 
 Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes 
 There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows 
 You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose 
 We can play doctor soon as I drop my jabows 
  
 [Chorus 2X][Intro: RZA] 
 One, two, it’s the Brooklyn Zu 
 Three, four, better shut your door 
 Five, six, nigga, get yo' shit 
 Seven, eight, gonna lay 'em to sleep 
 One, two, it’s the Brooklyn Zu 
 Three, four, nigga, shut your door! 
  
 [Verse 1: Shorty Shitstain] 
 I make money, money don’t make me 
 I squeeze them honies, homie don’t hate me 
 I keep my money in a Hefty bag 
 Fuck a safe, I pack a fo-fo automatic 
 I ain’t your average rapper, I ain’t your average camper 
 I’m on some new shit and you can get adapter 
 I had it up to here, I had it up to here 
 Wit' niggas, with them counterfeitin' flows this year! 
 I know a lot of ya’ll niggas can’t get it right 
 Just can’t get it right, just can’t get it right 
  
 [Hook: RZA] 
 Y'all niggas, just can’t get it right 
 Just can’t get it, just, just can’t get it right! 
  
 [Verse 2: 12 O'Clock] 
 Hold guns like the bar that hold the shower curtains 
 I’m in the club, watch my watch, let my diamonds flirtin' 
 Time to leave, and these two girls sayin' somethin' 
 Cross the Brooklyn Bridge, now a nigga finger fucking 
 Papa Wu crib full, C.R.E.A.M, watch the purses 
 You better believe I’m holding like the service 
 K-Tab rock bulletproof suburbans 
 Two more suburbans, bodyguards rockin' turbans 
 Putman Avenue, Uncle Freddy watch the dirt in 
 Take Saudi and murder it, soundtrack 4-thirdin' 
  
 [Hook 2: RZA & (Shorty Shitstain)] 
 (I know a lot of ya’ll niggas can’t get it right) 
 (Just can’t get it right, just can’t get it right) 
 Y'all niggas, just can’t get it right 
 Just can’t get it, just, just can’t get it right! 
  
 [Verse 3: Young Dirty Bastard] 
 Born in a race that lies no definition 
 Write rhymes in brown sand, fuck the composition! 
 Eliminatin' those who are fake is my decision 
 I send the hail mary to your God, now convert ya whole religion 
 If the sky had eyes, he could see the pussyness 
 In all you tender loving business guys 
 I can see the future maggots in all you flies 
 Hammer start seeing the weakness, niggas terrified 
 Listen, I fed a pig to a savage then he jumped like rabbit 
 Dumped a ball in a hoop then he caught AIDS 
  
 [Hook 2]{*instrumental for the first 11 seconds*} 
  
 [Skit: RZA] 
 For the supreme architecture 
 That's the one who come with the most illest ideas 
 The one who come with the illest creation 
 A supreme architecture is actually someone who build the universe 
 If I personally say I'm the supreme architecture 
 I'm I'm lettin Allah speak right, right there knahmsayin? 
 I'm speakin right through that, I'm I'm becomin a vehicle 
  
 {*15 seconds of instrumental*} 
  
 [Skit: RZA] 
 Word it's like the truth 
 They say the truth shall set you free 
 You hear the truth, it sets you free 
 So, mathematics is truth 
 When it adds up, there's no error 
 The only time there's an error 
 When man miscalculate his own... problem 
 Know what I mean, his own equations(Rakeem) 
 Yo, this is sexcapades, the sexcapades 
  
 [Hook] 
 Baggin ladies, drive 'em crazy 
 That's my everyday routine 
 I don't bug on this, we be lovin it 
 They be singin "Oh we love Rakeem!" 
 And as I get them, I just hit them 
 With the center of my love 
 And once they're afflicted, they're addicted (why G?) 
 Cause they're on you like a drug 
  
 [Verse One] 
 So let me speak, on a goal I seek 
 How many freaks can I bag in the course of a week 
 Yo get this they strip with the quickness 
 Cause they can't resist the Ra style of slickness 
 Once activated, right, they become captivated 
 Sexually infatuated (by who?) 
 By the slick majestic kid wit the braids 
 What is this? And this is sexcapades 
 Episode one - I'm down at a store 
 Saw a young girl that I wanted to explore 
 I said "Peace, yo my name is Rakeem" 
 She replied "Hi, my name is Charlene 
 But all my friends, they call me Cha Cha" 
 I said "Word, now you can call me Ra Ra" 
 She said "Why, are ya rowdy?" 
 I said "Nah-hah that's not my style see 
 When brothers wanna shoot and have gang fights 
 I like to lounge and get pootang all night" 
 That was the end of the convo 
 Next thing you know, we're back at her condo 
 She had a grill like an actress, catch this 
 Jacuzzi and vibrating mattress 
 Now the Ra was on a mission 
 To do the Humpty Hump in a vertical postion 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 Aiyyo, yo, yo 
 Let's get on with the episode 
 Scene two, I'm walking down Clove road 
 A day, a gloomy day 
 The plants cold scrubbin for light because the sky was gray 
 But I was lookin dope if I may say so (you may say so) 
 Cause my gear was in there like Prego 
 And as I walked I saw up ahead of me 
 A girl, top choice breed like a pedigree 
 Now now now now, I didn't wanna past yet 
 I stayed behind so I could sweat her assets 
 She had credentials, influential body potential 
 Somethin I would love to slide into 
 So, without a moment to waste 
 I slid over like I was slidin to home base 
 Yes I was successful, usin my special 
 Wu-Tang slang, that captured her brain 
 Next step, was sex yep 
 Not to disrespect, but I must protect my rep (you got to) 
 And at the crib I told her to entice me 
 She played Michel'le and said that she was NICETY 
 I said "Yo listen baby check it; it's one or the other 
 Liar, lover, fronter or fucker? 
 And guess which choice she chose 
 The one that had her lyin in my bed with no clothes 
 And the Ra was all on her 
 Cause you can save that NICETY shit for ya mama 
 DMD dicks 'em down 
 And skips town like Casanova Brown 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah and this is sexcapades, the sexcapades 
 The sex the sex the sexcapades 
 The sexcapades 
 Yo what time is it kid? 
 Yo It's time to get laid 
 And this is sexcapades (Word) 
 Yo what time is it kid? 
 Yo It's time to get laid 
 And this is sexcapades 
 There was a Ra, there was a -Keem 
 There's a A there's a Lah 
 Strikes again never hitting below the belt 
 '91 gettin things done 
 Word DMD type thang and I say

 A brother strive to stay alive without killing no one 
 His swordplay exceeds the speed of your gun 
 He's stunned by the sliced, so pertrise, so concise 
 Dice your arm off before you even bring twice 
 Still old afro naughty king of a castle 
 Part of William statues for those who died in battle 
 Ninjas flow like a sparrow, twist up like a gyro 
 Trying to bring my father back through synthetic bio 
 Ceeo must be evil for outta for cathedral 
 To think she can go against the mighty Afro 
 Oh! no whether friend or foe 
 Until voted number one they all fall below

 Killarm woodlot my third eye is my shield 
 I choose to kill by will 
 Duckin parole, now I am on the run like track and field 
 The black Samson, keep a blade in my afro

 Watch me kill this bitch ass nigga in slow mo'

 He got to be the number one one oneThe legendary number one headband 
 It's promise is power, omnipotence 
 Immortality 
 But at what cost? 
 One that is greater than any man can imagine 
 And heavier than any man can bare 
 No soul who has ever wore it's tattered grace 
 Has ever escaped the torment of it's infinite burden 
  
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
  
 [Intro: P. Dot w/ RZA laughing] 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (Afro!) 
  
 [Chorus 2X: P. Dot (RZA)] 
 So many times I had sneak up on them quicker 
 With my finger on the trigger, like 
 Like I'm pulling out my sword 
 This is combat, man, this is war (Afro!) 
  
 [RZA] 
 Brain stained with the harbor, sword stained with the blood of martyrs 
 Revenge is a never ending story, Afro who's the author 
 Trying to bother, the bare site of my father 
 So I'm living today, like there's no tomorrow 
 Sword, inside my sheet, my heart is filled with beef 
 For all the dead souls, that I chopped into piece 
 Return, of the Afro sheen, fatal mean guillotine 
 Sword in my hand, I want the number one headband

 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

 [Dexter Wiggles] 
 Yo... here come the enemy 
 And what stands, and we will take... 
 For sure, the Lion of Judah stands within the way 
 Ready for the voices, to call out the other 
 Beware of the storm... 
  
 [60 Second Assassin] 
 Our opponents upon the threat with the mighty Gigantor 
 I'm rippin' this shit to pieces like Skeletor 
 The editor, senator of all rap, competitors 
 Get this job done on the mic quicker than -- 
 Financial or power, I attack with the sunshower 
 Get the new pres', the taste of God's power 
 Raining for forty days, burning for forty nights 
 Meteoroligists don't even pick up from the satelline 
 Coming a catastrophe, death of another M.C 
 Killed by the legendary G-O-D, as in me 
 Now rest in peace, six feet beneath, subconsciously 
 Periodically, and wake up and be somebody 
 I swam the shores and cause the laws and I recall 
 The rise and fall, but now see I walk tall 
 Never needed a slugger, my rapping's like the mugging 
 I rough up then tough up, I leave your shit left for supper 
 Hush up your busted, you can't be trusted 
 Give me a break out there, foolin' the puppet 
 On with the subject, cuz I'm tired of hearing this rubbish 
 Now get your stinking breath off the mic 
  
 "I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack" 
  
 *Leggezin Fin rappin' in foreign language* 
  
 [Leggezin Fin] 
 We had 30 years of war, live hardcore 
 For our souls through the sky, alotta soldiers died 
 You can't ever be denied when, words are only option 
 Before you close an eye, guarantee you'll be poppin 
 Ninety-nine percent, muthafuckas straight dropping 
 Leaders get starting, AK's, ASK's 
 With the magazine that say, real Leggezin 
 Aiyo, that's what I mean, people pray for the day 
 Of a good well being, man cry in your genes 
 If you steppin' cleans, enemies gettin' low 
 So he spy enemies, gather fake shit, counterfeit 
 Try to make a profit, still I crimes up for the rise 
 To the market, so many people starving, die for nothing 
 I bring you little something, keep the streets bumping 
 Love forever 
  
 "Take the sword!" 
 	"The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword!" 
 "I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack" 
 	"You Wu-Tang..." 
  
 [Crisis] 
 Who serving us? The Knights is superb with this 
 We lyrical murderers, your nervousness got you shaking like turbulence 
 The game need nourishment, so we came to nourish it 
 Give you lames encouragement, just the name get perished quick 
 Black Knights, we far from good samaritans 
 Keep the crowd rocking, you keep 'em nodding like heroine 
 In the veins of an addict, disrespect, brains'll get splattered 
 You strained from being subtracted, inflicting pain is a habit 
 Killa Cali mentality, rob & sell drugs for a salary 
 Niggas can't handle me, bring static like Channel 3 
 On the M-I-C, or on the streets leave you like Can it Be 
 You got served by my first verse, for living in a fantasy 
 Yessir, like my nigga Pharell, for real 
 Niggas get killed, Black Knights, we destroy then build 
  
 [Christbearer] 
 Yeah, I make it all seem so simple 
 Rock the mic with my quintessential, fundamental 
 Killing them off, Christbearer the boss 
 The young Rick Ross on the freeway, yeah 
 I see the rats run the relay 
 Yeah, the judge, the jury, the prosecutor, the DEA 
 Yeah, Christbearer, he say 
 And he's an O.G. when he flex it, like it's suppose to be 
 The freestyle champ, keep it amped 
 Then, nobody in the camp gets served 
 When I swerve, Christbearer the king, I bring 
 The, fire, the rain, I touch 'em, insane 
 So psycho, yeah, I'm in the PJ's 
 In the projects, I go, insane 
  
 [Rugged Monk] 
 Monk spit fact not fiction, my written is too forbidden 
 It be touched, to even bitten, you wack niggas submitting 
 Spit darts, rap it so accurate, pierce right through your hollow bones 
 Graphic clones, couldn't see me on the microphone 
 Pen and pad, line for line, bar for bar, you take a choice 
 Your courage is flattering, but your need couldn't come close 
 To the Rugged M-O-N-K, vivid lyrical wordplay 
 Display a chamber of rhymes, you couldn't match on your best day 
 I leave that ass wet like a dolphin, laid in a coffin 
 Compton's where I come from, and shit happen's often 
 What you know about a nigga dying, for natural causes 
 He got, hit in his neck, now that's natural for flossing 
 Even my girl say I'm stuck in my ways 
 Ever since back in the days, been thugging, dumping with K's 
 And I'm still at it, still slinging, word to them crack addicts 
 Still acting, still quick to keep the beef cracking 
  
 [5 Foot Hyper Sniper] 
 My dosage of murder is a movie 
 3000 Miles to Graceland, alotta gun clapping, man 
 Chicks say Dre Street, the last man, specialist, man 
 I represents a crime family, nominated for Grammy's 
 Brooklyn Zu, up in the casino, chips like Bingo 
 Flights to Reno, my team's 'source' like Benzino 
 You 'supreme', we got 'clientele', more kings in jail 
 We so dangerous, we don't get bail 
 Judge wanna, let me rot in the cell 
 I got to escape like Alcatraz, I be on the run like Ol' Dirty Bast' 
 With a suitcase full of cash, royalties ever stash 
 And I got dough from paid shows 
 Like uptown, and Tonight at the Apollo 
 Dre Street, a tough act to follow, jumped out the Silverado 
 Fuck the fifty talent, ahh, bullets flying through the air 
 Like spirals on a football, like it was thrown by Brett Favre 
  
 "Take the sword!" 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 You should pray that I climb the ladder, instead of waving the wand 
 Having to abracadabra, he is no longer with us 
 I couldn't be any gladder, like the kid on Christmas 
 Who couldn't be any badder, got everything that I asked for 
 Including the six shooter, gloves with the hat and mask 
 And you was giving it up so, no reason to ask 
 And we be living it up, future, present and past 
 A bit of pimp in my strut, make it like I got class 
 Wine in the wine glass, fine bitch with a fine ass 
 And her friend too, the evil that men do 
 Just cuz I got cash, will I figure I take two 
 Or maybe three of those, how we treat them hoes 
  
 "Take the sword!" 
 	"The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword!" 
 	"You Wu-Tang..."

 [The Reverend William Burk] 
 Take your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword 
 Give your soul back to the church, son, give it back to the lord 
 Take your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword 
 Give your soul back to the church, give it back to the lord 
 You playing with them rooks, knights, bishops, kings 
 Queens, bishops, knights, rooks 
 Knowledge equal pawns, frontlines, jagged hooks 
 Gold shields, illest crooks for the boldest juks 
 We eating soul food, cooked good, now what's it shook 
 It took for one to see the pork without the pieces on it 
 It takes for one to grab the cross as if it's Jesus on it 
 It take for one to see the poor pit with the preacher's on it 
 It take for one to hear the system with no speakers on it 
 And still know that it's all there with the features on it 
 Like them Cadillacs with woofers and them tweeters on it 
 We in stadiums, the floors and the bleachers want it 
 In high school I even had my women teachers on it 
  
 [RZA] 
 We keep diamonds in small packets like sunflower seeds 
 When my Glock get a cold, it throws a gunpowder sneeze 
 Achoo, blow a fever at you non believers 
 I bet your cornerback won't intercept the receiver 
 Of this hundred meter bullet, trigger pull back when I pull it 
 A quarter inch, I clear the whole bench, I clear the whole field 
 And the building, your boy Bobby Steels been 
 Trapped in the projects, playing spades with the pilgrims 
 Now I"m back on O-R, aiyo, pa 
 The Glock goes pop pop, now it's back tok the Alamo 
  
 "I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack, now 
 Because of it..." 
 "Take the sword!" 
 	"The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword" 
  
 [Outro: sample] 
 When a man wants to attract the female 
 The best way is to apply a musk perfume 
 But when a man uses a musk perfume 
 There are two important things he must be aware of 
 One; is that he will get the woman he wants 
 Even if she woudln't ordinarily succumb to his charms 
 The other is that his own special odor, his body's natural smell 
 Will change... 
 	The very demon of revenge seeks divine guidance? 
 	Haha, do you really think you can absolve yourself from sin? 
 	By sculpting, stupid little toys? 
 Who-ho, now that's some shit you don't see everyday 
 	You've fallen so far, coward 
 	I've been watching you, can you even raise your sword? 
 	Against another, where's the cold blooded killer, you once were 
 	Do you no longer have the stomach to fight? 
 	Will you remain a coward, even as your father suffers? 
 Oh, now, that just ain't nice 
 You don't have to listen to that shit 
 	And you have such a long long way to go 
 	To save your poor tortured father 
 	I've almost revived his rotten bones 
 	Oh he will live again, to feel pain 
 	To suffer, and you don't even have the number two headband yet 
 	So I have a few more days, or maybe even weeks 
 	To enjoy your father's pain 
 	Before you even have the right to challenge me 
 Watch[Verse: Tinashe] 
 High, high, baby right now 
 Cause when you hold me 
 Don't, don't leave me lonely 
 Thirsty, quench it for me 
 Cause when you hold me 
 Don't, don't leave me lonely 
  
 [Hook: Tinashe] 
 Years gone by without one other 
 Can't go back without my lover 
 Feinin', feinin', bring me a doctor 
 Need it, need it, bring me another 
 Years gone by with now or never 
 Can't go back without my poppa 
 Faintin', faintin', bring me a doctor 
 Need it, need it, bring me another

 Ahh, so good)[Intro: RZA]

 My crew is super duper fly and we came to get pai-aid 
 We pack those Glocks and razor blades, duckin' spa-a-a-ades

 [RZA] 
 Roll up the Winchester, call up my wife, Celestea Poindexter 
 Tell her bring back the black iron Mac strapped with two extra 
 Clips whizzin' at you, worms in the Big Apple 
 Potholes in the street crack the Benz axle 
 Don't let me come and descend my mens at you 
 You candid cats is fish Jack mackerel 
 B-O-B boy, fast like Bruce Leroy 
 Caramel sundae honey set the decoy 
 For you soldiers seekin' to de-stroy 
 Me, what the fuck you think we got the heat for? 
 You dunce, we knock out your gold fronts 
 Shorty got bigger and strong once she start smokin' blunts 
 With beef they get found in Hunt's 
 There's no chance to score, your best bet's to punt 
  
 [Chorus]

 I know R&B niggas that's harder than you 
 Young T.G.'s with more street smarts than you 
 Hit a liq', shit you ain't got the heart to do 
 And I bet the click you run with they bustas too 
 Fuck a pass, we come strapped when we passin' through 
 All types of straps, you get clapped just for actin' new 
 Collectin' more guns ever since my cash done grew 
 Bad ass with no dad so I'm a bastard too 
 Ask your crew, nigga, I gay-bash 'em too 
 Grab his strap then ski-mask and bash 'em too 
  
 [Madam Scheez] 
 West Cost rider, credit card slider 
 Roll up the windows and pass the lighter 
 I done turned into a lover, used to be a fighter 
 Now I pull out my guns and take 'em out one by one 
 You're refutable bitch, sittin' on pins and needles 
 I done seen bitches emotions breakin' up like The Beatles 
 Who's the real bitch now? Seen the fear in yo' tears 
 Next time grown folks is talkin', shut the fuck up here 
 A product of my environment until my retirement 
 Have a habit of the automatic breakin' up the static 
 And if y'all niggas wanna trip y'all can suck my dick 
 I got eight or nine of 'em, different colors and shit 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Timbo King] 
 Smell like the rain forest, got diamonds in the hood - flawless 
 Sable Taurus, spit a verse, no chorus 
 You're on the wrong turf, one of my songs worth 
 Two mil', eh-yo, red pill, blue pill 
 Still stay focused, off-white lotus, brokers 
 I'ma dead y'all slot time, no spins on the hot nine 
 Eh-yo, my hot nine got my whole block sign 
 I rhyme gangsta, pops was an O.G 
 I'm a junior, my son'll be the third 
 Let 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds (uh-huh) 
 Let 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds 
  
 [Shyheim] 
 Why you actin' cuckoo like you just flew over nest? 
 Like I give a fuck how much weight you bench 
 Shyheim, my government and my attributes 
 BIG left me the Tec and the nine at my crib, so Gimme the Loot 
 Or L.B.C. ya like Snoop, I'm out to get coof, again coof 
 Turn up the thermostat, peep the murder rap 
 'Bout to bring it back, in the name of crack 
 In the name of dope 
 Ridin' through the hood in the Diamondback with spokes 
 In the name of thai, cliches and skunk 
 I came to get high, came to get drunk 
 I came with the Tec, Bobby came with the pump 
 We left with the shines, left with two dimes 
 Sittin' on dubs, royal flush, five of a kind 
 Countin' the spare for the deuce-ooh-ooh-one 
 Nigga, our year, niggas, our year 
  
 [Freemurder] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yo, talkin' all drunk, makin' a rap right here 
 Fool remainders, like he can't get clapped right here 
 Fuck the walkin', Freemurder pack right here 
 On some napalm and bamboo track right there 
 Fuck twenty-five, shit, I'm strapped to the chair 
 Cuffie Crime Fam', my fifth black in the air 
 Y'all don't want none, lead ya back down the stairs 
 Once the Mac appear 
 Four heat, I ain't hit 'im, shoot back fire wit 'im 
 Whole empire wit 'im, never plea guilty, I ain't hit 'im 
 Guess who lyin' wit 'im 
 Left po', ya dead broke like Holy's ear when Tyson bit 'im 
 Still on point like lime segment 
 Pull out joints, the nine wet men 
 Double action, don't want no trouble, askin' 
 "Who I be?", Murder like Tai Chi 
 Get ya brain tilt 
 New Yorker, Brooklyn is where he come from[Verse 1] 
 In the place to be 
 It's the K-I-N-E- 
 T-I-C 
 Here to represent the 
 M-I-C 
 The shards will slip me 
 Ain't no D-I-P 
 And a bitch to convince me 
 The D-I-C 
 And the K will eventually 
 M-A-C 
 And a P for potentially 
 I-M-P 
 She said "I can't stay" 
 And it doesn't make sense to me 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 If you don't know, I'll show you how 
 It can take all night, it can take a while 
 If we do this right, we can do it now 
 And I'll be good to you 
 She said "yo okay and I like your style 
 But I like the way that you make me smile 
 And I'm yours tonight if alright with you 
 Before I see you through" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 So nasty 
 I feel, got me feeling so nasty 
 Get nasty 
 Feeling so nasty 
 She nasty 
 I feel, oh God, I’m feeling so nasty 
 So nasty 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Feeling like a million bucks 
 Plus interest 
 Pussy make power you 
 But can’t tempt this 
 Maybe for a hour or two 
 I might hop in the shower with you 
 Say, yo, skip the romancin’ 
 Don’t shed yo tears dancin’ 
 Said I’m gone for the wait 
 To guess how I’m panting 
 I got these groupies black 
 They save room for a Scooby-Snack 
 Fuck this up and 
 She’s a freakin 
 A down ass bitch 
 Who’s down for eatin’ 
 First dude know those hoes be sweetin’ 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 If you don't know, I'll show you how 
 It can take all night, it can take a while 
 If we do this right, we can do it now 
 Say I'll be good to you 
 (We’re nasty) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 So nasty 
 I feel, got me feeling so nasty 
 Get nasty 
 Feeling so nasty 
 She nasty 
 I feel, oh God, I’m feeling so nasty 
 So nasty

 Eh-yo, man, fuckin'.. 
 Mothafuckin' Billy, man 
 Yeah, man 
 That mothafucka, man, just called me and shit 
 From fuckin', uh, some county jail, man 
 Down South or some shit 
 He's mothafuckin' crazy 
 I thought that nigga was comin' here next week too and shit 
 But I guess he went down South with them fuckin' white boys and shit 
 You know he love hangin' with them white boys and shit 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, yo, yo, Billy 
 He sniffed dope and swallow acid, took gulps of colt classics 
 Smoked hashes, tote plastic Glocks and low jackets 
 Cross country, cousin Billy with forty monkeys 
 Twenty white honkys, Harley Davidson bike junkies 
 In a convoy escapin' from Rosco P. Co 
 And those four redneck cops who had Rodney in a sleephold 
 The SWAT team, U.S. army shock team 
 The snipers who shot King, infrared dot beams 
 Aimed at windshields, gas tanks and wheels 
 From the bank they yanked the mil, hot lead and stainless steel 
 Shot through the helmets, cracked heads like Hellmanns jars 
 Ripped through the roofs and blew the hood off the car 
 A.T.F., F.B.I., D.E.A., chopper in the sky 
 Eye witness news on standby 
 Bill Beutel, it was Mit from the metly 
 Mint leaf tea dipped in P.C.P., hit to the head like a D.D.T 
 Hard on the gut like Mc D.L.T 
 C-cipher punks put the A.P.B 
 On these destroyers who was drunk off the J&B 
 Ran up in A&P, hit the safe at P&C 
 Documentary on A&E, eight P.M. E.S.T 
 Five P.T., the ho tapin' on V.C.R 
 Three victims shot, one was saved by C.P.R 
 Fuckin' Billy be wildin' 
 Like Robert L. Lee or Stonewall Jackson 
 He always out for action 
 I was at an eighteen hole golf course relaxin' 
 When I received the collect call, BOODOODOODOO 
 Collect call from cousin Billy 
  
 [Phone Skit: RZA ("Billy")] 
 (Eh-yo, Bobby, I'm in trouble) 
 Yo, what's goin' on, cousin? 
 What the fuck, man? 
 (Listen, yo I need fifty thousand) 
 Oh sh--, eh-yo, Kinetic 
 Check it out, nigga said he need fifty fuckin' g's Son 
 (Listen, yo, we got into a fight 
 In the bar, shit was just crazy) 
 Eh-yo, I heard you was fuckin' with the white boy Tommy again 
 Takin' that acid, nigga 
 (Yeah, oh yeah, we chillin' though 
 I just need you to come get me, for real) 
 No problem, son 
 Yo, I'll send my nigga Kinetic down to get you and shit (Aight) 
 Aight, there it is[Intro: Feven (RZA)] 
 Stressed out in an exclusive 
  
 (This is a Wu-Tang International world premiere, bodododododo) 
 Oh my God, I think I'm a havin' a rap attack 
  
 [Feven] 
 Go ahead and call me suburban slums of the chick 
  
 Though you don't know shit about me 
 Black refugee, twelve'll automatically 
 Shit is funny, the way you think I'm on ya money 
 Seein' mathematics, you think I'm makin' stacks, son 
 After I eat, the release hit, the more mouthes to feed 
 Back in Ave., countin' my gift to Gap 
  
 No shame in holdin' CREAM, but it ain't what it seems 
 And now I know how ya'll hate when niggas make the greens, nawhatimean? 
 See ya eyes bleedin' and envy Allah in Sweden 
 Britain Bahamans beemin' hatin' on my achievements, schemin' 
 And turbans, try to cause turbulence 
 And my essence, can't none of that shit touch my maintenance 
  
 Niggas all bling, bling, don't know how to handle the thing 
 It's not about how much ya earn, it's how you spend 
 And I choose life, before any God damn rights 
 Steppin' on some Satan shit, but I only fear twice 
  
 [Chorus 2X: Feven] 
 You on some hostile negative vibes 
 Negative lies, the style only makes me rise 
 To the top, mind states it and makes me wise 
  
 I'ma keep a step ahead and mesmurize 
  
 [Feven] 
 Growin' up I feel like an old soul trapped in a child's body 
 Mad strain on my brain but I kept most inside of me 
 For sure, was a quiet type and inside a drawer 
 Peeps tried to lock me out like, yeah, fun, it's for more 
 Straight outta war, couldn't ignore, scenes I was seein' 
  
 Quicker human being, part of Fam, by RZA, one would kill him 
 Couldn't feel him, period, had to get articulate 
 To express the mess, pen and paper and got blessed 
 Unless, I make my path straight, when I came, I ate 
 I be on some other shit, on the news front page 
  
 A heart filled wit rage, feel the pain after pain 
 Converted shit to positive things, I project on stage 
  
 Now they wanna hate on my shine, hate on my kind 
 Byut I know it's envy kid, I feel in my spine 
 Ain't nothing ya'll can say or do, to make me change my point of view 
 You better change ya attitude or I'mma get this bitch, son 
  
 [Chorus 2X] 
  
 [Interlude: RZA (Feven)] 
 This is a Wu-Tang International world premiere 
 (Oh my God, I think I'm havin' a rap attack) 
  
 [Feven] 
 My crouching tiger, gotta go hard, but still a fighter 
 I'm tighter, the son got problems facin' the facts 
 Survivor, ya'll can keep yappin' on the cypher 
  
 I'm killin' tracks, do ya own things, pick up ya acts 
 Matter of fact, if this is for ya'll to keep in mind 
 073-6291535 
  
 [RZA] 
 And sure ya on lead, whether ya hit this bleed 
 RZA ger dig kta grejer (RZA gives you the real stuff) 
  
 [Feven] 
 If you ain't been through shit, how can ya know shit? 
 If you talk that shit, if ya get ya bones split 
 I been bitin' my tongue, every time I heard somethin' 
 But now it's on, and keep in mind where I'm from 
  
 [Chorus 2X][Intro: Beretta 9] 
 Yeah, one two, check it 
  
 [Beretta 9] 
 Aiyo, what makes Kinetic get on some live wire shit? 
 Not much, but when Beretta, I'm on some set a fire shit 
 I'm no devil, but the flow is hell, though 
 Just on another level, I'm quick to tell you 'hell no' 
 And never trouble, I haven't been to jail, so 
 In case you see me there, don't think, I won't rebel, or 
 It's not, I don't care, just you're not playin' fair, bro' 
 That's where I stand, but you better get out my chair, hoe 
 Don't understand, but I bet you, hear the snare go 
 When I pop you in the ear, and your head bounce on the dance floor 
 Why you even think, you even had the chance for 
 B.O.B.B.Y., B9, and Diaz for? 
  
 [Chorus: RZA] 
 *Schh* You get shot in the ass for, talkin' that bullshit, and as for 
 You wild niggas tryin' to rap, like you bustin' them gats, ya'll dreaming 
 They be talkin' that they bustin' your cap 
 And they carryin' straps, but they dreamin' 
 Niggas be, dreamin', ya'll niggas just dreaming 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, chalked from the wood grain and alcohol, son, I chew barks 
 Spin your head like Technics, made you write the new mart 
 See The W footprint? Made from the shoe mark 
 Yeah, it's Bob Digital, bitch, not Bob Newhart 
 Splash through the Norwegian sea like Black Orca 
 Sippin' on weed, next beer with Johnny Walker 
 No scrutiny, no shipwreck, or mutiny 
 Got the kevlar suit, don't think about shooting me 
 Holding the golden scepter, you be folding 
 Bow to The RZA like the great King Oden 
 My wiz is mighty like is Isis, my son is like Osirus 
 Wu-Tang Clan be the wisest 
 Like Professor Xavier, got stock like Doctor Octavious 
 More Vikings than Scandinavia, you better watch your behavior 
 I be myself, so I'mma be the self savior 
  
 [Chorus]They say wisdom is the wise words spoken 
 by a brother attempting to open 
 the graves of these mentally dead slaves 
  
 --RZA, "The Birth (Broken Hearts)" 
  
 In this culture, some of the deepest wisdom comes from horror movies. A perfect example is Night of the Living Dead. That movie and its sequels teach you about life. 
      For one thing, Night of the Living Dead predicted the dawn of crack. If you lived in the hood in the '80s, you saw that movie come to life in the street. There's a reason Public Enemy titled that song "Night of the Living Baseheads." 
      Secondly, Dawn of the Dead was the great metaphor for American society. The zombies were Americans, just walking through the mall, lost, trying to find excitement outside of themselves. They forgot that excitement is not buying a new TV; it's taking your shoes off and walking in the grass in your backyard. All those movies were really showing us ourselves. 
      When I first saw Night of the Living Dead, I was scared to death. But when I watched it again at age sixteen (when they were up to Day of the Dead), I'd gotten knowledge of myself, and could relate to what it was saying about America. The dead were alive but they were blind, deaf, and dumb. So to me, they were symbolic of black men in America. 
      The dead in those movies are alive--that's just a description of physical matter, it's active--but they don't have life. Life comes when you have knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, when you can see for real, touch and feel for real, know for real. Then you are truly living. 
      Finally, all the Of the Dead films work as metaphors for the Five Percent. The survivors are holdouts living among the mentally dead. And interestingly, they tend to be led by black men. At the same time, though, after the black man survives--he fights off destruction through the whole movie--a white man kills him.[RZA] 
 Yo, sting of the dragon master, one blow make your jaw shatter 
 Have you walk around with your face wrapped in plaster 
 Gaspin'....... *gasp*, like you got a bad case of asthma 
 Spot the dog, you try to run faster 
 Wild savage, but he bow down to his master 
 Washed beef with an ice cold shaster, he would shout 
  
 [Chorus: RZA] 
 I am free from you, so unleash me 
 There's nothin' else you can do to teach me 
 Nothin' else you can do to appease me 
 I know this point in life, it wouldn't be easy 
 I gave you my all, I would eat food 
 Out of cans, through my hands and all 
 Just to show and prove, you my man's and all 
 Didn't even try to make plans at all 
  
 [Prodigal Sunn] 
 My hand's cut in the outer, leakin' the contender 
 Hit 'em high, stick 'em low, break through the center 
 Somebody screamin' ambulance, yo, he bend a 
 Ghost like a ninja, whole 'nother agenda 
 Catch me day and night, ready for fight 
 Plus I spit more through the mic, four fist right 
 Chest, head, body blow, would leave, anything goes 
 Broken nose, shatterin' jaws, spark him with the C-4 
 P-Sunn did it from the east door 
 The more I tour, the more I score, watch the lion roar 
 Through the field, with the skills and agility 
 Martial art ability, bend the laws of gravity 
 Stay in shape, no cavities 
 Some wise words from a young one, trained to reach mastery 
  
 [Chorus: RZA] 
 I am free from you, so unleash me 
 There's nothin' else you can do to teach me 
  
 [Christ Bearer] 
 I am free from you, Buddhapest fist, Tai Chi, Kung Fu 
 Master siku, jujitsu, round house kick you 
 Forty elbows, then I left right hit you 
 Master set me free, although you'll never let me get the master key 
 Cause when it's time for beef, who could the master be 
 While I'm stopped, critique you see the master flee 
 But cats keep rushin', I'll back flip bust you 
 Crack your rib cage apart, snatch your heart, that's nothin' 
 Guillotine chop, to the Phillipine hot 
 Leave 'em worst, and sendin' them to Killa, get shot 
 I ate from my hands, and ate from the plan 
 Entranced, my face was a glance 
 I gave you my all, I know you felt my slave to, and thought 
 I'm sittin' fool on y'all 
  
 [Chorus 2X][Intro: Understanding (RZA)] 
 Explosive mic Bobby trap rap books 
 The game isn't over, til the kings go wild 
 A brilliant virtuous doctor, in the 21st century (hahahahahahaha) 
 Experiments with a strange potion, called Digital Elixir (hahahahahahaha) 
 That transforms him, into a powerful being 
 That struggles with the great and evil within himself (hohohohohoho) 
 While saving the lives of others 
 Another classic tale of the dangers and benefits of drugs (huh... he's back! 
 Ahh!) 
  
 [RZA] 
 Yo, double dose of danger, it's the Gunfighter and the Stranger 
 Peep the silver bullets, like the old Lone Ranger 
 Transform on ya'll niggas, like the Werewolf from London 
 My cousin Dirty Dick Don, yeah he straight out the dungeon 
 Man up in the art gall', my girl, my newborn child 
 God chosen, son, we just sip from the Nile 
 Gold plated dinner dishes, fresh slice of fresh papaya 
 Pulled by the scrolls, read the Book of Obadiah 
 Smack ya head against the wall like a Spalding 
 My thugs, they carry more drugs than Walgreen's 
 Mr. Digital, bodododo, sometimes appear invisible 
 Got this money, now my old bitch is miserable 
 Old Jack Nicholson grin, I stay sinister 
 Two billion dollar advance, for a three letter signature 
 Holy frankincense and myrrh...

 The body is a vehicle for the mind 
 You realize that your body, is basically vacumnin that space 
 Into somethin from within this body 
 This is why the air must come in, every breath 
 Look at - I say look at ODB, okay 
 A free man for real, knahmsayin? 
 His his expression of freedom, his what he wanted to do 
 It was VERY free, one out of a million people 
 Could deter him, from an idea, y'knahmean? 
 Cause he was free to express like that, y'knahmean?[Intro: RZA] 
 You know they say 
 In every man's life, there comes a time 
 When you get struck by the arrow of cupid 
 By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman 
 Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life 
 And it brings the storm, sing about it 
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 There is more to love than this 
 Love is more than just a kiss 
 Will we take you to that step 
 Will we do more than just connect 
 And will you, bring the thunder in my life 
 And the fire in my eyes 
 Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and 
 Everything far will be so near 
  
 [Hook: Xavier Naidoo] 
 I have never felt thunder (thunder) 
 And lighting (lightning) like this 
 I have never been struck by (struck by) 
 A wonder (a wonder) like this 
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 Ich koennte tagelang von dir erzaehlen 
 Ohne deinen Namen auch nur einmal zu erwaehnen 
 Unter Schmerzen oder unter Traenen 
 Wuerde dein Name als meine Linderung dienen 
 Jede deiner Bewegungen sind erstrebenswert 
 Und jede Stunde mit dir ist so lebenswert 
 Nichts ist vergleichbar mit dem was du gibst 
 Mit dem was zeigst und wie du lebst, wie du liebst 
  
 [Chorus 4x] 
 Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts 
 Das so schoen ist wie Du 
 [Xavier Naidoo] 
 Schoene Tage mit dir sind kostbar 
 So kostbar wie der Weg zum Morgenstern 
 Ich zelebriere sie wie einen Festtag 
 An dem ich immer wieder neues von dir lern' 
 Im Moment ist es das Schoenste dich zu kennen 
 Dich zu kennen ist wie das Beste was ich hab' 
 Verzeih mir aber dieses sag ich nochmal: 
 Deinen Namen zu nennen ist wohl das Schoenste, was ich sag 
  
 [Chorus 4x][Produced by RZA] 
  
 [Verse 1: Robert Delong] 
 I'm looking down on planet Earth 
 I got a message from the universe 
 But I can't communicate up here 
 With the [?] people shouting far and near 
  
 You got everything 
 Cause you can't feel a thing 
 Yeah you got everything 
 But you can't feel a thing 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And I'm just here to make some noise 
 I've got thousands of dollars and electronic toys 
 I'll make a bee to make you sting 
 I'll write a song that you cannot help but sing 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1] 
 So I got everything 
 But I can't feel a thing 
 Yeah I got everything 
 But I can't feel a thing 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 And I got everything 
 But I can't feel a thing 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 They're looking up from planet Earth 
 They ask me how the fuck I get my amnesty from work 
 They know I live inside a cage 
 My mind creates an anchor for perception's sake 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2] 
 Where we feel everything 
 Where we see everything 
 Where I am everything 
 Yeah I am everything 
  
 [Chorus 2 x4] 
 Yeah I am everything 
 Yeah I am everything{*sampled woman singing "So High" in background

 Christians say that you can study all day 
 Pray all day, and chant all day 
 But you get to heaven faster 
 If you hang with the wise men 
 Yeah I would say once you got inspired spark 
 Y'know, you strive, to, y'know 
 You gotta put, y'know you gotta keep puttin wood on it as they say 
 Right? Keep it burnin or whatever 
 You gotta find a way to keep it burnin 
 But then there's the optimum side of it 
 That's the burnin fire that's burnin but it don't burn 
 Knahmean? Just in life, like the sun 
 You know the sun is seen, like that 
 But it's like a eternal sun that 
 That it is on regardless, you just on 
 You just free from, y'know 
 Shit don't work on you no more 
 The story of the villain[Intro: Beretta 9 (RZA)] 
 Drip, drip 
 It's hot outside man (drop, drop) One, two 
 I know niggas is +Thirsty+ (boodoodoodooodoodoo)

 And niggas is +Thirsty+ (Di-Di-Di-Digital) 
  
 [Beretta 9 (RZA)] 
 Ayo, this I dedicate to niggas who bust guns 
 All my live niggas who sold Vamps and didn't +Run+ 
 My juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew 
 A build upon life and drink beers like their pops do 
 A subject of the streets, yo kid it's +Burning Season+ 
 Don't expose the joint without intentional reason 
 Summer time (Digital), dehydrated, niggas out to quench thirst 
 Quench thirst, we might want to stay in home, oh fuck it 
 Rock the camo', I got the ammo 
 A long shot, look like I play for the Knicks 
 So call me Rambo, Beretta 9, Killarm' recon' (Digital) 
 Rob me, I might rob you, then it be on 
  
 [RZA] 
 Digital... 
 Radical +White Boy+ push skate board, not Mountain Dew 
 Old splash, d'ya see that bright yellow shirt with the Wu W? 
 Faced you with the flight of a butter fly wing 
 Fierce as the eagle, sting of the underground beatle 
 Might wobble or fall down inside the squabble 
 In summer time, cracked the ice cold bottle 
 Take the swallow, and give all praises due to the true 
 And do the Dew, just do the Dew, do the Dew...[RZA] 
 Yeah 
 Shake your funky ass, bitch 
 Yaknowmean...

 Up in the skyscrape, on top of the world 
 Back yourself against the wall, gun brawl 
 Kid, I end it for all ya'll (Shake that cake bitch) 
 Son'll stop the dough from flowin 
 Spotless rock glowin, shots are blowin 
 Pop the c-lock, rollin waistline and Glock is showin 
 We keep it thugged out, who not knowin get your knot blown in 
 [RZA] 
 Yo yo 
 Bob Digital and Kool G Rap, we set the booby trap 
 African wiz wit the gat inside her dooby wrap 
 Derelict rhyme crabs, you rappin for a Scooby Snack 
 Foul-tongued bitch, you bound to lick my doody crack 
 Verbal pellets spray, tec sound makes my amex 
 Every slap on my snare drum son could break necks 
 You get yanked up and spanked up, your face shanked up 
 Who the FUCK raise your rank up? 
 I blow your tank up, pop the lock on a cop handcuff 
 Puff a dutch of dust, bust the jump' up and snuff out the judge 
 Fuck a cell block, black top capsule, the mailbox 
 It's heavy-bone birds stash Glock in the nailshop 
 One the strip, took a sip, twist the L top 
 The God jewels son sound like a third rail shock 
 The gold crossbone, doorag, universal flag 
 Blast at the turbo charge and purple herbal drag 
 Known for the W, carry a double-two in the shoe 
 Iron snub rubber noose in the bubble goose 
 Bullets soaked in oil, hot heat will flame broil 
 Wu-Tang slang I bang makes your brain coil 
 Shaolin gods we known to stack cakes 
 Desert Queen projects son, they bake cakes 
 Uptown Pilan dogs, you make cakes 
 Cold Medina sons, they known to take cakes 
 [Kool G Rap] 
 Yo, we have the Wu-Tang, we let two's bang 
 That's how we do thangs, that's how we move thangs 
 Shoes paid wit two in the brain 
 Keep the ice blue in the Range 
 Me and The RZ' quick wit two of them dames 
 Got my dick blew in the Range 
 My nigga keep it true to the game 
 It ain't no tellin what I do to you lames 
 If my mood change, choose to aim 
 Do you and your dudes the same 
 Go against grain and lose a fame 
 Who claim life in the thug lane but life is real 
 Lead come out of pipes of steel 
 Rob, kill, or heist for mills 
 Spill as I let out and slice your grill 
 Nigga don't think twice to peel 
 Just open shop and dice to grill 
 Send the six out, bust crib route 
 To the brickhouse, steppin on new terrain, bring the click out 
 The streets don't wanna see you read, let a clip out 
 These niggas slip out, make they blood drip out 
 Yo we divide the cakes to rise the stakes 
 Me and my apes die for papes 
 Bust heat and hide from jake 
 Up in the skyscrape, on top of the world 
 Back is up against the wall, gun brawl 
 Kid, I end it for all ya'll 
 The flood'll stop the dough from flowin 
 Spotless rock glowin, shots I'm blowin 
 Pop the c-lock, rollin waistline, the Glock is showin 
 E keep it thugged out, who not knowin get your knot blown in

 Oh whoa, these tears that I've had 
 They here, have no, word 
 Then roll, each time each pain 
 I fell insane 
 [RZA] 
 Fury in my eyes, sword on my side 
 Escape death to become immortalized 
 Afro on my head, the black Samurai 
 Number One, I bring a whole nation alive 
 I'm the leader of the Clan, you can tell from the headband 
 Spirit of God, become one inside man 
 Except all challengers, leave 'em in bandages 
 Sword won't ceist til my enemy vanishes 
  
 [Chorus II: Thea] 
 And so your tables have turned 
 Only now with you and I've burned 
 Were these sweet memories? 
 In the rain 
 [RZA] 
 Yo, I'm the master of disaster, no one swing a sword faster 
 I warned you, the'll be tears after the laughter 
 Now I'm 30 years, after the rapture 
 War blood will be spilt, we start a new chapter 
 Fury in my eyes, sword on my side 
 Afro on my head, I'm a black Samurai 
 Number One, I bring my whole nation alive 
 Escape death, to become immortalized 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Chorus II] 
 [RZA] 
 Yo, yo, dogs out to chase these cats, in the jungle 
 Rats wanna snatch that cheese, in the jungle 
 Bears want honey from bees, in the jungle 
 Birds wanna nest in the trees, in the jungle 
 Squirrels try'nna catch a nut, in this jungle 
 Pigs wild around in the muds, in this jungle 
 Lions on the hunt for the beef, in these jungles 
 Hyena roll around thirty deep, in these jungles 
 Try'nna snatch ice from the penguins, while I'm stingling 
 I see shorty wop, she got those ill rings jingling 
 They jingling, baby, I heard Ringling 
 Barnum & Bailey was in this place, shit is crazy 
 What's a man to do in this jungle? 
 Live life on the hunt full, in the jungle 
 When hamsters come and try to snatch a crumb from you 
 What a man 'pose to do, in this jungle? 
 If you can talk to animals in this jungle 
 Would you allow the slouth to come amongst you 
 Would you break bread, or instead 
 Get the thirty-thirty scope and put one in your head 
 Put one in the head... 
  
 [Chorus II]This is not those two DJ's, not Touch, not Wop 
 Not that skinny bitch Cameron although she's hot 
 Not those brothers Tony, wanted to pop me in that movie 
 Now I'ma claim that name, Diaz, y'all can sue me 
 Any beat given to me, shit, I'll close it down 
 In and out the booth, hot like we supposed to sound 
 Now who holds the crown? Yo let's split it four ways 
 I'm always, gonna be Spain and Norway

 Don't fuck with my money, son, don't fuck with my bitch 
 Don't fuck with my lab and don't fuck with my whip 
 Don't fuck with my jewels, my weed or my dip 
 Or I might get the Glock, son, and fuck with this clip 
 Blast off the Remingtons, steel shots got you tremblin' 
 Runnin' so fast you lost the tree off the Timberland's 
 Flamed from the heat I squeeze, feel the adrenaline 
 And we could bust shots like we cowboys and Indians

 Yo 
 Let the world witness some real shit 'bout to go down

 We break shit down, yo look 
 The God Rzarec' is known breakin' Gucci specs 
 Magnetic attraction to wizzes keep their coochie wet 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'm a super-nova 
 Controller of the lunar and polar, German luger holders 
 Best to back the fuck up, my mag buckin' up 
 The slugs could stop Mack trucks so don't act up 
 Fatal guillotine carrier blast like the space harrier 
 Sip of the blackberry, Berry I might marry ya

 There's a lot of shit that separates y'all from me 
 I'm in touch with the streets, they reply to me 
 If I'm needed by my people there's no why in me 
 A real fighter, maybe there's a young Sly in me 
 I'm like that Spanish Rocky, attitude a bit cocky 
 Me around ya girl, y'all could guess where that cock be 
 Well it's not in my pants, not in my hands 
 Y'all could look at it like, I make her hot in advance

 Gravitation pull to the opposite sex 
 Most dynamic superb universal black woman 
 Ain't nothin' in the universe like a black woman 
 With love and treasure deeper than any gold nugget 
 Drug kid, make you go across a nigga head like Razor Ruddock 
 Attackin' y'all, my pressure be backin' y'all against the wall 
 Have it rainin' Ninja Starz and rubbin' alcohol 
 And razor blades, watch your life fade away 
 You get decay, yo.. BOODOODOODOO

 One came to be a star, one came to play hookey 
 One came to catch a vic, one came to stick shit[instrumental for 40 seconds]

 Let's say you say look at someone old like statues 
 See Buddha, you see laughing Buddha, you see the crying Buddha 
 You see a sleeping Buddha, you see the tall Buddha 
 You see the Buddha... you see the female Buddha 
 You see all these different, variations 
 These are all different kind of personalities 
 Or different kind of ways that they have reached the light 
 You can laugh yourself into the light 
 You got the drunken Buddha, I mean the drunk monk 
 Y'knahmean? That's why you can drink yourself into enlightenment 
 But the side effects of whatever you doin, y'knahmean? 
 Is gonna determine how long you're gonna enjoy your enlightenment[RZA] 
 If the 85 are in the sheep state of mind, right? 
 They still B-rain in the sheep state of mind 
 It's just, which way are you leadin the sheep? 
 Off the cliff?

 And have a full productive life?D12 
 The Underground EP 
 Derelict Theme 
  
 [Kon Artis] 
 I damage your neck 
 With the butt of the tech 
 Vandalous sex 
 Cuttin' you ear to ear 
 With the razor of my Gillette 
 You couldn't get respect 
 If you was a captain or a cadet 
 Granddaddy, daddy, or uncle who's a Vietnam vet 
 I'll battle you 50 deep 
 Solo artist shocker dead beat 
 Derelicts on the loose 
 Wylin' like thugs outta prison with slugs 
 While y'all start screaming 
 Like grasses in a submission 
 (Lay down your pot to piss in) 
 Blow up the house you live in 
 Believe me, we greedy 
 And often you is easy 
 Your whole album cheesy 
 Because you got platinum artists on it 
 Don't make it hot 
 We steamroll with real niggas 
 And that's something that you not 
 I'm vampin what you got 
 Then setting up camp at your spot 
 Foiling your plot 
 Every rhyme that you jot 
 I rock to the six like musty twat 
 A dead corpses that been cut up 
 And left in abandoned lots 
 Ya, derelicts theme 
 Comparing your team 
 To ours is a fucked up dream 
 The shit I done seen 
 Has turned me to a scandalous fiend 
 Sticking your peeps for cream 
 Gators or boots, nigga, I'm crushing your dreams 
 As foul as it seems 
 Dismantling spleens til your whole clique's 
 Walking funny like handicapped juggling teams 
 I rumble with kings 
 More humble with seen 
 Until it's time for me to kill again 
 Sincerely yours, the Kon Artis 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ay yo 
 Competition of none's such 
 Derelicts the one must 
 Let the guns bust 
 Brigade one trust 
 Untouched 
 Martyr a mic 
 Slaughter your life 
 Runnin avenue soldiers bitch 
 It's water and trife 
 Competition ain't none such 
 Derelicts the one must 
 Let the guns bust 
 It's Brigade one trust 
 Untouched 
 Martyr a mic 
 Slaughter your life 
 Runnin' avenue soldiers bitch 
 Smarter and trife 
  
 [Bizarre] 
 Who's the fat bastard 
 Rapping that mo' master 
 Snorting coke that's whiter than Casper 
 Better run faster 
 I can out-smoke all of you motherfuckers 
 And bitch I was born with asthma 
 Fuck life, I'd rather track Jack Daniels 
 Smoke weed and rape Cockerspaniels 
 A peeping Tom, nigga I need Ridalin 
 Fuck girls 
 Bitch I only date senior citizens 
 Your grandma, nigga I'm the one that vic'd her 
 Next time you rush me 
 You better be a little bit quicker 
 Run your streets in the house 
 And make full of malt liquor 
 I'm lettin' you throw the first blow 
 And bring ten of your toughest niggas 
 End ya year 
 Like the last day of December 
 (But did you rape that bitch?) 
 I was so drunk I can't remember 
 I used to be in a group 
 We had an argument who was the hottest 
 Now both them niggas is dead 
 And I roll as a solo artist 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Kuniva] 
 Look bitch you stressed out 
 I divide these bullets equally among your crew 
 And give you five so you don't feel left out 
 Like red the hammer 
 I'm nailing niggas in they spleens 
 Just to make walking again a sympathetic dream 
 Energetic schemes 
 Rap vandal and dismantle 
 Tackle MC's and wax you 
 Like your rap name was Candle 
 Grabbing a mic with no handles 
 Leaving you dusty 
 Like walking the desert in old sandals 
 If you weeded or drunk 
 Keep your heat in your trunk 
 We beat you to lumps 
 Swell you up with permanent mumps 
 We dangerous playa 
 Cuffin' my chews 
 Spittin the phlegm out 
 Getting at you whether you coming out 
 Or you been out 
 You never exempt 
 From this murderous attempt 
 I'm telling you pimp 
 Undeniably you are a loss 
 Invincible, why you trying to be a mind boss 
 If the Kon Artis say it then it's done 
 With or without a gun 
 Eat a track and spit out a drum 
 Bust one 
 Trust none 
 Playing the game of death 
 Take your last breath 
 'Til your last name is left 
  
 ChorusYo, yo, yo, yo Bobby 
 What up, what up? I can't really hear you 
 Aiyo, I left ten pounds in the trunk and I gave Sha' ten 
 Make sure he drops them shits off 
 I'm on my way back to Mexico to pick up another hundred 
 Can you hear me? Can you hear me? 
 Yo make the drop off, don't forget man 
 Yo, I got niggas on the block, block 
 Niggas with them gats, gats 
 Niggas on the strip, strip 
 Puffin' them packs, packs 
 To my workers that stays sharp like razors 
 Play my part and blaze it, we braveheart with paper 
 My niggas got that Dutch, Dutch 
 Niggas got that black, black 
 Niggas got a bitch, bitch, head in they lap, lap 
 My team ain't wit' it, we dreamed and did it 
 Leaned and pivot, schemed for digits 
 Everything you seen, we lived it 
 Nigga front then we get at duke 
 Dick hard like statues go to hole like Shaq do 
 I cut you like a cantelope 
 Like Iverson the truth and the answer 
 I'm the poison and the antidote 
 Don't care if the bitch cute, we don't sex raw 
 We play the corners like the castles on a chess board 
 Up in the Lex 4, drinkin' a Beck's boy 
 Shoppin' in the best stores, I'm the nigga to check for 
 Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed 
 No tattoo on titties sayin', "F R E" 
 And my nigga Crizzee baby, and my nigga Digi baby 
 Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed 
 No tattoo on titties sayin', "Bob Digi" 
 Or ShaCrizzee baby, or Lil' Frizzee baby 
 Bobby, stop 
 Bobby, the cops is comin' 
 That shit is tight girl 
 Hey you 
 Fuck that mothafucka 
 You know how I do 
 Up in the drop-top Boxter headin' the opposite 
 Direction of the cop inside the chopper 
 I got the tall Grey Goose vodka 
 This bitch on my side, with no panties, finger pop her 
 Ten pounds of skunk up in the front trunk 
 Bird like hittin' a blunt, about to cum, and I'm pinchin' her cunt 
 Ninety miles per hour I'm like, "Fuck these punks" 
 It's the land of the free, son, you only live once 
 You a smart motherfucker or stupid dunce? 
 Music blastin', she orgasm like a singer 
 Sweet, wet pussy got all over my fingers 
 Now I'm sniffin' my hand, all sippin' the plan 
 Got the pedal to the floor, goin' swift as I can 
 Hit the exit, chk-chk-chuh, make the left quick 
 Hit the garage and slip inside the Lexus 
 I got many whips, many clips, many chicks 
 And my dick's been sucked by many lips 
 Many tips or many Vicks, many sticks 
 And love to gulp with plenty chips 
 He got many whips, many clips, many chicks 
 And his dick's been sucked by many lips 
 Many tips or many Vicks, many sticks 
 And love to fuck with plenty chips 
 Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed 
 No tattoo on titties, sayin', "F R E" 
 And my nigga Crizzee baby, and my nigga Digi baby 
 Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed 
 No tattoo on titties sayin', "Bob Digi" 
 Or ShaCrizzee baby, or Lil' Frizzee baby(Prince Rakeem talking) 
 Yo here we go yo 
 The Prince Rakeem, this here is called my deadly venom 
 You know what I'm sayin? 
 Some old freestyle type of slick slang 
 For you and your gang 
 Girls so ya'll can kinda sweat this 
 Check it out and ya' don't quit 
  
 Verse 1: 
 And many brothers know me for what? 
 My bag of bitches 
 But I'm also known for giving stitches 
 A buck 50 for those who get nifty 
 That's why your ass so fast to call me swifty 
 And here I go and here I go 
 Hey yo go out like Bo and act like ya' know 
 That ya' can't beat me or bring me 
 The least bit of harm 
 Sssss, um um, uh uh 
 Heck no, I keep a sucker brain petrified 
 When I grab the mic I won't let go, I'd 
 Rather go live forever and ever and ever 
 Let it go? Never 
 Assume a lot of boys are doomed 
 Without being tuned 
 To many many many moons 
 As the champ that blast through your amp 
 I can't get weak cause my style can't cramp 
 I'm rugged like Guess black denim 
 Battles ya'll know I always ran 'em 
 When it comes to rappers, they're seeds 
 I'll plant 'em 
 As I eject ya' wit' a dose of deadly venom 
 This is the way I like to parle 
 And amputate to the words I say 
 The tormentor, take you on a mad adventure 
 Through an episode that's cold like the winter 
 Check your checklist 
 And see if you can wreck this 
 You thought I was a lover 
 And didn't expect this 
 Style I specify but now you can testify 
 Thee not a less the best is I 
 Deadly Venoms 
 Deadly Venoms kid 
 Check it out yo 
  
 Verse 2: 
 No time for charades or masquerades 
 It's more rugged shit with the kid with braids 
 And I like brothers to step up and show what they got 
 And watch 'em drop on the spot 
 And pop the corns 
 Just raw like crumbs from my tongue 
 Cause you're small like Tom Thumb 
 But I'm great, up to date and elevate 
 Rhymes I design 
 I write with paper mate 
 I stimulate your thoughts 
 Can't take shorts 
 Won every battle that I ever fought 
 So friend or foe 
 Who want to go toe to toe? 
 Yo you know you're gonna fall below 
 Zero don't try to play hero 
 Like um, Robert DeNiro and Crazy Shapiro 
 But I exempt not to be a wimp 
 I walk with a limp of a Roscoe pimp 
 I'm a slickster 
 Who's out to get your sister 
 You disagree with me? Fuck you mister 
 So uncanny brothers can't stand me 
 I'll take the panties from your mammy and your granny 
 Rap crusader, bam boom invader 
 Sex capader and also a panty raider 
 So protect your property 
 'Cause when it comes to baggin' girls 
 No one is stopping me 
 Or getting rid of me 
 I'm the epitome 
 Even cold fuck the statue of liberty 
 That's the way that I am though 
 Yea Rakeem wit' a rugged deadly venom (venom) 
 Yea check it the deadly venom (venom) 
 Word, the deadly venom kid 
 Yea a deadly venom (venom) 
  
 Verse 3: 
 Suckers step to me and think they can do me 
 Your style is screwy like Hong Kong Fuey 
 You can't push me, rush or mush me 
 Dust or crush, or even ambush me 
 'Cause I'll play ya' right out of position 
 See through your mission with x-ray vision 
 And once I see ya' I get Scrooge like Ebenezer 
 Crush ya' like black Caesar 
 After that I'll leave ya' 
 Hit 'em wit' a symptom of Rakeem fever 
 You get strung, hung, swung 
 Done, by a witty rap tongue 
 >From a young man who understood 
 What it takes to be good 
 Make a rhyme sound like it should 
 Susa I'm makin' this style looser 
 I turn men to stone like Medusa 
 You get blown and thrown off course 
 Feel the remorse 
 You're forced to take a loss 
 I get crazier 
 Slay ya' like Hell Raiser 
 Style amaze ya' I'm rugged like a trail blazer 
 Then I crash right through your 
 Lyrics I sued 'em 
 They're moving like U-Haul 
 Booming 'em, doing 'em, wrap 'em 
 Like aluminum fo-o-oil 
 Your plans got spoiled 
 Rhymes will affect ya' 
 Who loves to wreck ya'? 
 I laugh in your face like I'm Woody Woodpecker 
 (mocks Woody Woodpecker's laugh) 
 You can't get with the Ra' 
 Deadly venom 
 Word, Know what I'm sayin? 
 The Prince Rakeem strikes again 
 Never hit below the belt although the blow is felt 
 I wanna say peace to the DMD posse 
 And the gladiator posse 
 And the whole Staten Island posse 
 And the funky president Mel Kwan[Chorus: RZA] 
 I'mma beat you down, to the ground 
 I'mma beat you down, fool 
 I'mma beat you down, to the ground 
 I'mma beat you down, dude 
 I'mma put my foot on yo ass 
 I'mma break you down, fool 
 I'mma beat your face with this bat 
 I'mma beat you down, boy 
 I'll beat you down, to the ground 
 I'll beat you down, yo 
 I'll beat you down, to the ground 
 I'll beat you down, fool 
  
 [Reverend William Burke] 
 Yo, dark hallways, dead bodies, it's always 
 Rats and the O'Jays, songs from the old days 
 The Chi got a lotta bitter freeze and cold days 
 Hardly ever went to school, had a lot of snow days 
 Roll wraps on slow days, and it didn't take long 
 Before I figured out, these hoes pays 
 My uncle put me on, stuck, in his old ways 
 Leaving suckers shook, stuck, in them old graves 
 Ya'll know the repertoire, I got the peddle to the metal 
 Like a rebel, and I know just where the weapons are 
 Ghetto superstar, pushing a super car 
 A.M.G., C.L.K., C-Allah 
 Limousines, DVD's, TV's, bar 
 S.U.V.'s, O.G.'s who travel far 
 Black on black, double R, we hustle, pa 
 Stumble hard, bubble double on the boulevard 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Young Dirty Bastard] 
 Freestyle king, top I'm going soar 
 I'm polishing off with a blood damn saw 
 Feed it to your tongue, you ain't hungry no more 
 Keep stabbing ya, until your jaw's ripped out 
 No mouth piece, nigga, your teeth is knocked out 
 I'mma keep swinging, I'mma keep swinging 
 I'mma keep dinging, I'mma keep stinging, ahhh 
 Jumping on the walls, spider never falls 
 Lighters in the air, writing on walls 
 I'mma beat you down, like you stole something from me 
 Cousing Sha might put something in your tummy!!! 
  
 [Chorus][Ad lib: RZA] 
 Yo, exclusive (exclusive) 
 (I'm inside the motherfucking refrigerator) 
 J.. J-Love 
  
 [Intro: RZA] 
 Yo, it makes no sense 
 Why the fuck is y’all niggas so dense? 
 Trying to jump the fence 
 You trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents 
 Like this nigga Flint, he had no fucking sense 
  
 [Verse 1: RZA] 
 Trying to disrespect the Prince, make a hit like Bucky Dent 
 Money clip clenched, all his dollars and cents 
 Wouldn't give a dime to a wench 
 Even though catching cream was a sinch 
 From still penny pinch on the park bench 
 Holding his nine inch tight as a wrench 
 Bent til’ his eye squint 
 FZA-FZA-FZA-Flusty from the dust, you could smell the stench 
 Money green cream from wintergreen mints 
 Spent his time in limousines, slightly tint 
 Wherever he went, cause an incident 
 With 10 henchmen jumping outta doors, suspension Lincoln 
 Ready for lynching any competition, thinking 
 They could catch him while he be drinking 
 Big niggas be shrinking when he come through 
 A major player, said he was the Alpha and Omega 
 But still slipped the 40 ounce from the local bodega 
 Wait…wait, this fucker, Money Talk like Chris Tucker 
 Bitch stuck a shoe game like Miss Rucker 
  
 [Chorus x2: RZA] 
 Never give your gun to a friend 
 'Cause he’ll never bring it over again 
 Never leave your ho alone 
 With your dog, 'cause he might try to bury his bone 
  
 [Verse 2: Free Murda] 
 What’s this O talk about, she used to have blocks 
 I don’t wanna hear about ya man crack spots 
 I don’t wanna hear about that van with black Glocks 
 About 102 of us like the dogs wit’ the black dots 
 Better keep ya mind and ya hand on that stashbox 
 We rolled up with more cars than that Matchbox 
 Pop one right in ya chat box, niggas don’t wanna gatbox 
 They wan’ chatbox, my gat cocked 
 Have niggas taking up back blocks 
 Can’t walk through the middle 'cause they talk just a little 
 Too much, niggas want more than a little 
 That’s too much, for a draw, send a dog to his kennel 
 He boozed up, like a plumber, keep my tools up 
 I’m icy, the R.L. Stine, I got the Goosebumps 
 Got hit in the head, that’s how he dumbfounded 
 Got hit so much he thought he was surrounded 
 Now I’m lounging, been had them thousands 
 Free stack more bricks than a project housing 
 My guns make Five Hearts Beat, like Robert Townsend 
 I be five cars deep, right in ya town, son 
 Talking all slick ’til I send that kite 
 He ain’t “Three’s Company”, pumping Nicks at Nite 
 We ain’t need company, we got chicks at night 
 Niggas need company 'cause we got fifths at night (blaow!) 
  
 [Chorus x2: RZA] 
 Never give your gun to a friend 
 'Cause he’ll never bring it over again 
 Never leave your ho alone 
 With your dog, 'cause he might try to bury his boneGet your gun 
 Yo yo, it's a samurai showdown, samurai showdown 
 Aight, DZA, how dare you challenge me? 
 You will die from the tip of my sword today 
 The trenches, we must remain calm 
 Right, prepare to die 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, yo, hailin' from the slums of Shaolin, golden claw 
 Talon twirl and one swirl of the fatal sword splits your Island 
 Wu killa bees stingers back on the swarm again 
 The alarm again, six direction weapon deflection 
 Bones connect like opposite sides of magnets 
 Steel fragments bein' chipped off a singing sword slash 
 With the force of big crash in your dash board with no airbag 
 He drove a ninety nine Jaguar quick to pick a lock 
 Lick a shot, respect the bloods and crips a lot 
 Plus the God from ride saggin' in his seat 
 Blastin' wu beats tryin' to plot his next hit 
 He took a drag of the eight elements that composed 
 Atmospheric gas, 'bout to let off his sword 
 And full blast kept his mind focused, meditation position half lotus 
 Abbot's sword novas couldn't match his magnum opus deluxe strok 
 Son move like a ghost, struck in an instance 
 Unnoticed like a lamp post, radar sharp precision gunfire 
 Explode till his clips unload, it's a samurai code 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Time for everyone to go accord 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Time for everybody to go accord 
 Crept in silent, the steel wind, chrome silencers screwed on tight 
 Kept the gunshots just sealed in, we attack, full fledge 
 With Chicago Bull red bandanas tied tight around our heads swing 
 With the force of a sledge, single-edge stainless steel blade 
 Chopped the wedge, slit this analog derelicts head 
 Who even thought that he could go against the truth and the Gods 
 And fall back from the will of Allah, you'll be facin' the firing squad 
 Of a thousand archers out to mark ya 
 The bill top scully king blocks bullest like jelly beans 
 Birds in my nest restin up on the telly scene 
 Murderous rap track to me, is ego felony can't accept? 
 What you analog cats be tellin' me, I get the verbal weapon 
 Won't hesitate for one second to break your back 
 Like big jack from tekken 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young Lord, raise your swords"Take the sword" 
 "The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword" 
 "Huh?" 
 "Heh, you Wu-Tang are never gonna win" 
 "My lord, don't be afraid of the Wu-Tang techniques" 
 "Pick up the sword!" 
  
 Yo, aiyo, chumps are in trouble, boy, tongue pay double, boy 
 I'm trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy 
 I leave you ducks in a puddle, buried under cuz of rubble 
 Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles 
 Hot lead from the cylinder, from my two-shot dillinger 
 Put that hot steel in ya, bigger not feeling ya 
 Bio hazard, to ya flesh and ya fabric 
 No need to scratch your hair, son, the clean to my static 
 Strange apparatus and gadgets, my bullets got magnets 
 Pop pop pop, we attract to that crab shit 
 Super superior stamina, there's a Clan of us 
 All of what bulldozers, hard hats and jack hammers 
 And leather Old Testament copies, I'll probably 
 Give you a out of body experience, then hide your body 
 So there's no return, so burn, baby, burn 
 My click fucking sick, nigga, learn, baby, learn 
 I got Milwaukee chicks like Shirley and Laverne 
 They bite ya dick off, after swallowing your sperm 
 And slice ya fucking throat while you lay there in sperm 
 They related to the judge, to the case, to the germ 
 You chumps are in trouble, boy, I said tongue pays double, boy 
 I"m trump tight, you better go home, and cuddle, boy 
 I put your head in a puddle, buried under cuz of rubble 
 Turn your body, to sparks and stubbles 
 Frickles and fragles, nigga, get too fragile 
 Pump the fuck up, my brain, is on Scrabble 
  
 Aiyo, back for this annual conference, confronted on 
 You wack MC's, it's duck season, the hunt is on 
 What B9 squeezing and game is locked, a run upon 
 Thinking that you were the shit, nah, that's once upon 
 I doubt my run while you sit, I bust my gun from the hip 
 Why even make you a song, and when you ain't worth a skit 
 My niggas kill for the sum, and the'll be cursed for the flick 
 Probably til midnight until, scheeming on pussy to split 
 And then we back like crack, nigga, take a swig of that 
 Twist a twenty sack of black, figure, oh he a good kid 
 Such a nice smile he had, oh one more state 
 Then I whip it on that, slip slipping in the grass 
 Sip sipping on the glass, now I'm dipping down the ave 
  
 "Take the sword" 
 "The sword?" 
 "Come on, give me the sword" 
 "Huh?" 
 "Heh, you Wu-Tang are never gonna win" 
 "My lord, don't be afraid of the Wu-Tang techniques"Bobby? Bonsoir, tu es là? 
 Enfin, je t'attendais toute la soirée 
 Viens pres de moi, contre moi 
 Embrasse moi, caresse moi 
 Je sais que tu as envie de moi 
  
 Je sais que, on pourrait etre proches 
 Bobby Digital, tu es merveilleux 
 J'ai envie de toi, tout de suite, maintenant 
 Plus pret encore, encore dans l'oreille, encore pret du corps 
 On pourrait parler toute la soirée 
 Si tu as envie de moi 
 Si tu as seulement une petite envie 
 Comme j'ai envie de toi 
 S'il te plait, encore contre toi

 Prevent that, find ya self in a tight squeeze now

 It's all about C's now, too many MC's now 
 Please now listen, I'm takin somebodys place 
 Fuck who that be, ya'all cats can't hold it like me 
 Though I'm not from no famous, borough or state 
 I've spent years in this shit, more than eight 
 I'm more than great, I cross more borders than weight 
 I serve you 24/7, ya'all can order this shit late 
 And choose the language too, just go ahead 
 You want norwegian or the spanish row instead 
 Toma, para los que pueren entender (Spanish) 
 Til de som str og ler, vi fr bent dem ner (norwegian)

 [Diaz] 
 Heard ya'all Mc's talk alot, let's get back to this 
 I dont know if ya know this, but ya facts are twist 
 Up and coming motherfuckers just act as if 
 What they need to learn about is what practice is 
 Ya'all should get a teacher, who you lack is Chris 
 It be funny to see how you react to this 
 I'm like that +Activist+, I run up with bombs 
 While screamin 'fuck rap', with C-4 in both palms 
 I keep spittin after I blew off both arms 
 RZA came through, I'm used to flow over tarms 
 Beef that is, I'm tryin to reach these kids 
 Go head to head with these labels, beat their bids 
 Do whatever it taes, I never shit slide 
 Bout to switch on they ass like Jekyll to Hyde 
 Nobody takes me for a ride, put it to side 
 That's not an option, time for me to go outside 
 Hard to knock loose, cool with that much pride 
 God's my witness, I dont got too much to hide 
 That wasent the truth, Virgin Mary would I cry? 
 Peeped it with closed gates and I've would've fried 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We like to get, get high 
 Smoke, smoke, lah, lah 
 Trees, and feel the breeze 
 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

 And start the squeeze, 16 shots at you crab MC'z 
 Nigga, we can get high, high 
 Chase ????, chop

 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

 And squeeze 16 at you ????? rappers wanna touch my team

 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea 
 {*airplane takes off*}[Intro: RZA] 
 We at the Downtown Cabinay, right across the street from the Coca Cobana 
 We have the midnight roof special going on 
 We have Choco on the wheels of steel 
 Slow it down for a minute Choco 
 Yo, Zig Zag on the M.I.C 
 We givin' a special tribute to Charlie Parker, here tonight 
 The midnight rooftop special 
 We gon' bring it like this, I want all ladies 
 Who came with their men, come on in 
 Get into sweety, and drink all night 
  
 [RZA] 
 Bebop, we walk with our hats on tilt 
 Pink and white silk, made of shoes on stilts 
 Dressed as the morning milk, plus, like the quilt 
 When we rock at the club, no blood got spilt 
 Where dime piece wizes, had they legs in the air 
 From being sprung by the swings, so they legs in the air 
 Long dresses, and they silk brassiere 
 Ya'll unloosen the twist, Rob came in the air 
  
 [Chorus 4X: RZA] 
 I rock the bebop, the bebop, the bebop 
 The bud-bud-a-budda-bidda bebop, bebop, somebody don't bopped bopped 
  
 [RZA] 
 The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave 
 Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker 
 From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop 
 Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot 
 From pull to press, not white and up tight 
 To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass up right 
 To having our crowns polished, and our face up right 
 To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right 
  
 [Chorus 4X] 
  
 [Interlude: RZA] 
 So we still groovin' wit it 
 Keepin' the flow poppin' here 
 We gon' turn the lights down a little low 
 Just hide the identity, yo, yo 
  
 [RZA] 
 The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave 
 Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker 
 From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop 
 Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot 
 From pull to press, not white and up tight 
 To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass that's up right 
 To having our crowns polished, and our face up right 
 To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right

 Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to O-Ren Ishii 
 We gonna bring it like this, down, yo 
 One-two, it's called the Ode to O-Ren Ishii, aiyo 
  
 [RZA] 
 This is an ode to O-Ren Ishii 
 Half Chinese/half Japane-see, half American 
 Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection 
 She had the sinister cat eyes, with the freckles on her complexion 
 Chief of the Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa 
 And she had Crazy 88 killers, *chka-ka* that'll slice right through ya 
 Quick to chop your head off, then wipe the blood off 
 A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off 
 You got a minute to pray and a second to die 
 You see the devil reflectin' inside of her eye 
 But since she was a little girl, she never would cry 
 She seen so much pain and tragedy, I'll explain to you why 
 She grew up on the military base, where she had to face 
 Her mother, and her father being sadly erased 
 The blood drop from her tear drops, on her face, you seen the smear spots 
 She silently watched, as the shogun sliced through her dear pops 
 Through his thick skull, now she's vicious like a pitbull 
 And when it comes to hatred, and revenge?? 
 *SSSS-SSS* Ahh, man, she got a shit full 
 O-Ren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see, half American 
 Oh what a specie... Cottonmouth.., revenge is a thesis 
 She been bustin' off kneecaps, since the age of eleven 
 But fuckin' the enemy to death, that was her favorite weapon 
 And the debt you paid in hell, can't be paid in heaven 
 You better get on your knees, and started praying to the reverend 
 Bon appetit, boy, revenge is so sweet 
 Especially on a cold dish, she has no wish 
 But to cut your day short, like the winter solstice 
 And a chance to receive mercy from her, was hopeless 
 O-Ren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see 
 Half American, muaww, and oh, what a species[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA] When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar [Ol' Dirty Bastard] When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar Own family will kill ya, damn it be a skrilla Box of bullets in flavors, like Mike & Ike Friday night, I'm in the bed, with a bitch and a dyke Ol' Dirty, 7:30, got the thirty-thirty Caught a mouscope, ain't aimin' at no birdie My name plate, travel through the interstate Glock in the stash box, my drop top ventilate Permanent A.C., use to boost at Macy's Smoke out Mr. Spacely, and still Dick Tracy I blind dunk a base, make ya chest inflate I'm at the herb gate, watch my money bake Disrespect me, where I lay my head, my hammer spray My cybertech nylon suit, reflect gamma ray When I speak, ears open to the size of cymbal Make you tremble, watch what the fuck my gun do [Chorus] [Ol' Dirty Bastard] A moment to pray, a second to die Take your hard ride with the bulletproof high Nigga, check ya logic, Ol' Dirty's out the closet I return you niggas for a five percent deposit Beer belly, I chuckle like Kris Kringle Put four grams of cocaine, crushed up in the single Everyday is Saturday, everyday my gats play When shit get bad, I'm looking for a badder way Ol' Dirt McGirt, in concert the bomb burst To set it off, shoot him in the arm, first Let him off? Nah, kidnap his mom, first Told you, when things get worst, nigga, things get worst Cats be saddling, when the gats splattering Ol' Dirt, caught one through the lower abdomen Straight through the back, like the javelin Word, son, it had to been, still here, battling [Chorus 2X]Yeah, yeah 
 Dans l'monde 
 Comme aux premires rencontres 
 On finira seul au poste de lui 
 Qui a pour contre 
 The maker, the owner 
 The creator of the planet Earth 
 And the father of civilization 
 The god of the Universe 
 Dans l'monde 
 Comme aux premires rencontres 
 On finira seul au poste de lui 
 Qui a pour contre 
 Allah is the one 
 Never gonna find 
 Another like that nowhere 
 Seul au poste de lui

 J'sais qui va are'tentir avant d'repentir lors do dernier round 
 Un sac de croix sur l'dos j'affronte 
 Ces foudres prt en dcoudre 
 Tout blanc vtu, moi le sale noir, l'esprit nue 
 Seul sur le ring sous le sol spacial, entends la cloche fatale 
 Quand les anges ont la dale, see'est mieux qu'un blanc qui sale 
 Ca fait un bail que j'danse avec l'espoir 
 Faut que j'sorte do btail o j'traine ma vie animale 
 Outre les raisons, seul dans les choix et actions 
 Et trop de souvenirs en tte, est-je pris les bonnes dcisions? 
 See'est dans la pulsion souvent qu'jai choisi la friction 
 Mais bon Franchement ya des cons sur 
 Terre qui mritent sanction 
 Et tout ce que j'aurais pu dire et faire, ouais je sais j'espre 
 Veinement qu'les impairs why'a que moi qui va devoir les payer 
 Et j'ai bien essayer, tu peux me rayer d'ta liste si a t'plais 
 Et si tu laisses en fait les mmes parfaits 
 Ton peuple il va faire les jets 
 Ni l'moins bon, ni l'meilleur vcu cent l'heure 
 La peur sur le front 
 Le coeur qui fait front comme mon pre le fit 
 L'Nez coll l'envie, j'ai fais ce qui fallait 
 J'te le dis en face, see'tait ca ou m'affol 
 On peut pas toute sa vie cavaler au campement 
 Rmy dsol, je suis see'que j'ai fais 
 Et si see'est pas see'qui fallait 
 Seigneur fallait pas m'provoquer 
 Hey hey, seul face lui 
 Dans la vie la mort, on s'donne 
 Pas de fausses tonnes 
 Tout s'chelonne pour finir quand l'heure sonne 
 La grce reste le prt, see'est pas le souci dans la zone 
 Je sais d'o vienne mes chromosomes 
 Devant la question ternelle d'lhomme Qui nous sommes? 
 Dis leur qu'on est le peuple d'celui qui a croqu la pomme 
 On finira par un dcompte 
 Au del d'l'univers et ca le monde le sait 
 L o la vie est cadenasse, Pre 
 On sera seul face lui 
 You can't escape fate 
 Allah be the maker 
 Bow down to your creator 
 Tout seul face lui 
 Put your wicked heart on the scale 
 You melt like a snow flake in hell 
 Seul face lui 
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
 No disgiue, no alibis and no lies 
 Tout seul face lui 
 You realize every breath you took 
 It came from the most High 
 Ma premire clope, j'lai fum en traitre 
 D'une traite, dans une punbre 
 J'ai mme pas aim, quelle merde 
 Pourquoi j'lai fais? je l'ignore 
 Faut qu'ca serve comme tre clbre 
 Putain, tu crois pas que see'tait mieux tre bon lve? 
 Avec une crve deux ans dans les dortoirs 
 Premier coeur j'crvre 
 Histoire comme les autres, brve 
 Debout dans les piqus de grve 
 Cette poque ma mre vit ses rves 
 Le syndicat est puissant et la une des prves 
 Et aprs quoi? Ils se sont tous taills comme des lches 
 Se sont couvert de la misre dans les flashs 
 Maman are'viens sur Terre 
 Ici merde see'est chacun sa ganache 
 Excuses moi pour ma scolarit l'arrache 
 Accroches mon coeur dans l'cadre 
 Et mon are'gard svre s'vade 
 Comme Jules se tire dans le back dans monade et srade 
 La vie see'est grave me laisse indiffrent, maintenant cest grave 
 Dans un arbre prosse l'ail nos initiales s'gravent 
 Mes amours, see'est ma main que j'tends 
 Attrapez la sans dire non, on perd dj trop d'temps 
 On joue tous les mmes scnes, les mmes peines 
 Restez fort quand les difficults d'te voir caller 
 Crie ou implore 
 See'est comme un implant qui tient l'bon chemin de haut 
 Alors que rien se tient, seul l'instein pousse nos limites 
 Excuse, why'en a pas mal qui imite 
 Chacun son sort, chacun ses rites 
 Chacun sa cause, fuck les antismites 
 Je dois rien personne part au Seigneur 
 Et see'qu'il emporte, faut l'grer 
 Chaque cellule grise part pas 
 Mais pour tre jug dans c'monde 
 Pourtant j'rve de libert dans c'monde 
 Ceux qui dirigent, see'est la minorit 
 Les femmes qui aiment faire ce spcial 
 Pour les deux pour, crient trop 
 L-bas why'aura pas d'blancs ni d'negros 
 You know? 
 [Unverified] 
 On se trouvera seul face lui 
 The lie shatter 
 No computer data 
 Only truth matter 
 Tout seul face lui 
 Every step you take 
 Every breath you take 
 Every move you make 
 Seul face lui 
 You can't escape fate 
 Allah be the maker 
 Bow down to your creator 
 Tout seul face l'unique 
 Tout seul you IAM 
 IAM 
 Who put the sun in the sky? 
 Who causes the birds to fly? 
 Who put the light in the eyes? 
 Who's the answer to why? 
 Every step you take, every breath you take 
 Every move you make, the most High create 
 No computer data, the lie shatter, only truth matter 
 I use the verbal gun of Allah to shoot at ya 
 I self lord and master of I-slam 
 Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah and IAM, IAM, IAM, IAM, IAM[Hook: woman] 
 We pop, we brawl, gettin' money til the day we fall 
 We pop, we brawl, gettin' money til the day we fall 
 [RZA] 
 Double barrel shotgun, pop son 
 I told nigga, just not run 
 I saw him on 205th in Fordham 
 This dog was frozen, so my high heat thawed him 
 I blown ya, you need a blood donor 
 My bitch ghetto, like Florida and Laronia 
 Laundry mat hoes, who bought clothes? 
 I flow checks, one followed by six o's (six o's) 
 I got hoes, in codes, in different areas 
 Four ton whips that's sittin' on interiors 
 The bass shake in the club like it's earthquakin' 
 I cock arm, pass the bomb, like Troy Aikman 
 Play the face, but like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson 
 You miserable, you get kidnapped by Kathy Bason 
 Thrown to the dungeon, for your spongin' 
 Of Wu Killa Bee, what's your total malfunction? 
 [Shacronz] 
 Come on, let's cut the crap, money 
 I've been gettin' this rap money 
 Crack money, stack money, I'm tryin' to get that Shaq money 
 That Mike Tyson, Michael Jordan, Michael Jack' money 
 Five hundred mill' and better, dog, yeah, now that's money 
 Act funny, ya'll make me laugh (haha) 
 Frontin' like you tough, you softer than a baby's ass 
 These lazy ass, lazy -- fuck you! Pay me cash 
 My crazy path will motor me into a Mercedes class 
  
 [Chorus: Shacronz] 
 We pop, we brawl, get money til the day we fall 
 My Glock, my fall, those shots through your bedroom door 
 From the P's, to the morgue, cop Louie all the way to my drawers 
 We pop, we brawl, get money til the way we fall 
 [Freemurda] 
 All ya'll can see is the back of my jersey 
 Blowin' in the wind, goin' back to Jersey 
 Off to Brooklyn, left you back in Jersey 
 I was doin' a buck 90 like a throwback jersey 
 Shame on a nigga, take it back to Dirty 
 Run, game on a nigga, I'll be back in thirty 
 Seconds, got the world's greatest reckon 
 And that money I'mma spend it like your greatest record 
 This Division, all the ladies respect it 
 Disrespect it and the eighty'll check it 
 It ain't hard to see how ya'll ignorin' the steel 
 Niggas that I clap, lookin' for me still 
 Til they look like they came out of George Foreman grill 
 Thoughts are stolen on Free, must be on them crills 
 Plus my, team gon' be holdin' like forty mill' 
 Thoughts are rollin' on E., must be on those pills 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Hook 2X][Instrumental][Verse 1] 
 Right or wrong, weak or strong, I ask who all can come 
 Take place and face number one 
 If you thinking that I'm lip syncing 
 You're mistaken, become awaken 
 As I make and break, but take my time 
 To rhyme, and infiltrate your mind 
 When it's allowed, I push through the crowd 
 Bag a girl, then walk out proud 
 Some surround me, others crown me 
 And girls with water, they try to drown me 
 But they not, plus, I'm a good swimmer 
 And a born winner 
 The most known, who don't postpone 
 And strip M.C.'s of crown and throne 
 Have 'em blown away by a cyclone 
 On the microphone 
 Yea, the mic, it makes me that type 
 I max, relax, plus get hype 
 Won't twitch, or switch, but yet I will 
 Walk the block, like a cop whose out to kill 
 Enemies, in my own territory 
 So watch out for me 
 But could you ever get far from Rakeem Allah? 
 Heck, nah, baby pa 
 Uh-uh... no way Jose 
 Don't play, because I'm out to slay 
 Any M.C. who gets in my way 
 But today, M.C.'s is D-Day 
 That means doomed, so build a tomb 
 And wait for the boom 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I'm taking heads off 
 I'm taking heads off 
 I'm taking heads off 
 So protect ya neck, kid... 
 I'm taking heads off... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now have you ever, ever, ever, ever, heard a style this clever 
 No, you never, never, never, never, never, never 
 I got my act together 
 I'm the iller, dealer, blood spiller, the graveyard filler 
 Who bless the microphone like no other 
 Better known as a live brother 
 I chop those, who try to smoke me 
 Took they heads off and used them as trophies 
 It might seem that I'm down right mean, or a killing machine 
 But lyrical broad, and thoughts I be installing 
 Have you thinking the sky is falling 
 Beat smart and start departing 
 Know now snakes can enter my garden 
 I-I-I-I-I don't play that jack, so-so, step back mack 
 'Cause I react like a rhyming bomber 
 Flow like a knight, in shining armor 
 Ducks, who wanna beat Rakeem 
 Pinch yourself and wake from the dream 
 I'm too strong, I can't be penetrated 
 You'll be eliminated, on the battlefield, I pity no man 
 Chop so many heads, you might think I'm Conan 
 But I consider myself to be iller 
 I'm more like Jack, the giant killer 
 So quit it, instead of thinking 
 That you can win, 'cause you dead and stinking 
 You're too soft, so break north 
 You just loss... I'm taking heads off 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'm taking heads off... yo, I'm taking heads off... 
 Rakeem Allah... is taking heads off... 
 Know what I'm saying? So yo.. just protect ya neck 
 Know what I'm saying? I'm in full effect coming with a sharp sword 
 That's my vocals chords, 'cause Rakeem is the lord 
 So applaud, if you can afford, and keep ya tapes on record 
 Yeah... and if I may say... I wanna give a shout out to all the Gods 
 Funky president Melquan and Shabazz, Unique Ason 
 Know what I'm saying? The Genius of Rap, Shallah Raekwon 
 My man Shaquan, my brother Divine, King Shabazz 
 King Sun and Shaboo, Queen Nefertiti in the place to be 
 My man Jerry G. and grime is in full effect 
 Can't forget the Posse of the REC, known as the D.M.D 
 With the God U-G, and my name muthafuckin' 
 Super Doopa Party Looper, Hoopa Hoopa, O.G 
 Know what I'm saying? And whoever else I forgot, forget 'em 
 Et cetera, et cetera, no one could be better 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 We got the names in the game and the fame 
 Where like Each B., and Doug Love and Butter and all those others 
 Brothers, and so forth, and wiz and the wisdoms is on my shit..InstrumentalINSTRUMENTAL[RZA] 
 Ayo, from the Temples of Tibet, to the pyramids of Kimet 
 The genelect intellect, it connects every root of civilization 
 We symbolize nations and pitimize the creation 
 Designed to wire station, peep the wise architecht 
 What's up son, I told ya'll, Protect Ya Neck 
 That was back in Born Three, born understanding, and my shit is expanding 
 Aiyo worldwide exclusive 
 We got the Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah, puzzled like a jigsaw 
 My man J-Love, comin' down from the heavens above 
 About to splash ya muthafuckas with a phat ass mixtape 
 You can't escape, it's like a date rape 
 I might bust that grape, with the apple head, if your legs get spread 
 If your ears open to the size of a cymbal 
 Yo, check it out, I got buckwild rhymin' style 
 Most niggas that cannot resamble 
 But you use to be, a bad muthafucka, but can't fuck with me 
 And you, you used to be, a dope M.C 
 And you, used to be, a pretty ass bitch 
 And you, used to be a live ass player 
 And you, used to be, on some ol' buckwild shit 
 But you fell victim to the devil, to the C-Cypher Punks and all that shit 
 And you just walking around with your muthafuckin' head in cloud nine and shit 
 It's the Birth of a Prince! Aim for the nigga born like me, ever since 
 Two thousand B.C., be happy when ya'll see me 
 I'm the G to the O, to the O, to the digga-digga-digga D 
 Phat ass...[Instrumental][Verse 1: RZA] 
 There once was a boy by the name of Michael 
 He was the type of brother who did like to 
 Rob and steel [?] 
 Even kill just to get a meal 
 But he didn't eat reddened me 
 Instead he filled his head with getting hot treats 
 15 years old, strong young blood 
 Who didn't say no when it came to drugs 
 The panic never taught him, it only bored him 
 Then one day, his father caught him 
 Thus, he was thrown out of his home 
 A young black youth, out on his own 
 From many shelters, he was kicked 
 Now he lives like a derelict 
 In the gutter, I say the brother is stuck 
 Acting depressed now which was is up 
  
 [Hook] 
 Which way is up? Anybody tell me? 
 Which was is up? 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Now Mary, Mary on the contrary 
 She was a girl who was extraordinary 
 Everyday she went to the library 
 Hanging out was secondary 
 Stacked in the back, her look was dope 
 Reputation clean like a bar of soap 
 17, a virgin queen 
 Church going girl if you know what I mean? 
 But her best friend Lynne was full of sin 
 Been having sex since the age of 10 
 Influenced Mary within a year 
 [?] expensive gear to wear 
 And earrings to put into her ear 
 Married soon, forgot all about [?] 
 Increased her speed chug and weave 
 But instead she loves to smoke weed 
 Her reputation is now filthy 
 Neighborhood hooker, feeling rather guilty 
 Weed smoking a blunt scratching a blunt 
 Asking the question, which way is up? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Which way is up? 
 Yo yo yo Which was is up? 
 Ay ay, which way is up?[Chorus x4: La the Darkaman & Wu-Tang Clan] 
 Wu World Order 
  
 [Verse 1: La the Darkman] 
 Yo; Niggas is feeble, I'm calm but violent like Ben Siegel 
 I’m anti-evil, plus I touch a desert eagle 
 My life's illegal, slave man princess' is equal 
 The devil’s lethal, he killed a hundred million people 
 I'm Darkman, Iceman, La, Wu-Tang Clan 
 Trapacanty, sensei, ¿comprendé? 
 My marine corps, straight from the Trojan war 
 Black-capped crusader, trapped off, flame thrower 
 Stuck a chain store when I was dirt poor for my reward 
 Next week the Germans have me on a bulletin board 
 I beat that case, they couldn't identify my face 
 I'm triple darkness, silence or I'll have you erased 
 Me and my Wu pirates start riots with Osiris 
 Math, I apply it, kill you, but I'm quiet 
 Respect the Abbott, it's Love Allah 
 Shine like a superstar, sting with the cobra claw, what? 
  
 [Chorus x8: La the Darkaman & Wu-Tang Clan] 
 Wu World Order 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 Yo; I enter through the chamber of your ear 
 In a high-pitched silent tone only a dog could hear 
 And impregnate you, with the wisdom of the Wu 
 Then your subconscious dreams come constantly true 
 Have you in such deep thought 
 Your pulse and blood pressure's so low 
 You diagnosed as corpse 
 Having outer body experience, Clan no interference 
 Everything with physical form, lose appearance 
 We become one with the formulas, now you feel the strongest 
 Escape, trample lies, you live for the longest 
 Live a thousand years in a day 
 Without opening your mouth you say 
 Everything you wanted to say 
 Attract to the call of the earth, I stay grounded 
 The sun in the center of this, I’m surrounded 
 My planets in midst, I spins, the windchill 
 But my light melts your snowflake from ninety-three mil’ 
 All who have the ear, let 'em here as we reveal 
 ’Cause one ear of corn can produce a cornfield 
 And one cornfield can produce the corn mill 
 The bread from the body of Christ, on this field 
 With the truth of life inside your bone marrow 
 You could make your physical as large as your shadow 
 Whether space or cyborg, optic is fiber 
 Become a pawn, multimedia subscriber 
 And hibernate, the Wu tape in your mental state 
 Let it meditate, sit back and await 
 The orders, for this you don't need no tape recorder 
 So let's prepare for the Wu World Order 
  
 [Chorus x8: La the Darkaman & Wu-Tang Clan] 
 Wu World Order 
  
 [Outro: RZA] 
 We coming soon and we striking at your borders

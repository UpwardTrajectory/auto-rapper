 [Intro] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man) 
 It's time, man (Aight, man, begin) 
 Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap 
 Where fake niggas don't make it back 
 I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now; 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin' 
 Musician, inflictin', composition 
 Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine 
 Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme 
 Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes 
 I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes 
 Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay 
 I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway 
 Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs 
 Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps 
 G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit 
 Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped 
 Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin' 
 Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston 
 Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and 
 I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin 
 Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit 
 Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip 
 Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look 
 Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!" 
 Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger 
 Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber 
 So, now I'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby 
 And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be 
 (So, what you sayin'?) 
 It's like the game ain't the same 
 Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name 
 And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners 
 In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us 
 .45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact 
 Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks in black 
 There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked 
 So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop 
 I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock 
 And if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo 
 You gotta slide on a vacation 
 Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin' 
 It drops deep as it does in my breath 
 I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined 
 I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's 
 Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped 
 Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks 
 Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops 
 But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger 
 Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
 Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin' 
 Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter 
 Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta 
 In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays 
 Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze 
 Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed 
 From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back 
 Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black 
 The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back 
 And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn 
 Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes 
 I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane 
 Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain 
 And be prosperous, though we live dangerous 
 Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages 
 It's only right that I was born to use mics 
 And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes 
 I've taken rappers to a new plateau 
 Through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule 
 The smooth criminal on beat breaks 
 Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes 
 The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps 
 That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks 
 I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers 
 In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya 
 Inhale deep like the words of my breath 
 I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times 
 Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
 New York state of mind 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 "Nasty Nas—"[Produced by Ron Browz] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
 (What's up, niggas? 
 Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog 
 You? What?!) 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
 (You been on my dick, nigga 
 You love my style, nigga) 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I) Fuck with your soul like ether 
 (Will) Teach you – the king – you know you 
 (Not) God's Son across the belly 
 (Lose) I prove you lost already 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin' 
 It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive 
 Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best 
 East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy 
 I embrace y'all with napalm 
 Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone 
 How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage 
 Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne! 
 I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest 
 Name a rapper that I ain't influenced 
 Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas 
 With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I) Fuck with your soul like ether 
 (Will) Teach you – the king – you know you 
 (Not) God's Son across the belly 
 (Lose) I prove you lost already 
  
 [Interlude 1] 
 Ayo, pass me the weed! 
 Put my ashes out on these niggas, man 
 Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel 
 And kiss the motherfuckin' ring! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I) Fuck with your soul like ether 
 (Will) Teach you – the king – you know you 
 (Not) God's Son across the belly 
 (Lose) I prove you lost already 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten 
 Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave 
 Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face 
 Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes 
 With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take? 
 When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep 
 That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef 
 Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo 
 To explode it on a camel and his soldiers 
 I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid 
 When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!) 
 First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say 
 That you better than B.I.G 
 Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live? 
  
 [Interlude 2] 
 I… will… not… lose 
 God's son across the belly 
 I prove you lost already 
 The king is back, where my crown at? 
 Ill Will, rest in peace! 
 Let's do it, niggas! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I) Fuck with your soul like ether 
 (Will) Teach you – the king – you know you 
 (Not) God's Son across the belly 
 (Lose) I prove you lost already 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches 
 What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother 
 You traded your soul for riches 
 My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous 
 And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it 
 You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women 
 Were you abused as a child? 
 Scared to smile? They called you ugly? 
 Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me 
 Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly 
 In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building 
 Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers 
 All I did was give you a style for you to run with 
 Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God 
 Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars 
 No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case 
 Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase 
 You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan 
 I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class? 
 You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic? 
 Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge? 
 Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though 
 That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow 
 Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy? 
 Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy 
 Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter 
 And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after? 
 Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas 
 And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas 
 Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas 
 In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas 
 Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss 
 What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks? 
 Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin' 
 With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack 
 And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame 
 You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane 
 To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit 
 You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention 
 Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha! 
 R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick 
 J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick 
 Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick 
 Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick! 
 So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick 
 How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips? 
 Wanted to be on every last one of my classics 
 You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss![Produced by L.E.S. & Nas] 
  
 [Intro: AZ and Nas] 
 Ayo, what's up, what's up? 
 Let's keep it real, son, count this money 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah 
 Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 ‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons 
 The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go 
 I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right? 
 Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yo, then what, man, what?! 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality 
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary 
 And my mentality is money-orientated 
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
 ‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters 
 But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners 
 Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin 
 Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition 
 Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us 
 'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
 Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go 
 But as long as we leavin' thievin' 
 We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough 
 So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors 
 Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers 
 Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high 
 ‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin' 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and 
 My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it 
 One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from 
 My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain 
 When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards 
 Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash 
 And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash 
 Now it's all about cash in abundance 
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!" 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric 
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die

 [Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas] 
 (It's yours) 
 Whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then 
 Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
 Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement 
 Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe 
 The mind activation, react like I'm facin' 
 Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin' 
 Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets 
 Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete 
 Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep 
 I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep 
 I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?) 
 I'm out for dead presidents to represent me 
  
 [Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas] 
 Whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 To my man Ill Will 
 God bless your life 
 To my peoples throughout Queens 
 God bless your life 
 I trip, we box up crazy bitches 
 Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures 
 Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's 
 Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul 
 The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child 
 Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled 
 Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle 
 There's no days for broke days 
 We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray 
 To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water 
 Odds against Nas are slaughter 
 Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter 
 My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection 
 Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did 
 He'll lead a right direction 
 How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre 
 You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker? 
  
 [Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas] 
 (It's yours) 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Break it down 
 It's yours, it's yours 
 It's yours, it's yours 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed 
 For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded 
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne 
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home 
 I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow 
 ‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow 
 Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip 
 Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip 
 And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up 
 Even my brain's in handcuffs 
 Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom 
 The crew is lampin', Big Willie style 
 Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild 
 Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge 
 Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames 
 Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today 
  
 [Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas] 
 (It's yours) 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
 Yeah, the world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
 (It's yours) 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Yeah, a'ight? 
 To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours!) 
 The world is yours 
 To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!) 
 The world is yours 
 To everybody in Brooklyn 
 Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours!) 
 The world is yours 
 Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours!) 
 Long Island, the world is yours (It's yours!) 
 Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours!) 
 South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours!)

 [Verse 1] 
 Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto 
 Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though 
 You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out 
 Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out 
 96 ways I made out, Montana way 
 The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray 
 Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray 
 A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay 
 Red dot plots, murder schemes 
 32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns 
 17 rocks gleam from one ring 
 They let me let y'all niggas know one thing 
 There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King 
 The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen 
 Antera spinnin' on millenniums 
 20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em 
 Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline 
 Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec 
 To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC 
 Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it 
 Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em 
 Crack the legs way out of formation 
 It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon 
 Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon? 
 Grab your gun, it's on though 
 Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight 
 With the broke MAC that won't spray right 
 Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit 
 Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit 
 Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
 I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
 I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
 I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I peeped you frontin' 
 I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin' 
 Across the street you was wildin' 
 Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89 
 Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine 
 I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine 
 Clanked him—what was he thinkin'? 
 On my corner when it's pay-me time 
 Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin 
 Somethin' told me "Plug him!" 
 So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb 
 Spun around and shot one 
 Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one 
 Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come 
 Then they came askin' me my name 
 What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through 
 Left the hospital that same night, what 
 Got my gat back, time to backtrack 
 I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped? 
 Black was in the Jeep watchin' 
 All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun 
 And yo, nobody in my hood got one 
 That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily 
 The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me? 
 So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours 
 Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls 
 Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before 
 We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw 
 But a thug changes and love changes 
 And best friends become strangers, word up 
  
 [Hook] 
 Y'a–Y'all know my steelo 
 Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back 
 Y'a–Y'all know my steelo 
 Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back

 Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas 
 Gettin' it on in the world, you know? 
 To them niggas that's locked down 
 Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'? 
 To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide 
 Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia 
 Nine-six shit, The Firm clique 
 Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though 
 It's been a long time comin' 
 Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy 
 Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo

 [Verse 1] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail 
 The mic is contacted, I attract clientele 
 My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin' 
 Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin' 
 ‘Cause in my physical I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop 
 Place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille 
 It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a TEC with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose 
 Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This rhythmatic explosion 
 Is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again 
 Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot 
 Vocals will squeeze Glocks 
 MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep, I never fell 
 Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell[Produced by Q-Tip] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid 
 When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
 Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done 
 Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son 
 I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough 
 He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff 
 I was like, "Yeah," shorty don't care, she a snake too 
 Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach 
 It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime 
 Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's 
 And night time is more trife than ever 
 What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together? 
 If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest 
 Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my nigga when push came to shove 
 (One what?) One love! 
  
 [Hook: Q-Tip] 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in New York the same shit is goin' on 
 The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin' 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin' 
 That nigga you shot last year tried to appear 
 Like he hurtin' somethin' 
 Word to mother, I heard him frontin' 
 And he be pumpin' on your block 
 Your man gave him your Glock 
 And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever 
 Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease 
 But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece 
 Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira 
 Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
 But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours 
 On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal 
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next V-I 
 I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks 
 Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey 
 So stay civilized, time flies 
 Though incarcerated your mind dies 
 I hate it when your moms cries 
 It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala 
 I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love 
  
 [Hook: Q-Tip] 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world, thinkin' 
 "How can we exist through the facts?" 
 Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects 
 I take my pen and pad for the weekend 
 Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin' 
 A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home 
 You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible 
 Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue 
 Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop 
 Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops 
 He said: "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof 
 So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce." 
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black 
 We was chillin' on these benches 
 Where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard 
 Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit 
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him 
 ‘Cause when the pistol blows 
 The one that's murdered be the cool one 
 Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up 
 Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up 
 At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed 
 Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes 
 Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze 
 Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love 
  
 [Hook: Q-Tip] 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 To all my niggas locked up 
 From Queensbridge and all over 
 To my man [Goon?], one love 
 To my man Herb, one love 
 To my man [Lake Gucciano?], one love 
 Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big [Bo?], one love 
 To [Oogie?], yeah, one love[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters] 
  
 [Intro: Nas] 
 Life, I wonder 
 Will it take me under? 
 I don't know 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin' 
 Imagine going to court with no trial 
 Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters 
 More conscious of the way we raise our daughters 
 Days are shorter, nights are colder 
 Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra 
 The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently 
 It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually 
 Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge 
 If coke was cooked without the garbage 
 We'd all have the top dollars 
 Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes 
 Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles 
 Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers 
 Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers 
 Just some thoughts for the mind 
 I take a glimpse into time 
 Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine" 
  
 [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] 
 If I ruled the world (imagine that) 
 I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby 
 Black diamonds and pearls 
 (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) 
 If I ruled the world 
 (Still living for today, in these last days and times) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The way to be, paradise like relaxin' 
 Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon 
 Armani Exchange deranged 
 Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last 
 Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path 
 The Villa house is for the crew, how we do 
 Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches 
 So many years of depression make me vision 
 The better livin', type of place to raise kids in 
 Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul 
 But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child 
 Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin' 
 Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin' 
 Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage 
 Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish 
 Political prisoner set free, stress free 
 No work release, purple M3's and jet skis 
 Feel the wind breeze in West Indies 
 I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities 
 And reverse fiends to Willies 
 It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown 
 I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa 
  
 [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] 
 If I ruled the world (imagine that) 
 I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby 
 Black diamonds and pearls 
 (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) 
 If I ruled the world 
 (Still living for today, in these last days and times) 
  
 [Bridge: Lauryn Hill] 
 And then we'll walk right up to the sun 
 Hand in hand 
 We'll walk right up to the sun 
 We won't land 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry 
 Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory 
 Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes 
 These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state 
 Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight 
 Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe 
 Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer 
 Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler 
 ‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich 
 Still nobody want a nigga having shit 
 If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit 
 I push a Q-45 Infinit(i) 
 It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies 
 Strictly living longevity to the destiny 
 I thought I'd never see, but reality struck 
 Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck? 
  
 [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] 
 If I ruled the world (imagine that) 
 I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby 
 Black diamonds and pearls 
 (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) 
 If I ruled the world 
 (Still living for today, in these last days and times) 
 If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (imagine that) 
 I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled 
 I love 'em love 'em baby 
 Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds 
 (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine) 
 If I ruled the world 
 (Still living for today, in these last days and times) 
  
 [Outro: Lauryn Hill] 
 If I ruled the world, if I ruled 
 If I ruled, I'd free all my sons 
 Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby 
 Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled 
 If I ruled the world 
 If I ruled the world 
 I love 'em love 'em baby!![Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Straight up, shit is real 
 And any day could be your last in the jungle 
 Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble 
 The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals 
 Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare 
 At the out-of-towners 
 (Ay, yo, yo, who that?), they better break North 
 Before we get the four pounders and take their face off 
 The streets is filled with undercovers 
 Homicide chasing brothers 
 The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us 
 And killer coppers even come through in helicopters 
 I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock 
 For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners 
 Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em 
 And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods 
 I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards 
 Nas is a rebel of the street corner 
 Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella 
 Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller 
 Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed 
 When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess 
 Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back 
 Love committing sins and my friends sell crack 
 This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue 
 The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one 
 ‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts 
 So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts 
 The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator 
 The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator 
 Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game 
 Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames 
 Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs 
 Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about 
 Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan 
 Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne 
 I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block 
 Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops 
 If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots 
 We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks 
 Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man 
 Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand 
 Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man 
 But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam 
 Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop 
 Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow 
 Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit 
 My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it 
 It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs 
 'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Represent y'all, represent 
 Represent y'all, represent 
 Represent y'all, represent 
 Represent y'all, represent 
  
 [Outro] 
 One time for your mothafuckin' mind 
 This goes out to everybody in New York 
 That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over 
 To my man Big Will, he's still here 
 The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S 
 Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters 
 My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse 
 The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid 
 Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies 
 My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie 
 Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD 
 And my man Premo from Gang Starr 
 '94 real shit y'all (word up Harry O) 
 Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though! 
  
 [Nas' posse] 
 Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas! 
 Young bitch ass motherfuckers! 
 Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker! 
 Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back 
 That's just a warm up 
 ‘Cause I can– on anybody, anybody[Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Umm, Premo, Nas 
 Yeah, yeah, yo 
 ("Nas is...", "Nas is..." 
 "Nas is...", "Nas is..." 
 "Nas is...", "Nas is...", "Nas is...") 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born 
 Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end 
 As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain 
 My plateau, and also, what defines my name 
 First it was Nasty, but times have changed 
 Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign is for pain 
 I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame 
 Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine 
 Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane? 
 That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim 
 On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees 
 Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze 
 Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads 
 To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough 
 To the big dogs living large, taking in light 
 Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life 
 It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it 
 Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked 
 Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt 
 And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. " 
 "My poetry's deep, I never fell.." 
 "Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.." 
 "No doubt.." 
 "Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. " 
 "My poetry's deep, I never fell.." 
 "Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.." 
 "No doubt.." 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 "Nas is like…" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires 
 Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver 
 Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars 
 Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas 
 "Nas is like…" Iron Mike, messiah type 
 Before the Christ, after the death 
 The last one left, let my cash invest in stock 
 Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks 
 Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres 
 From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough 
 Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros 
 Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth? 
 Can't take it with you under this earth 
 Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked 
 They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid 
 Before my number's called, history's made 
 Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die 
 Making choices that determine my future under the sky 
 To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why 
 It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame? 
 Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite 
 Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. " 
 "My poetry's deep, I never fell.." 
 "Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.." 
 "No doubt.." 
 "Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. " 
 "My poetry's deep, I never fell.." 
 "Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.." 
 "No doubt.." 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 "Nas is like…" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet 
 I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows 
 I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather 
 Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers 
 I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for 
 Always got you, I’m like pop dukes you would cry for 
 I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money 
 Corporate accounts from a rich company 
 I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races 
 Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam 
 Bulletproof Hummer man 
 I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam 
 I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand 
 I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet 
 Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up 
 Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night, now… 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "

 [Hook] 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age 
 Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage 
 Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase? 
 Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised 
 Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless 
 Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit 
 She heard stories of her daddy thuggin' 
 So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him 
 Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that 
 Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at 
 Niggas got game, they be tryna live 
 He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is 
 Although you real, plus a honest kid 
 Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit 
 You seventeen, I got a problem with it 
 She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure 
 But she rockin' with it 
  
 [Hook] 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 Not sayin' that our sons are less important 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 Not sayin' that our sons are less important 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig 
 This social network said: "Nas, go and get your kid!" 
 She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic 
 Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right? 
 Her mother cried when she answered 
 Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted 
 A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it 
 At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent 
 I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her 
 Should've drove more time to school with her 
 I thought I dropped enough jewels on her 
 Took her from private school, so she can get a balance 
 To public school, they're too nurture teen talents 
 They grow fast, one day she's your little princess 
 Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this? 
 They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world 
 God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls 
  
 [Hook] 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 Not sayin' that our sons are less important 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 For my brothers with daughters, I call this 
 Not sayin' that our sons are less important 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up 
 But I just wanna see you dream up 
 I finally understand 
 It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man 
 Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons 
 How fathers feel for they daughters 
 When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa 
 When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off 
 ‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters 
 Love[Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word 
 Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'? 
 We gonna do a lil somethin' like this 
 Y'know what I'm sayin'? 
 (Y'all doing that other shit) 
 Keep it on and on and on and on and 
 Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, what is it? 
 (It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners 
 Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a 
 Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai 
 I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie 
 Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er 
 My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer 
 Sentence begins indented with formality 
 My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology 
 Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop 
 I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block 
 I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat 
 Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke 
 It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines 
 The high pipes, murderous night times 
 And knife fights invite crimes 
 Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap 
 With my peeps that's into drug money market interact 
 No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler 
 I guess that means peace 
 For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya 
 Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo 
 With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below 
 (Peace God!) Peace God – now the shit is explained 
 I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane 
 It's like that, y'all… 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars 
 Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars 
 I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz? 
 My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses 
 Live amongst no roses, only the drama 
 For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja 
 Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces 
 You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces 
 Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow 
 And back down po-po when I'm vexed so 
 My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank 
 I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank 
 Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail 
 Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales 
 My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails 
 I'll reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real 
 Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats 
 I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "peace" 
 I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats 
 They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black 
 Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing 
 Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin 
 Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still 
 Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill 
 True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein 
 I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 "Now let me take a trip down memory lane" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
  
 [Outro: DJ Premier scratching] 
 "Comin' out of Queensbridge" 
 "Comin' out of Queensbridge" 
 "Comin' out of Queensbridge" 
 "Comin' out of Queensbridge" 
 "The most dangerous MC is…" 
 "Comin' out of Queensbridge" 
 "The most dangerous MC is…"

 [Intro] 
 One time, yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage 
 One nigga front, my face on the front page 
 Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib 
 One God to show me how to do things his son did 
 Pure, like a cup of virgin blood 
 Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip 
 Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit 
 Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics 
 Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages 
 Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us 
 Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us 
 One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up? 
 But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again 
 Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken 
 Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in 
 Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit! 
 This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it 
 'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown 
 Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb 
 We need more warriors soon 
 Sent from the stars, sun and the moon 
 In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers 
 Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors 
 If you really think you ready to die with 9s out 
 This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, all I need is one mic 
 All I need is one mic (that's all I need) 
 All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas) 
 All I need is one mic (yeah) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen 
 One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin 
 Matter of fact, maybe more than one 
 Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them! 
 Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots 
 From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32 
 Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17 
 27 hit your crew, six went into you 
 Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral 
 Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent 
 Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs 
 My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air 
 I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times 
 Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s 
 If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis 
 Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty 
 There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush 
 Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut 
 That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down 
 'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need) 
 All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world) 
 All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know) 
 All I need is one mic (this is all I need) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man 
 What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand 
 Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical 
 Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do 
 Wonder what my secrets is 
 Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is 
 I have none, too late to grab guns 
 I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga 
 Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas 
 What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin' 
 War gets deep, some beef is everlastin' 
 Complete with thick scars 
 Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards 
 Drama, where does it start? 
 You know the block was ill as a youngster 
 Every night it was like a cop'll get killed 
 Body found in the dumpster 
 For real a hustler, purchased my Range 
 Niggas throwin' dirt on my name 
 Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain 
 Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished 
 Shoulda knew she wasn't true 
 She came to me when her man caught a sentence 
 Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes 
 Movin' with a change of pace 
 Lighter load, see now the king is straight 
 Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real 
 Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal? 
 This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found 
 You need some soul-searchin', the time is now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah) 
 All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash) 
 All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry) 
 All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)[Produced by Salaam Remi] 
  
 [Hook: Amy Winehouse] 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me? 
 I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me? 
 Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see 
 And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home 
 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry 
 Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home 
 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike 
 Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night 
 She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life 
 Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life 
 'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before 
 She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour 
 She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good 
 She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good 
 For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real 
 Who not after material wealth but get dough still 
 Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette 
 Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president 
 As long as there’s no selfishness 
 Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident 
 You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent 
 Your smile put me at ease 
 You’re the woman I need, but where is she? 
  
 [Hook: Amy Winehouse] 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me? 
 I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me? 
 Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see 
 And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home 
 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry 
 Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home 
 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I hate when people write me hostile texts 
 On account of my lifestyle’s perception 
 Invade my personal life? Out of the question 
 What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and 
 They never suppose I get my quiet time in? 
 They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash 
 God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass? 
 I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad 
 I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad 
 I drag off the L and try to silence it 
 The noise in my head, the curse of the talented 
 Strong communicator, vagabond 
 I’d gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar 
 It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch 
 Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this? 
 An immaculate version of "Me & My Bitch" by Biggie 
 With all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me 
  
 [Hook: Amy Winehouse] 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me? 
 I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see 
 Where is he, the man who was just like me?

 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry 
 Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home 
 I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

 Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine 
 Everything’s good, everything’s fine 
 Yeah, yeah, we bring it every time 
 Yeah, pour a little cherry wine 
 Yeah, hey yo, Salaam 
 Yeah, I think they know the time 
 Everything’s good, everything’s fine 
 Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah

 [Intro] 
 (Right… Right…) 
 Check me out y'all 
 Nasty Nas in your area 
 About to cause mass hysteria 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Before a blunt, I take out my fronts 
 Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt 
 You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer 
 That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever 
 King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major 
 Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager 
 ‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass 
 40-side is the place that is givin' me grace 
 Now wait, another dose and you might be dead 
 And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds 
 And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange 
 So the mic warmer was born to gain 
 Nas, why did you do it? 
 You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme 
 It's halftime 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Right…) It's halftime 
 (Right…) Ayo it's halftime 
 (Right…) It's halftime 
 (Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime 
 This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's like that, you know it's like that 
 I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back 
 When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back 
 So I react never calmly on a hype track 
 I set it off with my own rhyme 
 ‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time 
 I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex 
 In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck 
 I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive 
 When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5 
 I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it 
 With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach 
 Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise 
 This is exercise 'til the microphone dies 
 Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin' 
 But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and 
 Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand 
 And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man 
 I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships 
 I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips 
 I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic 
 Versatile, my style switches like a faggot 
 But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual 
 Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo 
 These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand? 
 ‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man 
 Am I in place with the bass and format? 
 Explore rap and tell me, "Nas ain't all that" 
 And next time I rhyme, I be foul 
 Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild 
 I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme 
 Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Right…) It's halftime 
 (Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime 
 (Right…) It's halftime 
 (Right…) It's real in the field 
 Word life, check it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song 
 Every afternoon, I kick half the tune 
 And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit 
 Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it 
 ‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word 
 I be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third 
 But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay 
 I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee 
 Puttin' hits on 5-0 
 ‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44 
 And biters can't come near 
 And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia 
 I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed 
 That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed 
 This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten 
 Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and 
 The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout 
 Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out 
  
 [Outro] 
 (Right…) It's still halftime 
 (Right…) To the Queensbridge crew 
 To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime 
 (Right…) '92, it's halftime 
 (Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost 
 Halftime…[Intro] 
 Freedom or jail, clips inserted 
 A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered 
 The beginning and end, as far as rap goes 
 It's only natural, I explain my plateau 
 And also what defines my name 
  
 [Hook: J. Cole (Sampled)] 
 Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals 
 Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible 
 Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin 
 No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin' 
 Along comes a one son called a offspring 
 The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn 
 She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins 
 I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out 
 Screams got in the game and took bread out 
 The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel 
 Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though 
 'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas 
 But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga 
 Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up 
 Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen 
 Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer 
 But I had a appeal, I was a charmer 
 Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor 
 This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby 
 We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's 
 But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps 
 And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad 
 But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad 
 At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats 
 And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great 
 Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face 
 They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes 
 And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame 
 So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same 
 The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures 
 A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it 
 Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin' 
 Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin' 
 That's some advice I never got 
 If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock 
 While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you 
 That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time 
 Now I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd 
 Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud 
  
 [Bridge: Nas] 
 So you ain't let Nas down 
 It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga 
 You ain't let Nas down 
 How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga 
 You ain't let Nas down 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals 
 Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible 
 Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin 
 Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end[Produced by Dave Atkinson & Trackmasters] 
  
 [Intro: AZ] 
 This is what, this what they want, huh? 
 This is what it's all about? 
 Time to take Affirmative Action, son 
 They just don't understand, you kna'mean? 
 Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man 
 Niggas don't understand the four devils 
 Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact 
 Sip your con-gi-ac 
 And let's all wash this money through this laundromat 
 Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar 
 In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler 
 Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint 
 Catch 'em and break 
 Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape 
 The Corleone, fettuccine Capone 
 Roam in your own zone 
 Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome 
 We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown 
 Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown 
 Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats 
 See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black 
  
 [Verse 2: Cormega] 
 Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche 
 My destiny's to be the new boss 
 That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft 
 That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin 
 They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth 
 I put the hit out 
 Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me 
 In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies 
 Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up 
 Bring your heater, all your cream go between us 
 Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip 
 I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks 
 My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team 
 Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends 
 Yukons and ninja black Lexus 
 'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections 
 It's The Firm, nigga, set it 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury 
 I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes 
 And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake 
 It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate 
 And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit 
 It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique 
 My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee 
 Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me 
 Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me 
 I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me 
 Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars 
 Your top papi Señor Escobar 
  
 [Verse 4: Foxy Brown] 
 In the black Camaro, Firm deep 
 All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow 
 Wallabee's be the apparel 
 Through the darkest tunnel 
 I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle 
 In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle 
 E Money bags got Moët Chandon 
 Bundle of sixty-two 
 They ain't got a clue what we about to do 
 My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar 
 Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar 
 I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin 
 Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera 
 Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz 
 Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is? 
 I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy 
 Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van 
 We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy 
 The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi 
 Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan 
 On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal 
 And Baba Shallah spoke 
 Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke 
 Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though 
 Flippin' the bigger picture 
 The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper 
 He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla 
 We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half 
 Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip? 
 32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16 
 Double it times three, we got 48 
 Which mean a whole lot of cream 
 Divide the profit by four 
 Subtract it by eight, we back to 16 
 Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through 
 So let's see, if we flip this other ki 
 Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak 
 Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty 
 Now triple that times three 
 We got three quarters of another ki

 [Intro: Super Cat] 
 He's the heartbeat of the people 
 The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people 
 The people who cannot afford to go to big concert 
 Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable 
 Some of them can afford a radio 
 So the only thing they can listen to is the music 
 People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people 
 Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality 
  
 [Sample from "Dance Inna New York" by Super Cat] 
 New York girl, dem a mad over we 
 New York girl, dem a mad over we 
 New York girl, dem a mad over we

 Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle 
 Hope I don't catch a homo 
 Grossing our net, simultaneously making me climb higher 
 Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me, fuck sadness 
 Had this been you having this lavish 
 Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards 
 You would have sex on condominium roof decks 
 So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs 
 Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi 
 My Colombiana mommy riding beside me 
 Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body 
 I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty 
 My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment 
 Just 'cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it 
 In '97 the six, '98 the Bentley 
 Now it’s the Ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but

 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black 
 With the square top pocket that snaps 
 Where the gas at? 
 Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your ass crack 
 I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at 
 Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack 
 I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that 
 Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at 
 Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat 
 Now I'm the one who repping Queens 
 Way beyond your wildest dreams 
 Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team 
 That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans 
 Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen 
 I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine 
 I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king 
 Although he’s on to another chapter 
 Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to, raaaahhh 
  
 [Chorus: Super Cat sample] 
 Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don 
 Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance 
 Inna New York City-city, New York City-city

 Yeah, yeah 
 New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island 
 The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens 
 It's all about surviving 
 Same old two-step, try to stay alive when they be out robbing 
 I been out rhyming since born knowledge 
 Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar 
 Worth more than the blood of a martyr, so I'ma 
 Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars 
 Keep your friends close and your enemies closer 
 Love model chocha, mommy pop it like she 'pose to 
 Eyes red shot like I'm never sober 
 Big time smoker, Indonesian doja 
 Mini me's you can hold up 
 Before you end up wet up from my soldier 
 Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit 
 This for every ghetto in the hood

 [Hook: Children's Choir] 
 I know I can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard at it 
 I'll be where I wanna be 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Be, b-boys and girls, listen up 
 You can be anything in the world, in God we trust 
 An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
 But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice 
 Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star 
 She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe 
 Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version 
 Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin 
 Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose 
 Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old 
 No fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath 
 'Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
 Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring 
 'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing 
 So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how 
 Put your hands in the air, and take the vow 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Be, b-boys and girls, listen again 
 This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10 
 The ones who watch videos and do what they see 
 As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID 
 Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV 
 You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
 Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be 
 Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
 Older than you are, give yourself time to grow 
 You thinking he can give you wealth, but so 
 Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know 
 You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice 
 You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write 
 Begging different women for a place to sleep at night 
 Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish 
 If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
 Now, go… 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Be, be-fore we came to this country 
 We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys 
 There was empires in Africa called Kush 
 Timbuktu, where every race came to get books 
 To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans 
 Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when 
 Gold was converted to money it all changed 
 Money then became empowerment for Europeans 
 The Persian military invaded 
 They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred 
 Africa was almost robbed naked 
 Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
 Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
 He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces 
 Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
 Still goes on today, you see? 
 If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
 They learn to survive until they gain control 
 Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes 
 Read more, learn more, change the globe 
 Ghetto children, do your thing 
 Hold your head up, little man, you're a king 
 Young Princess when you get your wedding ring 
 Your man is saying "She's my Queen" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

 [Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy] 
 Escobar Season has returned 
 It's been a long time, been a long time comin' 
 It's life or death for me now 
 But you know, there's no turnin' back now 
 This is what makes me, this is what I am 
 Feel me? Let's go 
  
 [Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas] 
 You can hate me now, (Q.B.) 
 But I won't stop now (Real niggas) 
 'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) 
 You can hate me now (C'mon) 
 But I won't stop now 
 'Cause I can't stop now 
 You can hate me now 
 You can hate me now 
  
 [Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)] 
 Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too 
 It's as simple as that 
 Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die! 
 You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck 
 Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now) 
 Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now) 
 Fuck y'all! 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy 
 Ice that I wear, flows that I try 
 Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin' 
 Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya 
 Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner 
 Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater 
 Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters 
 Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper 
 Almost a decade, quite impressive 
 Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for 
 Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams 
 But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens 
 Want me off the scene fast, but good things last 
 Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash 
 First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects 
 But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest 
  
 [Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] 
 Money is power, motherfucker! 
 I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch! 
  
 [Chorus 2: Puff Daddy] 
 You can hate me now, (I won't stop) 
 But I won't stop now (I can't stop) 
 'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me) 
 You can hate me now (I hate you too) 
 But I won't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 You can hate me now 
 You can hate me now 
  
 [Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy] 
 Do it now! I told you, do it now! 
 Let's go 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do 
 But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you 
 I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it 
 Now y'all sayin': "That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with." 
 Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG 
 People warn me, when you're on top there's envy 
 Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us 
 Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us 
 My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you? 
 Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too 
 Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code 
 Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho? 
 Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold 
 Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know 
 Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest? 
 Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right? 
  
 [Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] 
 You think I'ma come this far 
 And let you niggas stop me now? 
 I hate you too! 
  
 [Chorus 2: Puff Daddy] 
 You can hate me now, (I won't stop) 
 But I won't stop now (I can't stop) 
 'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me) 
 You can hate me now (I hate you too) 
 But I won't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 You can hate me now 
 You can hate me now 
  
 [Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] 
 I like this, I like the way this feels 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 It's a thin line between paper and hate 
 Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights 
 Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come 
 Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs 
 Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows 
 Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one 
 Took a little time to claim my spot 
 Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord 
 Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors 
 Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws 
 Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks 
 Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up 
 Niggas fear what they don't understand 
 Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man 
 Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin' 
 I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon! 
  
 [Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] 
 You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life 
 And that's what you can't understand! 
  
 [Chorus 2: Puff Daddy] 
 You can hate me now, (I won't stop) 
 But I won't stop now (I can't stop) 
 'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me) 
 You can hate me now (I hate you too) 
 But I won't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now) 
 You can hate me now 
 You can hate me now 
  
 [Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas] 
 You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!) 
 But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!) 
 It ain't gon' never stop, niggas![Produced by Noah "40" Shebib & Salaam] 
  
 [Intro: Guy sample] 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away 
 When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day 
 Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay 
 Something happens when you say I do, we go astray 
 Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all 
 Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault 
 He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living 
 Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women 
 Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck 
 Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up 
 No matter who you fuck, that was before me 
 Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming 
 "Hate you so much right now" 
 Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman 
 Actions of a demon, I'm leaving 
  
 [Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)] 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby) 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave 
 Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed 
 Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years 
 You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird 
 Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow 
 Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know 
 I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches 
 I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin 
 Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally 
 Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain 
 Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody 
 You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably 
 The highlight of my life, like "Ha, yo, look at my wife!" 
 Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night 
 Bailed you out, next morning we got clean 
 Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game 
 Just another day in the life of two people in love 
 But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what... 
  
 [Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)] 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby) 
 OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 I can't believe that this is happening to us 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition 
 Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending? 
 With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half 
 Not some, but half, no, serious, half 
 Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind 
 It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind 
 And all I seen was selfish cowards 
 Under their breath, saying, "Why did Nas trust her?" 
 But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh! 
 You live with your baby moms 
 And scared to make an honest woman out of her 
 And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive 
 At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride 
 Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride 
 He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes 
 Next go round I hope I pick the truest type 
 And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight? 
 Goodbye! 
  
 [Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)] 
 (Bye baby) Baby.. baby 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 I can't believe that this is happening to us 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 [Outro: Guy sample] 
 'Til we make love just one more time 
 Make it seem forever 
 This is our last and final goodbye 
 Goodbye[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream] 
 You'll live, and you'll learn 
 See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
 You'll love, and you'll learn 
 See you'll never conclude with anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 If I had everything, everything 
 I could change anything 
 If I changed anything, I mean anything 
 I would change everything, oh yeah 
  
 [Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West] 
 Dark boy, don't you cry 
 There's too much life left in those eyes 
 Don't you let that face go waterfall 
 Don't you learn to love your scars and all? 
 Dark boy, don't you die 
 They're just human, let them lie 
 You just know your world and speak your truth 
 Let them come to you 
 For you'll love, in your heart 
 See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
 This is your call, there are no wrongs 
 See you'll never conclude with anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 If I had everything, everything 
 I could change anything, I could change anything 
 If I changed anything, I mean anything 
 I would change everything, oh yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts 
 Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother 
 You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him 
 To my life, your life pales in comparison 
 So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God 
 Do what's necessary, I'm never worried 
 Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture 
 You convinced most of my people to live off emotion 
 That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel 
 Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest 
 You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that 
 We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac 
 People do anything to be involved in everything 
 Inclusion is a hell of a drug 
 Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life 
 And never have enough 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 If I had everything, everything 
 I could change anything 
 If I changed anything, I mean anything 
 I would change everything, oh yeah 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 From the birth of a child, the world is foul 
 Excursions of a searchin' child 
 Should learn to take nothin' personal 
 A parent hates to watch his baby's face 
 Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great 
 The child's introduction to suffering and pain 
 Understands without words, nothin' is explained 
 Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face 
 Like, "I thought you would protect me from this scary place?" 
 "Why'd you let them inject me?" 
 "Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?" 
 Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me? 
 If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me 
 I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso 
 Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position 
 Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin' 
 Said, "Screw that bus!" – boycotted that bus outta business 
 The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 If I had everything, everything 
 I could change anything 
 If I changed anything, I mean anything 
 I would change everything, oh yeah 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi 
 In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari 
 But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur 
 And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure 
 My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion 
 It was a haunted by dead rich whites 
 Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ 
 Circular driveways, black cars and black ice 
 My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money 
 Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny 
 Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria 
 What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior 
 Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky 
 It was important to a guy who was mob-minded 
 Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me 
 I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money 
 Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats 
 Just to remind me, just to inspire me 
 To stay focused, it's a real sick society 
 Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me 
 I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters 
 Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper 
 Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action 
 To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kanye West and The-Dream] 
 You'll live, and you'll learn 
 See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
 You'll live, and you'll learn 
 See you'll never conclude with anyone else 
 Don't think the same as everyone else 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 If I had everything, everything 
 I could change anything 
 If I changed anything, I mean anything 
 I would change everything, oh yeah 
  
 [Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West] 
 Dark boy, don't you cry 
 There's too much life left in those eyes 
 Don't you let that face go waterfall 
 Don't you learn to love your scars and all 
 Dark boy, don't you die 
 They're just human, let them lie 
 You just know your world and speak your truth 
 And let them come to you 
 For you'll love, in your heart

 Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts… 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now let's get it all in perspective 
 For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with 
 Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice 
 But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo 
 Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro 
 Only describe us as soldier survivors 
 Stay laced in the best, well-dressed 
 With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey 
 Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely 
 Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze 
 We can drive through the city, no doubt 
 But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out 
 Newness, here's the anthem 
 Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with 
 Push the pool stick in your new crib 
 Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid 
 King of the town? Yeah, I been that 
 You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at? 
 Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat 
 Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They shootin'! Aw, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up 
 Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at? 
 They shootin'! Aw, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up 
 Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop 
 Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot 
 My live niggas lit up the reefer 
 Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper 
 Don't start none, won't be none 
 No reason for your mans to panic 
 You don't wanna see no ambulances 
 Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup 
 That's the way you get Timberland'd up 
 Let the music defuse all the tension 
 Baller convention, free admission 
 Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift 
 Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept 
 All my just-comin' homies, parolees 
 Get money, leave the beef alone slowly 
 Get out my face, you people so phony 
 Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They shootin'! Aw, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up 
 Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at? 
 They shootin'! Aw, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up 
 Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude 
 I lay you out, show you what steel do 
 Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges 
 Every invitation to fight you punk-asses 
 Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa 
 Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma 
 Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers 
 Whatever you choose, whatever you do 
 Make sure he a thug and intelligent too 
 Like a real thoroughbred is 
 Show me love, let me feel how the head is 
 Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest 
  
 [Outro] 
 And I like a little sassiness 
 A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth

 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yo, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme! 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha 
 Get my crew to buy beers 
 And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh 
 Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly 
 Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies 
 After being blessed by the herb's essence 
 I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds 
 That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin' 
 Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection 
 Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly 
 Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G 
 I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll 
 Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella 
 Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops 
 Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes 
 When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop 
 Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top 
  
 [Chorus 2: Grand Wizard + Nas] 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 It sounds clever 
 Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit was phat 
 But kick that for them gangstas, man fuck all that! 
 Right, right 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 What up, niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain 
 I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin' 
 I'm tryin' to get this money, God 
 You know the hard times, kid 
 Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid 
 But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme 
 Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling "Free the mind" 
 And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places 
 As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us 
 But now I know the time, got a older mind 
 Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine 
 I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me 
 Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me 
 Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker 
 My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers 
 Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates 
 Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate 
 Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot 
 And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot 
 The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa 
 I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car 
 From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God 
 I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job 
 My brain is incarcerated 
 Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided 
 I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend 
 I contact eleven L's and max in heaven 
  
 [Chorus 3: Grand Wizard + Nas] 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 It sounds clever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yo, from '92 to '99 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah, that shit was crazy fat, pa 
 Know what I’m sayin'? 
 But check it, you got another verse for me 
 I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Kick that shit for the projects[Verse 1: Nas] 
 The ghetto Othello, the Moor 
 Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy 
 Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure 
 Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure 
 Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it 
 It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword 
 Journey far, learn who you can be 
 But you can learn who you are when you around family 
 Chip off their shoulders and soldiers, on they grizzle 
 My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little 
 They passed down wisdom, blessings were given 
 Pray my sins don't get passed to my children 
 I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star 
 Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are? 
 I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all 
 Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen 
  
 [Chorus: The-Dream] 
 Adam and Eve 
 Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy 
 Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve 
 Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The ghosts of gangsters dance 
 Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger 
 Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin' 
 The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum? 
 The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile 
 Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound 
 Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light 
 Brings awareness to my personal life 
 After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark 
 See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa 
 Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio 
 Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know 
 New girl every night, two girls was every other night 
 Sexual addiction, gangster tradition 
 They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended 
 Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended 
 I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth 
 As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah 
  
 [Chorus: The-Dream] 
 Adam and Eve 
 Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy 
 Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve 
 Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 What come first, peace or the paper? 
 Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor 
 Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors 
 Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit 
 No bacon, brothers is swine 
 It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine 
 It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin' 
 Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin' 
 Say somethin', you stay frontin' 
 But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings 
 You broke my heart, Fredo 
 You bring this thing of ours down to a fable 
 Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table 
 There's always room at my table 
 Insecurities is keepin' you disabled 
 All this money to get, is it less time? 
 They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine 
 I learned to stretch time, these are the best times 
 I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind 
 With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni 
 Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

 Street's disciple, my raps are trifle 
 I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle 
 Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split 
 Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit 
 Verbal assassin, my architect pleases 
 When I was 12, I went to… 
  
 [Hector] 
 And you're sitting at home doing this shit 
 I should be earning a medal for this 
 Stop fuckin' around and be a man

 [Intro: Nas & Big Kap] 
 (Y'all ready for Nas? 
 Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas? 
 Uh huh, they ready) 
 Yeah, word 
 Got some Rémy Martin 
 And some good-ass cigars, check it out 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle 
 Queensbridge leader, no equal 
 I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel 
 To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch 
 Smoke pot and heal the people 
 Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd 
 Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number 
 Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under 
 Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder 
 Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up 
 Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin' 
 The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars 
 Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes 
 Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size 
 I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous 
 It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought 
 The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy 
 Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me 
 They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em 
 Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety 
 Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades 
 I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage 
 I am the dragon 
 Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend 
 Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans 
 My little Jackie Onassis, dig? 
 I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib 
 Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege 
 Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid 
 Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive 
 Talk money, is you jokin'? 
 Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa 
 In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket 
 On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it 
 You envy, but don't offend me 
 I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley 
 You are your car, what could represent me? 
 Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly 
 Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's 
 Drug dealer car, rush to the bar 
 Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are 
 Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims 
 Pretty women see them saggin' 
 Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back 
 Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black 
 Light another blunt in fact, haha... 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 (Nasty) Nasty kid 
 (Nasty) Yeah... 
 (Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah... 
 (Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it 
 Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin' 
 Saying, "It was Nas I used to hustle with" 
 I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish 
 Guns on my waist, past this 
 Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin' 
 And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin' 
 Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted 
 Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly 
 I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin' 
 I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin' 
 Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys 
 Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors 
 For my team nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor 
 I’m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher 
 For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga[Intro: Nas & Puff Daddy] 
 Escobar season begins 
 Ayo, we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018 
 Candid shit only 
 Scared motherfuckers 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas & Puff Daddy] 
 Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go) 
 Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard 
 Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car 
 Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds 
 Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds 
 The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates 
 Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me 
 John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me 
 (You know God sent me here) 
 Fear will make you reveal who you really are 
 Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard 
 This ain't knowledge, this is not intense 
 For honored men, women too 
 Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go) 
 All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past 
 Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back 
 And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense 
 Show gratitude in the presence of dominance 
  
 [Chorus: 070 Shake & Nas] 
 I think they scared of us, yeah 
 I think they scared of us 
 I think they scared of us, yeah 
 I think they scared 
 To Catholics… 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas & Puff Daddy] 
 To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!) 
 John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it 
 Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved 
 Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation 
 (Fuck your proclamation!) 
 SWAT was created to stop the Panthers 
 Glocks were created for murder enhancement 
 For hunting men, circumstances 
 Edgar Hoover was black 
 Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack 
 The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!) 
 Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true 
 Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!) 
 Convinced my experiences were meant to be 
 Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery 
 Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable 
 "Am I good?" he ask, thinkin', "But is he testin' you?" 
 (Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things 
 Make you pussy, make you a snitch 
 Make irrational moves or even turn you to food 
  
 [Chorus: 070 Shake & Puff Daddy] 
 I think they're scared of us, yeah 
 I think they're scared of us 
 I think they're scared of us, yeah 
 I think they scared 
 I think they scared of us, yeah 
 I think they scared of us 
 See, we don't care about what you think about us 
 I think they scared of us, yeah 
 What you say about us 
 I think they scared 
 You bitch ass, yeah 
  
 [Outro: Puff Daddy] 
 Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us 
 That's why they feel uncomfortable around us 
 'Cause of our greatness 
 You're lucky God made us compassionate 
 And forgiving 
 Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas 
 We see that bitch in your eyes[Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Damn 
 Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga 
 Just use me for whatever the fuck they want 
 I don't get to say shit 
 Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want 
 Sell me, throw me away 
 Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right 
 Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit 
 It's like I'm a motherfucking gun 
 I can't believe this shit 
 Word up, word up 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I seen some cold nights and bloody days 
 They grab me and bullets spray 
 They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day 
 My body is cold steel for real 
 I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed 
 Under car seats they sneak me in clubs 
 Been in the hands of mad thugs 
 They feed me when they load me with mad slugs 
 Seventeen precisely, one in my head 
 They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead 
 I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns 
 Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly 
 Beat up and battered they pull me out 
 I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill 
 But what I feel it never mattered 
 When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired 
 A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves 
 Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred 
 Keeping me full up with hollow heads 
  
 [Chorus] 
 How you like me now? I go blaow 
 It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
 I might have took your first child 
 Scarred your life, or crippled your style 
 I gave you power, I made you buck-wild 
 How you like me now? I go blaow 
 It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
 I might have took your first child 
 Scarred your life, or crippled your style 
 I gave you power, I made you buck-wild 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Always I'm in some shit 
 My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised 
 Pull my skin back and cock me 
 I bust off when they unlock me 
 Results of what happens to niggas shock me 
 I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears 
 Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years 
 I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me 
 Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed 
 I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade 
 Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say 
 Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero 
 Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place 
 Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him 
 Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun 
 But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on 
 I make myself jam right in my owner's hand 
  
 [Chorus] 
 How you like me now? I go blaow 
 It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
 I might have took your first child 
 Scarred your life, or crippled your style 
 I gave you power, I made you buck-wild 
 How you like me now? I go blaow 
 It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
 I might have took your first child 
 Scarred your life, or crippled your style 
 I gave you power, I made you buck-wild 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised 
 Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides 
 Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine 
 There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying 
 Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear 
 He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career 
 Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf 
 His eyes bubbling, he said it was on 
 I felt his palm troubled him shaking 
 Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching 
 He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting 
 My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks 
 It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories 
 But this time, it's done intentionally 
 He walked me outside, saw this cat 
 Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?" 
 He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong 
 Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him 
 He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood 
 Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge 
 What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt 
 A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase 
 My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast 
 I didn't know he was hit, it's over with 
 Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming 
 Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me 
 Damn![Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample + together] 
 ("I wrote my way out") 
 When the world turned its back on me 
 I was up against the wall 
 I had no foundation 
 No friends and no family to catch my fall 
 Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt 
 I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way—" out 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I picked up the pen like Hamilton 
 Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em 
 No political power—just lyrical power 
 Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours 
 Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up 
 My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger 
 Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence 
 Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant 
 Flickerin' lights inside my project hall 
 Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long 
 And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on 
 Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds 
 Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at 
 I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app 
 I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens 
 The definition of what It Was Written means 
 Know what I mean? 
  
 [Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample + together] 
 ("I wrote my way out") 
 When the world turned its back on me 
 I was up against the wall 
 I had no foundation 
 No friends and no family to catch my fall 
 Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt 
 I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way—" out 
  
 [Verse 2: Dave East] 
 I really wrote my way up out of 6E 
 Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me 
 Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed 
 Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen? 
 At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains 
 Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses 
 Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit 
 The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch 
 Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans 
 Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border 
 That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape 
 Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak 
 I persevered, composition, I kept it close 
 Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear 
 Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it 
 Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin' 
 This poetry in motion, I'm a poet 
  
 [Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample] 
 ("I wrote my way out") 
 When the world turned its back on me 
 I was up against the wall 
 I had no foundation 
 No friends and no family to catch my fall 
 Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt 
 I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out! 
  
 [Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda] 
 High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck 
 Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check 
 My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak 
 In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back 
 Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin'; 
 "Oh, you think you smart?"—Blah!—start bleedin' 
 My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back 
 Sister tapped my brains, said, "Pssh—you'll get 'em right back." 
 Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in 
 The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless 
 These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless? 
 "Damn, you got no chill," fuckin' right—I'm relentless 
 I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery 
 So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery 
 This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers 
 And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and 
 Shine a light when it's gray out? 
  
 [Bridge: Aloe Blacc + sample + together] 
 ("I wrote my way out") 
 Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm 
 No lovin' arms to keep me warm 
 This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear 
 I can do without, I'm here (I'm here) 
 'Cause "I wrote my way—" out! 
  
 [Outro: Samples] 
 "—picked up the pen like Hamilton" 
 "I wrote my way out of the pro—" 
 "—wrote—" 
 "—wrote my way out of the projects" 
 "—pick—" 
 "—picked up the pen like Hamilton" 
 "I wrote my way out of the—" 
 "—wrote—" 
 "—wrote my way out of the—"

 "I wrote my way out of the pro—" 
 "—wrote—" 
 "—wrote my way out of the projects"

 [Chorus: James Brown sample] 
 Get, get, get down! 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uh.. uh.. uh.. 
 New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete 
 And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration 
 Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem 
 Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin' 
 Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s 
 But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities 
 Worldwide on the thorough side of things 
 Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time 
 One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat 
 40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me 
 "What you up to? The cops gon' bust you." 
 I was a teen drunk off brew 
 Stumbled I wondered if God sent him 
 'Cause two squad cars entered the block 
 And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched 
 I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair 
 Starin' at a young disciple 
 I almost gave my life to what the dice do 
 Yeah man, throwin' them bones 
 Hopin' my ace get his case thrown 
 His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein' 
 While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin' 
 They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof 
 The D.A. who tried him was lyin' 
 A white dude, killed his mother during the case 
 Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced 
 Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier 
 Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild 
 Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle 
 I wanna crack a smile when I see him 
 Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom 
 He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin' 
 Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, "Nobody leavin' 
 Everybody—" 
  
 [Chorus: James Brown sample] 
 Get down, get down! Get down, get down! 
 Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! 
 Everybody 
 Get down, get down! Get down, get down! 
 Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em 
 Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em 
 They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget 
 Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs 
 Southern niggas, independent label, real killers 
 Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin' 
 They had the coke game somethin' crazy 
 Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me 
 Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin' 
 Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him 
 Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me 
 I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy 
 Now I'm back around the old school that raised me 
 New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see 
 A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay 
 The letter say, "Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play." 
 I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral 
 Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho 
 Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital 
 Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too 
 See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs 
 He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano 
 Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano 
 She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile 
 Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed 
 Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in 
 But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit 
 I let the hammers blow, wet three kids 
 See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama 
 'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed 
 Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you 
 He responded "cool," but told me out here this how motherfuckers— 
  
 [Chorus: James Brown sample] 
 Get down, get down! Get down, get down! 
 Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! 
 Everybody 
 Get down, get down! Get down, get down! 
 Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! 
  
 [Outro: Salaam Remi] 
 All I really gotta say is that 
 If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?

 [Chorus] 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret 
 I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus 
 In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis 
 My actions are one with the seasons 
 A TEC squeezing executioner 
 Winter time I rock a fur 
 Mega popular center of attraction 
 Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing 
 They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson 
 City lights spark a New York night 
 Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini 
 Flipping mad pies, low price 
 I blow dice and throw them 
 .45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan 
 My niggas roll in ten M3's 
 Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis 
 Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll 
 Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold 
 I don't stunt, I regulate 
 Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate 
 I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex 
 Israelite books, holding government names from Ness 
 MC's are crawling out every hole in the slum 
 You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 For you wack MC's 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah 
 I'm spending it to get higher 
 Earth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm 
 Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early 
 Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves 
 Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise 
 I dolo, challenge any team or solo 
 You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough 
 Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up 
 Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up 
 Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy 
 I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily 
 This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma 
 In a sentence, paragraph's indented 
 Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye 
 Opening cigars let tobacco fly 
 Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof 
 Shitting like gin and prune juice 
 Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high 
 Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I 
 Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years 
 In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia 
 For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither 
 Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 For you wack MC's 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 For you wack MC's 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yo, the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation 
 Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing 
 Individual, lyrical math abrasion 
 Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation 
 We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives 
 A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized 
 Wise men build and destroy 
 While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy 
 Coke suppliers acting biased 
 'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars 
 But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired 
 I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's 
 Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC 
 Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler 
 Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow 
 Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow 
 Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes 
 Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those 
 Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it 
 My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses 
 And studded-up, thick medallions 
 Rich niggas transport in thousands 
 Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions 
 Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings 
 Trick bitches catching mad feelings 
 Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling 
 I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch 
 When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word 
 So now it's on, never wasted a slug 
 Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 For you wack MC's 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that 
 For you wack MC's

 [Verse 1] 
 PS 111 had free lunch 
 Embarrassed but managed to get a plate... 
 We was kids hungry 
 Mom's working, I was famished 
 She getting home late... 
 So I decided now I'm in charge 
 Either stay full or starve 
 Corner store like "Mister, spare-a-quarter" 
 Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars 
 Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard 
 Roll with a shooting squad 
 How could I not succumb? How could I not partake? 
 Fifteen, I got a gun 
 Sixteen, I robbed a train 
 Licked off a shot for fun 
 What's got inside my brain? 
 A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king 
 But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of 
 Dudes who switch up and change 
 They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame 
 I never let them though, I just forgive them though 
 Either that or the pistol blow 
  
 [Break: sample] 
 "Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah! 
 Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah 
 Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah 
 Worth two hundred million now 
 Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums 
 Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties 
 I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one 
 Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G 
 Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup 
 Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut 
 Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck 
 Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani 
 Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized 
 Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers 
 To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs 
 And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back 
  
 [Break: sample] 
 "Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah! 
 Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him 
 Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him 
 Girls all up on him 
 I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em 
 She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven 
 She says, it is the greatest loving 
 The tales you hear is the truth on me 
 Who wasn't the most faithful husband 
 Reveal my life, you will forgive me 
 You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me 
 Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real 
 They think it's just music still 
 Well I am a graphic classic song composer 
 Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure 
 Some of y'all might know Kelis 
 This goes to her with love, also goes to y'all, let's see 
 The craziest things already happened to me 
 So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, HA!

 (Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh... 
 Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors 
 Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners 
 Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home 
 Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone 
 She not the type deserving of a throne 
 Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse 
 Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone 
 I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome 
 Feel like a Knight from England 
 That's what I named my son, Knight 
 He was born to be one, that's how my game was won 
 White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue 
 I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one 
 Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options 
 Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with 
 Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed 
 She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh... 
 Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Even though I don't like you 
 Next Friday night can't wait to fight you 
 Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you 
 Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked 
 I felt bad, wait do I got love for you? 
 I might kill you but do I got love for you? 
 I want you dead under six feet of soil 
 At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery 
 We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery 
 Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy 
 We enemies but your hatred could never enter me 
 Some seek fame cause they need validation 
 Some say hating is confused admiration 
 Spotlight on me, I still look twenty 
 Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley 
 Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures 
 Through a nigga who realer 
 I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh... 
 Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh 
 Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...[Intro: Richard Pryor] 
 The cops used to come around in my neighborhood 
 "Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!" 
 Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night 
 They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12 
 And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs 
 And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something 
 'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right 
 Cops, "Ree, put your hands up, black boy!" 
  
 [Chorus: Slick Rick] 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I don't wanna hurt nobody 
 We just came here to party 
 See a few dames, exchange some names 
 I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane 
 The cop shot the kid, same old scene 
 Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain 
 Slap-boxin' in the street 
 Crack the hydrant in the heat 
 Cop cars on the creep 
 Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep 
 Yeah, it's hotter than July 
 It's the summer when niggas die 
 It's the summer when niggas ride 
 Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide 
 So y'all are blowin' my high 
 Type of shit that's killin' my vibe 
 White kids are brought in alive 
 Black kids get hit with like five 
 Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down 
 The disadvantages of the brown 
 How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids 
 Not the other way around? 
 Reminds me of Emmett Till 
 Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels 
  
 [Chorus: Slick Rick] 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– 
 The cops shot the kid 
 I still hear him scream 
  
 [Verse 2: Kanye West] 
 Stay tuned up and down your timeline 
 This fake news, people is all lyin' 
 Money is bein' made when a mom cries 
 Won't be satisfied 'til we all die 
 Tell me, who do we call to report crime 
 If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby? 
 It's certain things I can't abide by 
 I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side 
 Talkin' big shit, ready to die 
 I know every story got two sides 
 Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy 
 Cop wanna make it home by nighttime 
 Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy 
 Had a little hit, he wasn't that high 
 Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense 
 Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests 
  
 [Chorus: Slick Rick & Kanye West] 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (workin' nine-to-five) 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (tryna stay alive) 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (makin' ends meet) 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (shot him this week) 
 The cops shot the kid 
 The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–

 [Chorus] 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's looking for something 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square 
 Headed for Delaware with one change of gear 
 Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed 
 With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave 
 Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts 
 Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print 
 Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty 
 I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty 
 For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream 
 If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream 
 The first trip without the clique 
 Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it 
 Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes 
 I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes 
 God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million 
 Without the FBI catching feelings 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's looking for something 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat 
 Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back 
 Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back 
 Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet 
 Two sips from being alcoholic 
 Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich 
 But now I'm all for it 
 My man saw it like Dionne Warwick 
 A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with 
 The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
 Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina 
 Trina got the fishscale between her 
 The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her 
 She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar 
 Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins 
 Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM 
 Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's looking for something 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming 
 Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing 
 Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans 
 G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n 
 Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady 
 Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me 
 The street raised me up giving a fuck 
 I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up 
 I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody 
 Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy 
 Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money 
 With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry 
 A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years 
 Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career 
 But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt 
 With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese

 [Intro: Alabama 3 sample (Nas)] 
 Woke up this mornin' (yeah) 
 You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Got yourself a gun 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines 
 So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 And when I see you I'ma take what I want 
 So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My first album had no famous guest appearances 
 The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist 
 Many years on this professional level 
 Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine 
 Tattoo's real, with "God's Son" across the belly, the boss of rap 
 You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that 
 To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie 
 Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle 
 You lames a huddle, your team's shook 
 Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field 
 Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel 
 But the QB don't stand for no quarterback 
 Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft 
 And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in 
 It's for the hood by the corner store 
 Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines 
 So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 And when I see you I'ma take what I want 
 So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R 
 And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar 
 You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed 
 Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness 
 Bravehearted for life, it's 
 The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player 
 So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior 
 Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too 
 Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital 
 Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps 
 You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death 
 Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos 
 Call me "God's Son" with my pants low 
 I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo 
 This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow 
 What could beat that? Not a soul reppin' 
 Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines 
 So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 And when I see you I'ma take what I want 
 So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's, the, return of the prince, the boss 
 This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft 
 Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss 
 Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche 
 With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source 
 They don't know about the blocks I'm on 
 And everybody wanna know where the kid go 
 Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at 
 Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge? 
 Does he really know how ill that he is? 
 Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels 
 Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that 
 It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains 
 Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that 
 Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper 
 Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter 
 Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines 
 So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun) 
 And when I see you I'ma take what I want 
 So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)

 I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day 
 Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

 Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner 
 Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama 
 Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama 
 Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja 
 Word to the wise with villain state of minds 
 Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind 
 Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind

 Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up 
 Any ghetto will tell ya, "Nas helped grow us up" 
 My face once graced promotional Sony trucks 
 Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up 
 Gave my man my right, I could have went left 
 So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf 
 So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

 The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin' 
 Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin' 
 What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings 
 Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings 
 Criticize that, why's that? 
 ‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap 
 ‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens 
 Most intellectuals will only half listen 
 So you can't blame jazz musicians 
 Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues 
 Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee 
 You can't ice me, we here for life, B 
 On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey 
 And for that, we not taking it lightly 
 If hip hop should die, we die together 
 Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

 Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game 
 Reminiscing when it wasn't all business 
 It forgot where it started 
 So we all gather here for the dearly departed 
 Hip-hopper since a toddler 
 One homeboy became a man, then a mobster 
 If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka 
 RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta 
 Went from turntables to MP3's 
 From "Beat Street"to commercials on Mickey D's 
 From gold cables to Jacobs 
 From plain facials to Botox and face lifts 
 I'm looking over my shoulder 
 It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up 
 And they came to show love 
 Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 You cocked back 
 You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man 
 He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man 
 You missed him by inches, he sprinted 
 Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered 
 Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished 
 You took the life of him 
 The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him 
 Tight with him, why was he in the way? 
 Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day? 
 His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive 
 Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit 
 Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised 
 Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days 
 They never had no probs 
 Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage 
 These two different personalities had to collide 
 Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died 
 You ask why, 'cause of a

 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose

 You just an accident murderer 
  
 [Verse 2: Rick Ross] 
 We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated 
 Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded 
 Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars 
 But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up 
 20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight 
 We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night 
 Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war 
 Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah 
 Memoirs of a rich nigga 
 Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers 
 New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer 
 You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo 
 Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique 
 Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips 
 In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul 
 This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose

 Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up 
 Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya 
 And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome 
 How they gon' kill that beautiful sister? 
 Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons 
 Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing 
 Tell me who you impressing 
 Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them 
 Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling 
 Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping 
 But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went 
 Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas 
 Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless 
 Wish I could build with him, but will he change really? 
 Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry 
 Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me 
 You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose 
 Liars brag, you put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Streets are full of em, read the bulletin 
 Accident murderer 
 You just an accident murderer[Intro] 
 It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over 
 In the winters of my mind, yeah 
 This shit be real, man.. 
 Shit's crazy out here.. 
 Yo yo, yo what up y'all? 
 That's my niggas over there, word 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers 
 I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is 
 Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is 
 Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big 
 But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him 
 Body language is off, he's soft 
 But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin' 
 'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway 
 One look could tell me if you really came to kill me 
 Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli 
 Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree? 
 Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me 
 Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three 
 Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me 
 It’s a lesson every premonition 
 Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust 
 Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust 
 A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust 
 Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough 
 Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust 
 Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust 
 And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for? 
 Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war 
 This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off 
 I see your moms, she still speak 
 She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more 
 It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge 
 Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs 
 We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him? 
 Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread 
 Another day I put a family in black 
 Though I be calm and relaxed 
 Though I know somehow it will come back 
 Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life 
 What was it worth to see you covered in dirt? 
 It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted 
 Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide 
 Just tattoos of my niggas' names 
 I wonder, will it change? Let's ride… 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust 
 Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust 
 A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust 
 Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough 
 Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust 
 Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust 
 And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for? 
 Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position 
 A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions 
 From the mind of a man who went at it with killers 
 Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business 
 Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded 
 Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated 
 Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess 
 Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success? 
 They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best 
 'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex 
 Remember spray paintin' the word "fresh" and then starin' at it 
 Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it 
 Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it 
 Same old man from years ago told me life is short 
 So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment 
 Live with it and love it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust 
 Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust 
 A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust 
 Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough 
 Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust 
 Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust 
 And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for? 
 Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more[Intro] 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu 
 Look at the life that I've been through 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu 
 Look at the life that I've been through (uhh) 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars 
 Who you thought Kick in the Door was for? 
 But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit 
 Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start 
 Off top I brung Queens up from hard times 
 Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine 
 It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools 
 The crack epidemic had rap representin' the rules 
 So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them 
 Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em 
 Young murderers ride, I knew all them 
 Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin' 
 I wrote it in my album 
 I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and 
 My surroundings started changin', I had a baby 
 I was makin' my rounds with AZ 
 Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when 
 The Golden Child closed 'em in 
 With more style than them older men 
 Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang 
 Snoop and Dre had a new thing 
 So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects 
 He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit 
 Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark 
 Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts 
 He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox 
 Only niggas in New York with number one charts 
 Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon 
 My niggas, but dig it, they couldn't get along 
 That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape 
 Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait 
 Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang 
 And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing 
 But I borrowed from both them niggas 
 Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with "Ain't No Niggas" 
 Had much Versace swagger 
 Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper 
 Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit 
 There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu 
 Look at the life that I've been through 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu (uhh) 
 Look at the life that I've been through (yeah) 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin 
 Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on 
 There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song 
 There's some missing pieces I had to leave out 
 Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him 
 We old friends, but what's loyal? 
 Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve 
 And Steve thought the drama's on me 
 'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever 
 Friends forever 
 However, I learned, with some niggas it's all business 
 But I'm a street dude with morals 
 Then this nigga's with Jigga too much 
 He used to say Jay wanted my spot 
 I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot 
 A quiet man who used to be alone plannin' 
 Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it 
 She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets 
 With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong 
 I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow 
 Taught her street shit that I know 
 Her weakness was shine yo 
 But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger 
 Now I get my paper longer 
 Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed 
 One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores 
 In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus 
 QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems 
 I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama 
 She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her 
 We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs 
 I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong 
 In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack 
 Assassinate my character, degrade my hood 
 'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go 
 The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood 
 What y'all want, see, I already had 
 The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last 
 I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper 
 G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after 
 I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo 
 It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo... 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu 
 Look at the life that I've been through 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu 
 Look at the life that I've been through 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Intro: Kaye Fox & Hannah Sidibe] 
 Oooooh-ooooh-oooooooh 
 42nd Street Terminal 
  
 [Sounds of a subway train] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer 
 Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with 
 My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative 
 I can wish it into existing, God want this nigga to live 
 Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled 
 Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead 
 Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas? 
 The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas 
 They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this 
 Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this 
 Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest 
 War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma 
 Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey 
 Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply 
 Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice 
 Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery 
 Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with 
 Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst 
 I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous 
 This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous 
  
 [Break: Large Professor] 
 Yo, what we talking 'bout niggas? 
 What we talking 'bout niggas? 
 This is Nas, what, Nas 
 What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
 At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing 
 Integrity intact, repping hard 
 They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top 
 Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something 
 To keep winning is my way like Francis 
 As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances 
 A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs 
 Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head 
 So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start 
 So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart 
 I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece 
 But my life been good since I started finding peace 
 I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed 
 I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess 
 I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back 
 Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh 
  
 [Break: Large Professor] 
 My nigga's like a locomotive 
 Nas, we pushed it, mush it 
 Queensbridge to Bushwick 
 Harlem, Bronx, all that 
 You ain't even supposed to be here 
 You know where you at? 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 At night, New York, eat a slice too hot 
 Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth 
 Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot 
 Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot 
 I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching 
 Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching 
 When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught 
 Token man safe behind a locked door for sure 
 Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting 
 Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing 
 In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick 
 Bugging on how his imagination was so sick 
 It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth 
 Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies 
 How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me 
 Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease 
 I'm here y'all 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 This for my trapped in the 90s niggas 
 For my trapped in the 90s niggas 
 Ha for y'all niggas[Produced by Large Professor] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh uh, yo 
 They plan was to knock me out the top of the game 
 But I overstand they truth is all lame 
 I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame 
 Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name 
 Nas – too real, Nas – true king 
 It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing 
 Your arms too short to box with God 
 I don't kill soloists, only kill squads 
 Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas" 
 Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys 
 I seen it coming 
 Soon as I popped my first bottle 
 I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do 
 Came in with my style, so I fathered you 
 I kept changing on the world since "... Barbeque" 
 Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with 
 Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said 
 If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque 
 And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit 
 But look at me now, ten years deep 
 Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep 
 I never asked to be top of rap's elite 
 Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets 
 But look at me now 
  
 [Chorus: Sugar Man sample] 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars 
 And diamond rings can poison a rap star 
 Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye 
 I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky 
 Wish I could flap wings and fly away 
 To where black kings in Ghana stay 
 So I could get old, my flesh rot away 
 But that'll be the day when it's peace 
 When my gat don't need to spray 
 When these streets are safe to play 
 Sex with death, indulge in these women 
 Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire 
 Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina 
 Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds 
 I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me? 
 I'm your disciple, a thug certainly 
 I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R 
 If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar 
 .45 in my waist, staring at my reflection 
 In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion 
 When everything around me got cloudy 
 The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me 
 It was clear why the struggle was so painful 
 Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to 
 And God, I'm so thankful 
  
 [Chorus: Sugar Man sample] 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man 
 You're the man, you're the man[Produced by Buckwild] 
  
 [Intro: Nas] 
 Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet 
 Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients 
 That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and 
 You never knew how to make dollars 
 You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's 
 I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle 
 Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint 
 Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy 
 Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey 
 Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down 
 My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out 
 Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South 
 That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude 
 So I'm yelling, "Free my nigga!" 
 My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too 
 For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it 
  
 [Chorus: Victoria Monét] 
 Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been and what I do 
 No matter how you try you never can 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 And what I see, you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been, where I been 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver? 
 Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana 
 Or been shot in the medulla oblongata 
 And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided 
 Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods 
 Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all 
 N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit 
 Shell toes, slim, fly nigga 
 Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat 
 A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio 
 On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle 
 Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO 
 Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men 
 My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends 
 Dedication, hard work, routine builds character 
 In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers 
 Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it 
 Break through walls like Pink Floyd 
 And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all 
 Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes 
  
 [Chorus: Victoria Monét] 
 Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been and what I do 
 No matter how you try you never can 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 And what I see, you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been, where I been 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Now holla at a millionaire 
 Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear 
 Who to screw, what to drive 
 550 with the cream guts inside 
 Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly 
 Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch 
 Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys 
 Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties 
 If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside 
 Fuck it, I'ma die one day 
 They gon' probably make that day a holiday 
 Until then, let's go on a shopping spree 
 Speaking for my real niggas 
 Only OG's, certified who kill niggas 
 When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga 
 Chill mode, spill more Spades 
 Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay 
 It's like we always on the grind with no brakes 
 So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation 
  
 [Chorus: Victoria Monét (Nas)] 
 Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word) 
 'Cause where I'm from (yeah) 
 Man, what I see you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been and what I do 
 (Y'all wouldn't understand, huh) 
 No matter how you try you never can 
 (You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie) 
 'Cause where I'm from (yeah) 
 And what I see, you wouldn't understand 
 Where I been, where I been 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 True B nigga, yeah, uhh 
 For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah 
 To my man Eric B, what up, yeah 
 The whole city, I see you 
 To my man Big Slate in the fed joint 
 My man Spunk, free my niggas 
 All my niggas, yeah 
 Club Vernon, I see you, I see you, yeah 
 And Baltum, I see you[Produced by Salaam Remi] 
  
 [Intro: Nas] 
 Yeah.. 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison 
 Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison 
 Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison 
 Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison 
 Religion misoverstood is poison 
 Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little 
 Children and elderly women run for they lives 
 Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies 
 Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time? 
 Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace 
 You know, the usual, death comes in threes 
 "Life is short" is what some nigga said 
 Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did 
 And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us 
 Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison 
  
 [Chorus 2: Nas] 
 Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison 
 Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison 
 Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison 
 Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison 
 Religion misoverstood is poison 
 Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions 
 Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them 
 Up late night, on they mother's cordless 
 Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous 
 White girls tannin', liposuction 
 Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction 
 Light-skinned women, bi-racial 
 Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood 
 I don't judge Tiger Woods 
 But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs 
  
 [Chorus 3: Nas] 
 Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison 
 Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison 
 Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison 
 Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison 
 Religion misoverstood is poison 
 Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison 
 And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison 
 Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW! 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over 
 Every dog has its day, and everything flips around 
 Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em 
 Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes 
 Innocent lives will be taken 
 It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong! 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim 
 And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em 
 They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday "hell-day" 
 ‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy 
 Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas 
 Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last 
 I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab 
 This is my level, fuck if it get you mad 
  
 [Chorus 4: Nas] 
 It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison 
 Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison 
 How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison 
 Think about the kids you mislead with the poison 
 And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison 
 Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW! 
  
 [Bridge: Keon Bryce] 
 What goes around comes around, my nigga 
 And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga 
 The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga 
 Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga 
 What goes around comes around, my nigga 
 And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga 
 The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga 
 Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga 
  
 [Verse 4: Nas] 
 This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes 
 Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C 
 This is the problem, ‘cause he never tell 'em he got it 
 From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93 
 Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties 
 All the concerts, backstage where the stars be 
 Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork 
 What's your name? Where you from? 
 Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb 
 Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives 
 So they could never have babies and they could never be wives 
 He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya 
 Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS 
 I contemplate, believin' in karma 
 Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow 
 I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams 
 They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees 
 Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds 
 Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees 
 I pray for you, deadbeat daddies 
 'Cause when them kids get grown 
 It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on 
 It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars 
 Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas 
 What is destined shall be 
 George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me 
 Much blessings, be healthy, remember:

 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just 
 Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck 
 Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome 
 Definition of good nigga, yo 
 Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal 
 Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you 
 In front of you 
 It’s foul what this money could do 
 Cash corrupts the loyal 
 I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth 
 Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad 
 I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died 
 I just got out of his ride 
 He dropped me off and drove to Springfield 
 November 30th, another Queens king killed 
 It fucked me up, y’all 
 I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute 
 The legal way, drug-free route 
 Back in the days, they was sleeping on us 
 Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it 
 Trying to leave Queens out 
 But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out 
 Pumping bringing them D's out 
 Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house 
 Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth 
 Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings 
 Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children 
 Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood 
 Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though 
 Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo 
 A simple bet on a serious cash flow 
 Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro 
 Queensbridge unified all I ask for 
 Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo 
 I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery 
 Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai 
 The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery 
 Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries 
 You be starving in Kew Gardens 
 Bolognas and milk from a small carton 
 You could still feel chills from the team on 118 
 My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream 
 His face on his Shirt Kings 
 Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking 
 Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map 
 Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats 
 Thugs bark, getting amped from weed 
 Over the heart of champions, see 
 Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough 
 (You all know how the story GO!) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 "Any other real niggas in the world besides us?" I ask 
 Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths 
 Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot 
 And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory 
 Drinks in the air for my niggas not here 
 This how we do, I see you DU 
 Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends 
 Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets 
 Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows 
 Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow 
 I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93 
 Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little 
 Laid back in a rental 
 Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental 
 Nigga getting money now 
 But you know I'm still mental but not simple 
 Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot 
 And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory 
 Drinks in the air for my niggas not here 
 This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you 
 Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit 
 Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her 
 Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer 
 Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers 
 And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose 
 Liars brag they put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Better stay on point, if not it's curtains 
 Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably 
 If music money didn't stop me 
 I never claimed to be the toughest 
 Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed 
 It's the game that we was stuck with 
 Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids 
 Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went 
 No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket 
 It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket 
 Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit 
 Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went? 
 Old videos show niggas that was murdered since 
 Another reason to get further bent 
 Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot 
 And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory 
 Drinks in the air for my niggas not here 
 This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you 
 Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling[Verse 1: Nas & The World Famous Tony Williams] 
 (Bonjour) I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled 
 Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour) 
 How many girls pre-bate right before they date 
 So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour) 
 That's ill behavior, want the whip matted 
 Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket 
 A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor 
 Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

 Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour 
 Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous

 Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions 
 Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour) 
 Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches 
 Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (bonjour) 
 Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business 
 She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness 
 Laissez le bon temps rouler 
 Say ahh so the kids could play

 [Verse 3: Nas & The World Famous Tony Williams] 
 Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it 
 Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour) 
 All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor 
 You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours 
 All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute 
 If we don't invest it—we long-term affected 
 Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin' 
 I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin' 
 Flexin' 
  
 [Verse 4: The World Famous Tony Williams] 
 My head looks straight up 
 And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (bonjour) 
 She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?" 
 Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around 
 And walked back down the avenue (bonjour) 
 She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour) 
 I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour) 
  
 [Outro: The World Famous Tony Williams] 
 (Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour) 
 She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum 
 She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe 
 In that white gown that I be seein' right through 
 Crowd obscurin' my view 
 There's nothin' left to argue (bonjour) 
 At least there's not from my view (bonjour)[Produced by Salaam Remi] 
  
 [Intro: Anthony Hamilton] 
 Lies and the pain 
 Betrayal, life 
  
 [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton] 
 In danger’s face 
 Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away 
 And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain 
 All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away 
 In a world so cold 
 You gain your life just to lose your soul 
 Never thinking twice bout what the future holds 
 All the lies and the games not worth fighting for 
  
 [Refrain: Anthony Hamilton] 
 The world is an addiction 
 Serving up a fix 
 The world is an addiction 
 It's way too much for me 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest 
 Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets 
 They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me 
 Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat 
 Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef 
 Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed 
 Cause then you gotta murder dummies 
 Waste your time, they allergic to money 
 I'm never squirmish to blood 
 We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options? 
 Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping 
 Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking 
 Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose? 
 In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me 
 Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me 
 These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy 
  
 [Refrain: Anthony Hamilton] 
 The world is an addiction 
 Serving up a fix 
 The world is an addiction 
 It's way too much for me 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments 
 Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam 
 Guess how angry this man gets 
 Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex 
 Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits 
 He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick 
 Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption 
 Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing 
 Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms 
 All along he’s into bestiality porn 
 And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong 
 And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung 
 And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos 
 Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high 
 So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know 
  
 [Refrain: Anthony Hamilton] 
 The world is an addiction 
 Serving up a fix 
 The world is an addiction 
 It's way too much for me 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks 
 My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life 
 I'm just rebellious, not selfish 
 Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is 
 I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars 
 A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless 
 The other night, just in the emergency room 
 A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon 
 Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated 
 He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated 
 His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance 
 In the house they were married in, mad people waiting 
 Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching 
 Filling out an application cause they all need medication 
 But the doctor need love or a quick vacation 
 Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating 
 Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it 
 Some need Xanax just to maintain it 
 We all need faith cause the world keep changing 
 Let go of the illusion, start some restraining 
  
 [Outro: Anthony Hamilton] 
 Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh.... 
 Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh.. 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (just hold on) 
 Just hold on (... hold on)[Intro: Mano] 
 Y'all niggas better not be coming around me with that fugazi no more, you know? Got that thang for your ass, you know? 
 (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna 
 I'm gonna have to leave you) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A vet stylin' in Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala 
 Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer 
 God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater 
 When I fast, I see Elijah's features 
 A million cash for a Nas feature 
 Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me 
 52 bar verse if the beat is movin' me 
 Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free 
 Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep 
 Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993 
 Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter 
 Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga 
 I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news 
 I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you 
 You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build 
 You believe in your own lies, can't be real 
 And the odds is that what you love can kill you 
 Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack 
 I know the consumer behavior, I target that 
 You impressed with what they wearin', I started that 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick 
 Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich 
 And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin' 
 All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin' 
 A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut 
 Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt 
 The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front 
 We building businesses, you can be mad if you want 
 It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see 
 Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me 
 The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me 
 So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve 
 War of the Roses, it's war, baby 
 My nigga High said it's me, I drive 'em all crazy 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna 
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna 
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna)[Intro] 
 Light it, uhh 
 Light it up, uhh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The whole city is mine, prettiest Don 
 I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers 
 Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it 
 It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it 
 Write it, across the stomach spell "God son" 
 Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan 
 Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine 
 Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities 
 Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots 
 Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block 
 Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place 
 A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that 
 Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible? 
 A thug dies, another step inside his shoes 
 And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle 
 I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple 
  
 [Break] 
 Light it, light it, uhh 
 Yeah… light it up 
 Light it up, uhh 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Y'all just wanna deal with drama 
 Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama 
 Everything you into is underworld related 
 You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred 
 You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers 
 To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder 
 Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you 
 Everybody's under six feet of ground but you 
 Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real 
 You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill 
 You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready 
 Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly 
 The hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day 
 A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away 
 That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes 
 Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face? 
 Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God 
 Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars 
 Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror 
 Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya 
 Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny 
 He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many 
 Cold-blooded murderers, universal 
 Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple 
  
 [Break] 
 Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh 
 Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh 
 Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble 
 Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated 
 And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin' 
 When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail 
 Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin' 
 Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science? 
 People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd 
 And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him 
 Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'? 
 Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in? 
 It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots 
 Photograph pictures of suspect faces 
 It's usually two or three niggas who innocent 
 But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch 
 A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair 
 I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair 
 This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy 
 And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me 
 This is how I escape the madness 
 Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple[Produced by L.E.S & Wyldfyer] 
  
 [Intro: Jay-Z (Nas) & Both] 
 I know you can feel the magic, baby 
 Turn the motherfuckin' lights down 
 Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?) 
 I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha) 
 Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh 
 Turn the music up in the headphones 
 Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right) 
 Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!) 
 Make niggas mad and shit like 
 Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in! 
 Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka 
 Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)] 
 I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in 
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them 
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah) 
 Probably end up back in the hood, like, "Fuck it then" 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)] 
 Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?) 
 Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend 
 We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end? 
 Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things 
 Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang 
 Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain 
 We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game 
 Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring 
 Should blame, the game, and I could 
 It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain? 
 And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing 
 So the pressure for success can put a good strain 
 On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring 
 Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane 
 Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same 
 When you put in the game at age sixteen 
 Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing 
 Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings 
 It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching 
 The root of evil strikes again, this could sting 
 Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point 
 This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas] 
 I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in 
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh) 
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah) 
 Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then" 
 I feel like a black militant takin' over the government 
 Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah) 
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him 
 Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then" 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)] 
 I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (uh) 
 Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh) 
 Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s 
 Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies 
 Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies 
 Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "Why"? (uhh) 
 Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time 
 Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs 
 I'm standing on the roof of my building 
 I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it 
 Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire 
 Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire 
 Could it be the forces of darkness 
 Against hood angels of good, that form street politics? 
 Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh) 
 To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas] 
 I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in 
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh) 
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah) 
 Probably end up back in the hood, ah, "Fuck it then" 
 I feel like a black militant takin' over the government 
 Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them 
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him 
 Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"[Chorus]

 Yo we got chicks in the living room getting it on and

 But my name ain't Regis

 Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party 
 Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the army 
 Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky 
 Yeah, there go Jungle, eyes red looking for trouble 
 And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is? 
 The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz

 Yeah what up ma? Take a look, you hypnotized 
 On how my long dick stretch your insides 
 For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs 
 Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas 
 Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung 
 Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed 
 Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail 
 I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail 
 I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real 
 And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel 
 Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep 
 Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks 
 Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches 
 Me and my dog fucking them both they got us switching 
 Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm living 
 That's how I'm playing - I got these freak fucking hoes singing

 Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring 
 Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and 
 Grind from the side and fuck from behind and 
 Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying 
 Make her cum four times without even trying 
 I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying 
 Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat 
 Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap 
 Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag 
 No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs 
 Like no prob, it's simple 
 Holla out the window it's the project nympho 
 Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do 
 You got that good pussy I can share with my people 
 Be a brave girl, do your thang 
 Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying

 [Verse 4: Horse] 
 When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla 
 Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler 
 I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick 
 Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch 
 Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick 
 When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch 
 Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes 
 Who like the way I thug and the way I flow 
 I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe 
 Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof 
 Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth 
 Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot 
 Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on 
 Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on 
 I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone 
 Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

 So in God's Son we trust 
 'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want 
 They lookin' for a (hero) 
 I guess that makes me a (hero) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen 
 Crooks & Castle on his back, Maybacher 
 Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor 
 Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya 
 And of course I've been the boss since back when 
 Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz 
 Now they shut down the stores when I'm shoppin' 
 Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'—I'm him

 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Rubber-grip-holder, reloader 
 Come at me, I'ma rip your soliders in half 
 Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag 
 Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty 
 All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy 
 And every time I close my lids 
 I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge 
 I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see 
 Tell them angels open the door for me 
 From nine Berettas and movin' raw 
 To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors 
 That's what I call mature 
 That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp 
 That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit 
 I try to make more cream 
 By every September 14th, that's my dream 
 So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly 
 I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me (let's go!)

 This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side 
 Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it 
 First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it 
 But Newsweek article startled big wigs 
 They said "Nas, why is he tryin' it?" 
 My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin' 
 Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin' 
 Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow 
 Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel 
 They can't sing what's in their soul 
 So "Untitled" it is 
 I never change nothin', but people remember this 
 If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids 
 With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit 
 I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it 
 Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it 
 I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio 
 No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go! 
  
 [Outro: Polow da Don] 
 Yeah, Nas, Polow da Don[Verse] 
 Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done 
 Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son 
 Dog—whatever they call you—God, just listen 
 I spit a story backwards—it starts at the endin' 
 The bullet goes back in the gun 
 The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga 
 Now he back to square one, screamin', "shoot don't please" 
 I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit 
 He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up 
 I jumped back in the van and closed it shut 
 Goin' reverse, slowly prepared 
 My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, "go he there" 
 Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach 
 The smoke goes back in the blunt 
 The blunt gets bigger in growth 
 Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar 
 The blunt turns back into a cigar 
 We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans 
 Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC 
 I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first 
 Back upstairs, took off the black shirt 
 I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear 
 Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear 
 The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we" 
 So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat 
 Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you 
 'Cause Jungle said, "block your on enemy's the" 
 Hung up the phone, then the phone rang 
 I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing 
 Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug 
 She fell to my bed and gave me a hug 
 I told her, "no hell," she talkin' about, "me kiss" 
 Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick 
 Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit 
 Then got up and put her bra back on her tits 
 Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm" 
 Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind 
 Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice 
 I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice 
 The clock went back from three to two to one 
 And that's about the time the story begun 
 That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell 
 It said: "Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill." 
  
 [Outro] 
 *Beep* 
 Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me? 
 Listen, man, this dude right on the block 
 Right now, man, I found him, right now 
 I see him right now, let's kill him! 
 *Beep* 
 "Yo, this Nas, leave it: peace."[Produced by Al Shux & Dan Wilson] 
  
 [Refrain: Nikki Flores] 
 Just like a rose 
 Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
 But I feel a thorn on my hide 
 I should've known 
 We can't repair what we broke 
 But I held you close, too close 
 I should've left your roses at the door 
 They're sharper than before 
 And I don't want them no more 
 I should've left your roses at the door 
 They're sharper than before 
 And I don't need them no more 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I have no time to give you guidance 
 Barely have any fuck time either 
 Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but 
 I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver 
 Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her 
 Or if she insecure, most are 
 If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off 
 Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows 
 Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows 
 My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it 
 Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress? 
 A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness 
 Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet 
 If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever 
 Never played you, I prayed we would stay together 
 Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean 
 Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams 
  
 [Refrain: Nikki Flores] 
 Just like a rose 
 Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
 But I feel a thorn on my hide 
 I should've known 
 We can't repair what we broke 
 But I held you close, too close 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions 
 They some silent killers, that stress shit 
 That put ulcers in a lot of niggas 
 I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper 
 I done went to hell and back, you always think you right 
 You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight 
 When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right? 
 You resent me every time I make a million, right? 
 You want to experience life when you calling all the shots 
 Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot 
 Have your own cash, own your own Benz 
 Your own house, everything, me I understand 
 Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee 
 Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street 
 The first movie he made, thought that was fly 
 I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar 
  
 [Refrain: Nikki Flores] 
 Just like a rose 
 Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
 But I feel a thorn on my hide 
 I should've known 
 We can't repair what we broke 
 But I held you close, too close 
 I should've left your roses at the door 
 They're sharper than before 
 And I don't want them no more 
 I should've left your roses at the door 
 They're sharper than before 
 And I don't need them no more[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates] 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Or save it all for you? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I fill the tank up, put gas 
 And be out the front door in a (flash?) 
 Before reconsidering this hell with you 
 It ain't you, it's the things you do (do) 
 It's tearing my heart in two 
 I would've fell with you, to Hell with you 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates 
 Would you try to run inside when it opens 
 Would you try to die today? 
 Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power? 
 Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him 
 Would you still doubt Him? 
 How would you start actin'? 
 Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now? 
 Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin' 
 If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in? 
 To get away and escape from the craziness 
 And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist 
 It's hard takin' this, racist planet 
 Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff 
 Even if he innocent, "Nigga, get on the car! 
 Put your motherfuckin' hands up!" 
 Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo 
 Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard 
 And God, your young soldier's not so bold but needs you 
 This world's my home, but world, I will leave you 
  
 [Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates] 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Or save it all for you? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I fill the tank up, put gas 
 And be out the front door in a (flash?) 
 Before reconsidering this hell with you 
 It ain't you, it's the things you do (do) 
 It's tearing my heart in two 
 I would've fell with you, to Hell with you 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building? 
 I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren? 
 How I'm not gonna want to make millions 
 Since the quarter water days, in the hallways 
 Makin' fake gold caps 
 With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day 
 But then my style has quite a while 
 That same type as Ill and Al Skratch 
 Game time took 'em cats, never looked back 
 Cristal, blowin' dub sacks 
 That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys 
 Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me 
 I'd give it all away quickly 
 Just to hear them all about some new kicks 
 Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me 
 It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy 
 Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD 
 I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys 
 Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord 
 How could they do the Devil's work? 
 A man give another man head in Church 
 Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth 
  
 [Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates] 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Or save it all for you? 
 If Heaven was a mile away 
 Would I fill the tank up, put gas 
 And be out the front door in a (flash?) 
 Before reconsidering this hell with you 
 It ain't you, it's the things you do (do) 
 It's tearing my heart in two 
 I would've fell with you, to Hell with you 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 You trapped in your own hell 
 Every day I wake up I'm blessed 
 Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed 
 To all them niggas runnin' around 
 Talkin' about, "I'm fucked up," "I got to get on," "I got to…" 
 "I'm in the grind," "I'm fucked up" 
 Yeah, we all in the grind 
 But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life 
 All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up 
 Heaven's just a mile away 
 I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money 
 Got nothin' to do with nothin' material 
 I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart 
 In your own world, baby, in your own existence 
 To my moms, look at me, baby 
 I love you, girl, your boy's shinin', God's son...[Intro] 
 Alchemist, you know me, man 
 I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes 
 Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Word, but I wanted to bring 
 A couple of books to the studio today, man 
 I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man 
 I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits 
 Or what's in these shits, man 
 Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 How can I trust you when I can't trust me? 
 Picture myself a old man, a O.G. 
 Some niggas will conversate with liars all day 
 Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else) 
 Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns 
 I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns 
 I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first 
 I thought I was abnormal 
 ‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to 
 So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames 
 Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game 
 Your rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue," it kinda supports 
 Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue 
 Rarely y'all come in contact with the real 
 Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel 
 Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life 
 Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes 
  
 [Break] 
 Oh shit, Tina! 
 I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn 
 No, this rhyme is weak 
 This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Gandhi was a… what the fuck? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death 
 The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest 
 (I wonder when I wrote this… nah, it's weak) 
 The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life 
 Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife 
 The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream 
 Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king 
 Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck 
 Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society 
 Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety 
 Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms 
 Beautiful ladies on their arms 
 Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas 
 Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique 
 Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be 
 Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares 
 (Nah, that was weak there) 
 My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale 
 Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell 
 It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real 
 I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies 
 I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style 
 And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit 
 I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie 
 My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap 
 This can't be my book of rhymes 
  
 [Break] 
 This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit! 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Nah, neva that! Fuck that! 
 Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist? 
 Hah, you a funny nigga... 
 Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes) 
 I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now 
 Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that! 
 I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood 
 Our values so low, our values are no good 
 Things our mothers told us we should've heeded 
 ‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t— 
 I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful? 
 Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit 
 Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile 
 And things come your way 
 Such a innocent child is what some say 
 I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are 
 Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far 
 But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention 
 I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)[Intro] 
 But that's the whole, tragic, point my friends! 
 What would I do if I could suddenly feel 
 And to know once again that what I feel is real? 
 I could cry, I could smile 
 I might lay back for a while 
 Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I was young, I was survivin' the times 
 Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine 
 Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next 
 Wantin' bracelets, never had a rope on my neck 
 Unless I was holdin' Taiyeh chain – Rest In Peace 
 Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us 
 If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners 
 Movin' on to move your arm in your watch 
 To another time on the block 
 ‘Cause this 40 Side where they say shorty rhyme 
 Tragedy, he used to come through all the time 
 I'm talkin' Juice Crew, not what the word define 
 He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine 
 That was my first crush, I bought my first mic 
 I wrote my first verse, I was about nine 
 I was about mine, fantasize house buyin' 
 Met Paul, he wore some big glasses 
 Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived 
 I was happy just gettin' some answers 
 I ain't even know what a record advance was 
 I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom 
 With rap dudes, thinkin', "Wow, she moved me!" 
 Same girl then right now's a groupie 
 Back then she was like the star in a movie 
 Large jewelry and expensive Gucci 
 Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me 
 Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie 
 Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me 
 You see, every time Ra didn't show 
 I get to record demos at attempts to blow 
 I wonder, could they tell? How did they know? 
 Sixteen years later, here I go 
  
 [Chorus: Nipsey Russell] 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal 
 G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill 
 But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted 
 Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us 
 Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted 
 Reef and Matty C offered me a little money 
 Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter 
 Rebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper 
 My boy MC Serch, nevertheless 
 Took me to Columbia, back then CBS 
 Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man 
 Now buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam 
 Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man? 
 But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram 
 Life is ill, again life's a movie 
 Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees 
 Before I sold records, no promotion 
 The rap world like, "What's all this commotion?" 
 Went plat, mad bottles I'm toastin' 
 20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then? 
  
 [Chorus: Nipsey Russell] 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Invincible, lyrical, miracle man 
 Uh, but back to the matter at hand 
 ‘Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25 
 Some cats didn't make it alive 
 Dated some stars but respect their privacy 
 Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat 
 Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel 
 Here I am, completed my whole record deal 
  
 [Chorus: Nipsey Russell] 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
 "What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 
  
 [Outro] 
 What would I do 
 If I could reach inside of me 
 And to know how it feels 
 To say I like what I see?[Produced by Jay Electronica] 
  
 [Verse] 
 Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper chasing 
 Where presidential candidates is planning wars 
 With other nations, over steak with Masons 
 Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters 
 They daddies faceless 
 Play this by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it 
 I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it 
 Tell him his name's Nasir, tell him how he got here 
 Mama was just having fun with someone above her years 
 Niggas is still hating, talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming 
 He'd rather floss with diamonds 
 They pray "Please God, let him spit that Uzi in the army lining 
 That shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining" 
 Take 27 emcees put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment 
 My assignment since he said retirement 
 Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic 
 Gets rich but dies rhyming 
 This is high science 
 Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more 
 I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw 
 Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time 
 Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones 
 .80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone 
 The mack left his iPhone and his 9 at home 
 My queen used her Milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses 
 I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses 
 This that nigga shit that's on the album 
 For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses 
 Bring back Arsenio 
 Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo 
 Let us make man in our image, spit it, I'm Huey P in Louis V 
 At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett 
 And you ain't as hot as I is 
 All of these false prophets is not messiahs 
 You don't know how high the sky is 
 The square mileage of Earth or what pi is 
 I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire 
 The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the Towers[Produced by DJ Hot Day, Rodney Jerkins & Salaam Remi]

 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove 
 Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby 
 I see you standing there 
 So lost and all alone 
 I wanna take you in my arms 
 And tell you that you’re home 
 I look into your eyes 
 I said I know you very well 
 I see a mirror of my life 
 A reflection of myself 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream 
 I'm stuck, money problems pop up 
 How will I survive? 
 Guess it's best to decide not to decide 
 So that's my decision 
 Whatever happens happens 
 I keep making my millions 
 Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners 
 But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members 
 When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles 
 And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you 
 And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest 
 And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with 
 Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror 
 And leave notes around for yourself to remember 
 I like to teach and build 
 With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil 
 All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time 
 Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein 
 It’s all in the mind 
 Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic 
 Just one minute after it's heard 
 You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it 
 You'll call me a genius, if you didn't 
 Now that I said it I forced you to think it 
 Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët 
 Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best 
 When I was young they called me Olu's son 
 Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed 
 He was the wise gardener 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove 
 Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby 
 I see you standing there 
 So lost and all alone 
 I wanna take you in my arms 
 And tell you that you’re home 
 I look into your eyes 
 I said I know you very well 
 I see a mirror of my life 
 A reflection of myself 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yeah, what y'all know about this.. 
 Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas 
 Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics 
 The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness 
 Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness 
 So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious 
 Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic 
 Try to compare what you live to the life I master 
 See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after 
 Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces 
 White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation 
 The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker 
 Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper 
 I describe it, hope you can visualize it 
 This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project 
 When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites 
 Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet 
 Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet 
 Ha ha ha 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove 
 Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby 
 I see you standing there 
 So lost and all alone 
 I wanna take you in my arms 
 And tell you that you’re home 
 I look into your eyes 
 I said I know you very well 
 I see a mirror of my life 
 A reflection of myself

 You remind me, ohhhhhhhhhh 
 Yes it's true baby, ahh yeah[Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Uhh.. yo 
 Whattup? Whattup? 
 It's time man (word, it's time?) 
 Straight up (it's time, man) 
 Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga) 
 Set it off (set if off) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors 
 Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors 
 Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator 
 Why not? It might've saved me later from my block 
 N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin' 
 Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin' 
 But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans 
 Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart? 
 Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog 
 To my building—come out later wearin' camouflage 
 See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men 
 Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare 
 With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet 
 Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews 
 Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant 
 Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested 
 Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7 
 7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven 
 6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick 
 The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick 
 When he went O.T., college life 
 Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin' 
 Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around 
 We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit 
 Fake shit—beat his ass down 
 Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown 
 All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends 
 And we all goin' out to the death for these ends 
 What? 
  
 [Chorus (repeats in bridge)] 
 New York, New York (New York state of mind) 
 New York, New York (New York state of mind) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 You heard about it, you see about it 
 You read about it, it's in your papers 
 It's in your daily news ("Get money!") 
 New York chronicles, every day 
 The crime rate, the murder rate 
 The money rate, the paper chase (aight?) 
 You know what I mean? 
 New York state of mind, baby (oh, yeah) 
 Check it out (yeah) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot 
 New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot 
 I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox 
 You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox 
 Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along 
 All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs 
 Hoodrats flashin' they tongue 
 Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations 
 Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation 
 Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues 
 I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave 
 'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit 
 Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks 
 Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas 
 Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you 
 Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years 
 Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers 
 That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears 
 Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid 
 Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids 
 Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live 
 Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South 
 Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths 
 All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s 
 Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy 
 To score but it's hard to get the shit off 
 Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off 
 When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell 
 Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale 
 Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors 
 Go to any hood that's live and make it liver 
 A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin' 
 But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The ill reminisce and think about the fly days 
 Nothing like them 80s summer NY days 
 Hop on the MB5 days 
 Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways 
 How it all started, fifth floor apartment 
 A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects 
 A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners 
 Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages 
 Check out the oracle bred from city housing 
 Nas, I arise the dead by thousands 
 I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi (near his Audi) 
 Hollis had Run and them but I proudly 
 Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid 
 You love to hear the story how it started 
 The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet 
 Before there was an audience to watch us 
 I assure you there was a process, yeah

 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct 
 Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink 
 At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way 
 Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates 
 Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow 
 It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke 
 Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing 
 How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man 
 I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon 
 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street 
 Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials 
 Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true 
 Who possesses the testicular fortitude 
 To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you 
 You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race 
 The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews 
 It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical 
 Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed 
 And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve 
 That's why I hate doing interviews 
 But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw 
 My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing 
 I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man 
 I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten

 Back when (back when), back when 
 Back when, (back when) back when"[Verse 1] 
 Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold 
 I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe 
 When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast 
 To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets 
 Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun 
 Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son 
 Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, nonchalantly 
 I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me 
 While, funny style niggas roll in the pile 
 Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle 
 Holdin’ weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life 
 Gettin' props is a true thug's wife 
 It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in 
 Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again 
 From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable 
 Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual 
  
 [Hook] 
 Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

 It's like a whole new beginning... 
 Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

 Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

 [Verse 2] 
 Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture 
 Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya 
 They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless 
 So he curses, his mom saying Bible verses 
 That's all she works with 
 But miracles never leave the churches 
 Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase 
 A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool 
 I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel 
 To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to 
 Respect this and all respect due is the essential 
 To street life, hustlin’, the struggle, broke ghettos 
 Boiling coke settles slow inside a glass kettle 
 Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of living easy 
 Got my crew tense, plottin’ to jips, to get whips with BBs 
 Pushing cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates 
 Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make 
 So How You Like That? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

 It's like a whole new beginning...

 [Verse 3] 
 Escobar life, gems and raw Tims 
 Gators for pretty boy haters 
 In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes 
 I'm glistening, housing cops whistling 
 Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin 
 95-I, I drive high, zoning 
 Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash not, teeth golden 
 Look at me now, Ma 
 Blowin’ but for how far? 
 Cars, cash, and bitches got me out more 
 And things you never dreamed I can vouch for 
 Snake niggas slither on the A-alikes 
 I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike 
 Never the one to ask for the time to a saint 
 A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink 
 Down a canal, similar to how we drink 
 Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links 
 Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times 
 Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, give me mine 
  
 Déjà vu....[Intro: Justin Vernon sample] 
 And I know where I'm going to 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I'm lookin' in Longevity's eyes 
 I play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy 
 My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I 
 I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly 
 Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase 
 Without production I'm worthless 
 But I'm more than the surface 
 Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40 
 I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me 
 I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students 
 Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music 
 Was lovin' women you'll never see 
 All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities 
 Damn, look at the jealousy! 
 Lucky me, I meet some beauties 
 Make you wanna shoot me 
 Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie 
 Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes 
 Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G 
 Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed 
 One of my exes could be your next, dog—trust me, don't test 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 It's the simple things in life, simple things in life 
 Simple things in life, simple things in life 
 It's the simple things in life, simple things in life 
 Simple things in life, simple things in life 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Rollin' dice, throw no aces 
 With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres 
 Other safe bets, nothin' regular or basic 
 Ridin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships 
 Where the squad at? 
 You can see us on the ave, chop it up as always 
 Stand up Queensbridge, now the world know us 
 Everybody sayin' my humility's infectious 
 I just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with[Produced by Trackmasters] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 They never realized how real Nas is so decisive 
 It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this 
 A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime 
 Food for thought or rather mind wine 
 The Don Juan features the freak shit, my thesis 
 On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret 
 It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me 
 I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story 
 There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me 
 My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me 
 Where the snakes put a smile on they face 
 Hoping and praying I'm stuck 
 Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck 
 Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages 
 Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges 
 Really it's papers I'm addicted to 
 Wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you 
 The Mag inside the Triple Goose 
 Face down on the floor's the routine 
 Don't want hear nobody blow steam 
 Just cream or it's a smoke screen 
 Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps 
 I zone, to each his own in this ghetto inhabitant 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown] 
 Watch dem niggas that be close to you 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
 Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
 Watch dem niggas that be close to you 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
 Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Now how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?) 
 Living reckless, die for my necklace 
 Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish 
 Jetting, checking my message on the speaker 
 Bopping to "Mona Lisa", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa 
 CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt 
 No seatbelt, drinking and thinking 
 My man caught a bad one son, niggas is frightened 
 Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightment 
 My Movado says seven, the God hour that's if you follow 
 Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo 
 My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo 
 Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown] 
 Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
 Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
 Watch dem niggas that's close to you 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
 Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Some niggas watch you (uhh) 
 See you when you think you on the low 
 Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow 
 Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho 
 Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough 
 Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead 
 Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head 
 Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine' 
 At the same time your ho is getting snatched from behind 
 Put in a van, where's the hundred grand, strippin' her hand 
 From all the ice, wouldn't you know 
 You knew these niggas all your life 
 What made them mark you victim 
 You fucked up somewhere down the line 
 Now they had to target your Wisdom 
 She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe 
 You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping 
 Jump in your ride, headed to your side 
 Puffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her 
 Just a reminder: shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out 
 Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out 
 Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown] 
 Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh) 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah) 
 Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh) 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
 Watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh) 
 And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
 Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh-huh) 
 Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways (uhh)[Intro] 
 One more time, one more time 
 Uh, one more time 
 Uh, one more time 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born 
 Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom 
 Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven 
 My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song 
 I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion 
 Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced 
 The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin' 
 Past the Milky Way and all the planets 
 There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows 
 Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though 
 That was part of our conversation 
 I spark one up and start blazin' 
 Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love 
 I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real 
 I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills 
 But Mom, you could never be replaced 
 I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have— 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 If I could only have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 Praying, wishing that I could have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 If I could only have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe 
 You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free 
 A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white 
 Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right 
 If only I could hear your voice and your laughter 
 Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine 
 April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up 
 For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones 
 Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood 
 You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good 
 Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren 
 Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him! 
 And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced 
 They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist 
 I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes 
 Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have— 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 If I could only have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 Praying, wishing that I could have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
 If I could only have 
 One more dance with you, Momma 
  
 [Outro] 
 I love you forever, Mom 
 You will always live through me, always 
 Uh, uh, uh, yeah[Intro] 
 [Girl 1] Hello? 
 [Girl 2] Whassup girl

 [G2] What, that God Body shit? 
 [G1] Yeah, that dumb shit 
 I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here 
 [G2] I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight

 [JoJo Hailey] 
 Listen.. to reason 
 Pretty baby baby listen 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas (JoJo Hailey)] 
 A young wild beautiful love child 
 You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping 
 Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping 
 The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine 
 Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick 
 You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit 
 Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails 
 Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..) 
 To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me 
 The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me 
 Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle 
 Way too many Willies all in one hand 
 You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on 
 Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear 
 Get your fuck on - following week, you back there 
 But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars 
 Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out 
 Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas 
 Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave 
 What up ma, fronting like you naive 
 Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip 
 Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us 
 But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word! 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)] 
 Diamonds all shining, looking all fine 
 Pretty little face, get a little high 
 Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive) 
 Mother of the Earth, she made you and I 
 Just tired of playing the same ol' games 
 Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind) 
 (And there goes.. a black girl.. lost) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas (JoJo Hailey)] 
 Like Isis, you got your heart broke and felt lifeless 
 Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest 
 To who'sever getting down and trifless 
 To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless 
 Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs 
 More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah) 
 There you go again, startin wars, making me more yours 
 Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours 
 Face glistening, I'm addicted to you 
 Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you 
 Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen 
 To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets 
 Must've had a bad deal in the past though 
 Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow 
 Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain 
 You got a job part-time and school's your night thing 
 With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now 
 You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed 
 Typical day that the black girl sees 
 Coming home wanting more from a college degree 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)] 
 Diamonds all shining, looking all fine 
 Pretty little face, get a little high 
 Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive) 
 Mother of the Earth, she made you and I 
 Just tired of playing the same ol' games 
 Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind) 
 (And there goes.. a black girl.. lost) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas (JoJo Hailey)] 
 Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is 
 Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless 
 Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you 
 Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to 
 More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you 
 You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to 
 Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off 
 So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed) 
 Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you bein lied to 
 Everything that move be inside you 
 Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you 
 I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to 
 They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers 
 Damn look, there goes a black girl lost 
  
 [Outro: JoJo Hailey] 
 You should be ashamed of yourself 
 The way you carry yourself 
 The way you hang out all night long 
 Doing silly things that is wrong 
 Black girl lost[Produced by L.E.S] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh... 
 Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice 
 At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights 
 Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars 
 Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards 
 Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd 
 'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob 
 I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45 
 'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride 
 Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin' 
 Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin' 
 Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin' 
 To the concrete jungle of cement 
 Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin' 
 Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when 
 Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went? 
 Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure 
 Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door 
 Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low 
 My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo 
 To the back, she must be inside and can't hear 
 Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair 
 I walked in through the back door entrance 
 Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense 
 Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses 
 And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas 
 A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands 
 Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it 
 Swingin' slower and slower 
 On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter 
 Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it 
 Started my way up to where the noise and music was at 
 Froze, I couldn't react 
 Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga 
 Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass 
 And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses 
 Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit 
 Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound 
 I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun 
 Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do? 
 Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I thought you loved me 
 I thought you cared for me 
 I thought you needed me 
 Did you believe in me? 
 I thought you loved me 
 I thought you cared for me 
 I thought you needed me 
 Did you believe in me? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost 
 I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off 
 "Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?" 
 I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip 
 Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play 
 To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway 
 I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years 
 What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is 
 Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz 
 I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid 
 I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me" 
 Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me 
 Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement 
 20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with 
 My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me 
 We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly 
 Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us 
 Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater 
 Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped 
 Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot 
 Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in 
 Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend 
 One between the eye, she's died, by mistake 
 Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face 
 Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies 
 Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze 
 We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside? 
 Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide 
 Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love 
 Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back 
 Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on 
 Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms 
 Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin' 
 Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin' 
 To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial 
 Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin' 
 I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed 
 This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene 
 On that note, same time, the cops busted in 
 Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen" 
 Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close 
 Squeeze the toast, said to her, "Now unto God, we elope" 
 .. we elope

 He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile 
 Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul 
 You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories 
 First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory 
 Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor 
 Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar 
 Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever 
 Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega 
 Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that 
 (But it's so hard) to put a coward's name in my rap 
 Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin' 
 He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin' 
 But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren 
 Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him 
 Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real 
 Still laughin' to the bank and shit 
 Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack 
 Def Jam mad that he signed the contract 
 Now he got jealous and mad at my shine 
 Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind 
 Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid 
 Mega for the record you could suck my dick 
 Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me 
 But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity 
  
 [Refrain] 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it 
 So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it 
 So they say 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies 
 Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies 
 There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot 
 Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot 
 Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul 
 Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog 
 Through the ups and downs, robberies and all 
 Though I always knew he wanted my downfall 
 He would say his little slick shit and act real funny 
 For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me 
 Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry 
 You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B 
 Nature moved to Marcy 
 (Man dick riding Nature) nothing else to say 
 Man Nature moved to Marcy (far.. far away) 
 (Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas 
 Go head with the program man proceed) 
 Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief 
 Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks 
 Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas 
 Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger 
 Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot 
 And get filthy rich, its just not 
 No more morals, no loyalty, no more community 
 Queensbridge, we gotta have unity 
  
 [Refrain] 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it 
 So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it 
 So they say 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan 
 Q.B. before the ROC had one jam 
 Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef 
 Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak 
 So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard 
 Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed 
 P, how many times ain't you shamed that 
 Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back 
 They don't respect you a cheque's due for me for your fame 
 Mega I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega) 
 Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King 
 Even Jigga want the crown: "How that sound?" Poor thing! 
 I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A 
 Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay 
 All you little roaches and rats 
 Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back 
 So haters say 
  
 [Refrain] 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it 
 So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it 
 They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over) 
 Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it 
 So they say 
  
 [Outro] 
 "The Bridge is over," my dick! 
 The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'! 
 Braveheart to the graveyard! I'm the William Wallace of this shit 
 Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle! 
 You can't save everybody! 
 Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga! 
 Be untouchable, my nigga 
 So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real! 
 Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man! 
 I'm not your father, man! 
 Be your own man, stand on your own two! 
 I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga 
 Or dont even rep this, man! 
 Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta? 
 There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man! 
 Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man? 
 Niggas be buckin'! 
 Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man? 
 All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood? 
 It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines! 
 Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth! 
 There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin': 
 That means the cowards get out, and real niggas stay! 
 Niggas been hating me since I been nine 
 Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks 
 I'ma always be the young don 
 Don't be like the niggas on the other side: 
 Hating me cause I'm beautiful! 
 Real niggas in Queensbridge: 
 You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby! 
 Q.B[Intro] 
 Turn your radios up 
 You are now allowed to listen to the radio 
 The real niggas are back on the radio 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin' 
 No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor 
 No answers to questions the media's askin' 
 Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists? 
 They love it; puttin' old niggas verse the youngest 
 Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas 
 There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas 
 Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas 
 Not mad 'cause Eminem said, "Nigga," 'cause he my nigga 
 Wigga, cracker, friend - we all black within, okay? 
 We all African, okay 
 Some Africans don't like us no way! 
 A killing happened in Johannesburg, yesterday 
 Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked 
 Some say N-double-A-C-P, keep us sidetracked 
 But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins 
 Faster cars than, NASCAR cars and, sparkin' while ridin' 
 Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich 
 With this N-word jargon I'm just startin', bitch! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers 
 Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too? 
 To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers 
 That's right, y'all my niggas, too 
 I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers 
 Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too 
 They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers 
 Still you wanna be a nigga, too? True 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet 
 Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with 
 Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you 
 If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'ma get you 
 I'm official not "A-Tisket" or "A-Tasket" 
 I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet 
 They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed 
 Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up 
 I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who be hatin' us? 
 I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust 
 'Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers 
 I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters 
 Clique still movin' like Freemasons 
 So if I'm on the flow for the law, there's lodges all across the nation 
 Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand 
 Dragon's head in my hand, come and get me, here I am 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers 
 Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too? 
 To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers 
 That's right, y'all my niggas, too 
 I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers 
 Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too 
 They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers 
 Still you wanna be a nigga, too? True[Produced by Swizz Beatz]

 Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening? 
 Just rolled four with them, 'bout to smoke again

 It's single season, they choosing who to mess with 
 I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it 
 Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps 
 My people in the streets, I make it feel like it’s the beach 
 My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach 
 I’m protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech 
 Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets

 Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash

 Bad bitches, champagne wishes 
 Freaks only baby, let me take pictures 
 Skin, sin, wait, do you know whose pool you're in? 
 Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill 
 Your body is a weapon that you can’t conceal

 [Sampled hook and Kanye intro] 
 Some people really 
 Some people really 
 Some people really are still dreaming 
 As the sun sets 
 And the night falls 
 And them hoes call 
  
 [Verse 1: Kanye West] 
 He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745 
 As he waving "Shorty, hi", you know he showin' his bling out 
 She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out 
 His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out 
 How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out 
 Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out 
 When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout? 
 If y'all get a divorce 
 She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out 
 Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out 
 Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out 
 You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle 
 Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now 
 Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out 
  
 [Adlibs over sampled hook] 
 One two, one two 
 Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true 
 One two, one two 
 Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true 
 Some people really 
 Some people really 
 Some people really are still dreaming 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich? 
 Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick 
 So if he feed your family and he serve you shit 
 Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch 
 Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life 
 Dwellin' on the past when you was alright 
 When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright 
 Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells 
 Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self 
 Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green 
 I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream? 
 Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen 
 With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing 
 How high was I? You the thousandth guy 
 That came around thinking we can see eye to eye 
 We on a different echelon 
 Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on 
  
 [Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 She had several cars, she had credit cards 
 A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure 
 Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who 
 Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools 
 And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news 
 But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 
 ‘Cause I knew her since high school 
 Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew 
 She worked for Fox News 
 One of her mans that she lent her drop to 
 Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it 
 Says it's important that it looks like an accident 
 She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it 
 She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit 
 Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks 
 Crossed the line from her world of news castin' 
 To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

 [Verse 1] 
 United States in fear 
 London knows I'm a phantom, South Korea knows I'm here 
 Posted, planted without exception 
 Rise to your feet for this rarity 
 Nas and Dilla beat, the fly soliloquy 
 Some real nigga talkin' 
 This don't happen too often, take precaution 
 Liars and frauds got you exhausted 
 You've been accosted 
 Who told you I'd lost it? 
 I just put it down for a second, damn 
 Can the king lounge for a second, kick his hooves up? 
 Grow stubble on the face for once without a smooth cut? 
 Grow a little gut, can't even enjoy the fruit of my labor 
 Before they call me Luke and hand me my lightsaber 
 The ruler's back, you can tell by the trumpets 
 Prince of Wales sent me tea, biscuits, crumpets 
 Jewelry cost more than the car, car cost 200 
 Get out your chair, the season of Nasir

 [Verse 2] 
 Jay Elec doesn't write it 
 HOV couldn't write it, he vacationin' 
 Jungle the only brother I take shit from 
 Hassan give me lines, we talk all the time 
 So I guess if he inspired my song it ain't mine 
 Let me make this clear, they fear the gifted 
 Some say Shakespeare never existed 
 Wow, now, look at the amount of resistance 
 Attempts to chisel my face, from the mountain you guessed it 
 Bitch you guessed it 
 There, did I answer your questions? 
 So, now that's out the way let's get back to my message 
 Now I'm 40 and a little change 
 Ride around, sport a new Benz, a little Range 
 Havin' fun, my little man gettin' big 
 He and my daughter down, when we talk it's real 
 Nothin' is watered down, young boy swag 
 I'm here today as well as the 90's 
 But the past, like my ass, is behind me 
 Ignite the pyrex 
 Try to bite this, get Nasty Nas-itis 
 Arthritis when you try to write this 
 Asking why is the Feds at my niggas? 
 Why the Feds at my niggas? 
 I know by now I should be talkin' bread, crack, and figures 
 But not stressin', knot stressin' 
 I'm survivin', I'm survivin' 
 It's funny when I catch cops textin' and drivin' 
 Who questions and penalizes them? 
 One day we'll have their ass in court and we'll be tryin' them 
 Hey yo, it's love for Detroit, Mo-Town, Motor City 
 Dilla lives on, it's like he wrote it with me 
 The soulful sample complements my rhyme so well 
 Slacks by Zegna, or YSL 
 Matchin' the Saint Laurents, I'm fly as hell 
 Hands in the air, the season of Nasir

 "When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be" 
 "Nas.." 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers 
 Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap 
 As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube 
 Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube 
 Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice 
 Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper 
 Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla 
 Outside was psychoes, killers 
 Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey 
 R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey 
 Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters 
 My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean 
 I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin' 
 Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin' 
 Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily 
 Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me 
 Yo, I'm in my second childhood 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"

 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib 
 Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid 
 Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew 
 They break his moms furniture, watchin' Comicview 
 Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's 
 In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well 
 When his stash slow, he be crazy 
 Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday 
 Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared 
 They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds 
 So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years 
 Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs 
 All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night 
 With young dudes it's them he wanna be like 
 It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up 
 31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be" 
 "N-A-S" - "Nas.."

 "Make everything right.." - "Get yours..." 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Baby girl she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late 
 Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin' 
 E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education 
 Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations 
 Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel 
 With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well 
 Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve 
 He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse 
 No job never stay workin', mad purty 
 Shorty they call her the brain surgeon 
 Time flyin', she the same person 
 Never matures, all her friends married doin' well 
 She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was 12 
 Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights 
 Selfish in her own right for life 
 Guess she's in her second childhood 
  
 [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] 
 "When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be" 
 "N-A-S" - "Nas.."

 [Verse 1] 
 Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes 
 Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate 
 That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah 
 X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade 
 Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball 
 That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because 
 'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto 
 Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil 
 'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats 
 Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row 
 Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros 
 Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova 
 Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes 
 Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes 
 So where them years go? 
 Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go? 
 But now them shorties here though, so 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers 
 In army boots, yellin', "Join the armed forces!" 
 We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons 
 Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes 
 There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices 
 War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us 
 They won't be servin' the beast too long 
 The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn 
 Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose 
 And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose 
 In frozen corners of Chicago 
 Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers 
 We devil incarnates headed for jail 
 Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed 
 Your paper money was the death of Christ 
 And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life 
 It's like a cycle 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up 
 That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products 
 Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin' 
 The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor 
 Just to prove we some creative niggas 
 Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work 
 And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work 
 War is necessary to my niggas in chains 
 From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing 
 The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does 
 Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves 
 Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you 
 Even when all else fail, God support you 
 I done it, got "God's Son" on my stomach 
 My heart and my lungs was affected 
 From Henny's and gettin' blunted 
 Do your body right and it loves you back 
 You only get one life, and yo, because of that 
 I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause 
 Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws 
 And it's like that 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time 
 The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs 
 Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word? 
 The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb 
 And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel 
 Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail? 
 Mind of a shooter, CFO also 
 Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful 
 Money is attractive, honey dress strapless 
 Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic 
 Stroll up in the party: titanium black card 
 Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah 
 'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours 
 You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star 
 These old heads got stories, the days they was kings 
 I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams 
 You 16, you could do 20, come home young 
 Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done 
 What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars 
 Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies 
 A 360 in the streets real grizzly 
 Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning 
 Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with 
 Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders 
 This ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show 
 Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle 
 Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you 
 It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love? 
  
 [Chorus: Cocaine 80s] 
 Love, I'll trade you love 
 I've traded fire with you long enough 
 Is that all you brung, without love? 
 That's fucked up, but I saved your soul 
 Roll that up 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game 
 Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name 
 Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim 
 To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed 
 Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank 
 'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think 
 It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from 
 Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung 
 Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up 
 Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us 
 Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like 
 "Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous" 
 Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble 
 One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle 
 Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us 
 No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up 
 But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual 
 Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral 
 I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you 
 Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to 
 The G is in your genes, already you tuck 
 Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut 
 Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet 
 Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit 
 Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise 
 No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor 
 I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist 
 Corona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you 
 It ain't The Truman show; it's the human show 
 Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle 
 Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you 
 Young brother go and get your paper, I got love 
  
 [Chorus: Cocaine 80s] 
 Love, I'll trade you love 
 I've traded fire with you long enough 
 Is that all you brung, without love? 
 That's fucked up, but I saved your soul 
 Roll that up

 [Intro: Prodigy & (Havoc)] 
 Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (Right out the pack son) 
 For niggas don't know how to act (No doubt son) 
 Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (No doubt son) 
 For niggas don't know how to act 
  
 [Verse 1: Prodigy] 
 Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously 
 Havoc and P, Queens niggas so it seem to be 
 Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise 
 Mega got word back from Noreaga 
 The D.A. got video cassette tape of 
 The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper 
 Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up 
 Pig-tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles 
 I been through, crime shit my niggas into 
 Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too 
 JFK on our way to L.A 
 Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré 
 My crew do it the Mobb way, every day 
 Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me 
 Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli 
 Now undress, you know the drill-y 
 Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats 
 I have yet to met challenger who go against my set 
 Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on 
 Any character approach me 
 I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny 
 While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe 
 Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet 
 You pay about $5,000 a plate 
  
 [Verse 2: Havoc] 
 No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid 
 The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib 
 Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely 
 It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me 
 We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure 
 Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser 
 Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped 
 (Floatin' in the river with your body wrapped in plastic) 
 Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin' 
 QB represent fuck that, it can happen 
 While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in 
 Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin' 
 We think smarter, reach harder 
 Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of 
 If I was you, then I would do what I have to 
 But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you 
 Then stepped off casually, naturally me 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Niggas thinkin' shit sweet, I carry big heat 
 Wavy hair, chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep 
 Queens murder cliques meet, yellow tapes on black gates 
 Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait 
 I escape into zones, that's irregular 
 Why debate on the phone, I'm solar cellular 
 Escobar 600 
 You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it 
 Curriculum of a mathologist 
 Deep throats, they try to swallow this 
 Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists 
 I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone 
 Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life 
 I put my word on it 
 Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it 
 Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Airy lodges 
 We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El DeBarge's 
 Catchin' charges, of marksmen, livin' heartless 
 Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit 
 We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums 
 From Queens cross the Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em 
  
 [Outro: Prodigy & (Havoc)] 
 For niggas don't know how to act 
 To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack 
 Rest in peace to my niggas layin' on they back 
 To all the niggas who bust gat 
 (Live nigga rap) 
 For niggas don't know how to act 
 To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack 
 Rest in peace to my niggas on they back 
 To all the niggas who bust gat 
 (Live nigga rap) 
 For niggas don't know how to act 
 To all the niggas on the block slangin' crack 
 Rest in peace to my niggas on they back 
 To all the niggas who bust gat 
 (If you's a live nigga)[Intro: Nas] 
 I want you to close your eyes 
 And vision the most beautiful place in the world 
 If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner 
 Come on this journey, the best journey 
 A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings 
 To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things 
 Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks 
 Missionaries pass out papers that read "Love God" 
 I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops 
 I watch because every thug's face is my mirror 
 But this was one in particular 
 This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro 
 Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go 
 Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke 
 He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks 
 Dangerous street corners where it sets at 
 Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs 
 Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin' 
 Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin' 
 He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin' 
 I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion 
  
 [Chorus: J. Phoenix] 
 Every corner, every city 
 There's a place where life's a little easy 
 Little Hennessy, laid back and cool 
 Every hour, 'cause it's all good 
 Leave all the stress from the world outside 
 Every wrong done will be alright 
 Nothing but peace, love, and street passion 
 Every ghetto needs a thug mansion 
  
 [Verse 2: 2Pac] 
 Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good 
 Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods 
 Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook 
 Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke 
 Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang 
 Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came 
 Little LaTasha sho' grown 
 Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home 
 Maybe in time you'll understand 
 Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band 
 Just think of all the people that you knew in the past 
 That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last 
 Picture a place that they exist, together 
 There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven 
 So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin' 
 Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion 
  
 [Chorus: J. Phoenix] 
 Every corner, every city 
 There's a place where life's a little easy 
 Little Hennessy, laid back and cool 
 Every hour, 'cause it's all good 
 Leave all the stress from the world outside 
 Every wrong done will be alright 
 Nothing but peace, love, and street passion 
 Every ghetto needs a thug mansion 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide 
 Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by 
 No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets 
 No reason for nobody's momma to cry 
 See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter 
 But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her 
 This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me 
 Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe 
 'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin' 
 I'm just twenty-some-odd years 
 I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy 
 I know she smiles on her boy 
 I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur 
 'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war 
 And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more 
 'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne 
 Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion 
  
 [Chorus: J. Phoenix] 
 Every corner, every city 
 There's a place where life's a little easy 
 Little Hennessy, laid back and cool 
 Every hour, 'cause it's all good 
 Leave all the stress from the world outside 
 Every wrong done will be alright 
 Nothing but peace, love, and street passion 
 Every ghetto needs a thug mansion[Intro] 
 Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley 
 Got blazed before they told stories 
 I'mma get blazed before I tell y'all stories 
 I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died 
 So he had him cremated 
 Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring 
 Now he watches his son shine everyday 
 I just thought about that 
 While I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing 
 Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean 
 Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes 
 Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome 
 But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin' 
 Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close 
 Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy 
 Mommy was bad they say 
 Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swings 
  
 [Hook] 
 As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray 
 I could see my whole life fly past me 
 Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy? 
 And will the money and fame outlast me? 
 The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray 
 Well, I see my whole life fly past me 
 I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy? 
 Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Sam trusted Womack with his main lady 
 He tossing in the grave like, "This is how you repay me?!" 
 A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much 
 Marvin said "No mountain's high enough," fly stuff 
 David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell 
 Gave her concussions 
 While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion 
 When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried 
 Many people said that she was laughin' inside 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery 
 It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals 
 She's what a temptress be 
 The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery! 
 Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington 
 Someone is sabotaging 'em 
 Watch out for the traps 
 Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman 
 Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp 
 And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats 
 This is what came from their pain 
 From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 I could smell old bogey cigars 
 Long record perfumes, smelling just as sweet 
 Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top 
 Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean? 
 Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout 
 Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar 
 For playing Mammy in "Gone with the Wind" 
 And she didn't get allowed 
 Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier 
 Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint 
 Man, you know they were strong back then, man 
 Blunt from my ash tray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah[Intro: Nas] 
 Uhh, Lord, Lord y'all 
 What I'm gon' do? 
 Uhh, *sigh*, Lord, Lord y'all 
 Haha, shit is all true 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Mmm... Fried chicken, fly vixen 
 Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen 
 You a bird but you ain't a ki' 
 Got wings but you can't fly away from me 
 Driving in your bucket seats 
 All the way from Kentucky to fuck with me 
 Look what you done to me, was number one to me 
 After you shower, you and your gold medal flour 
 Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour 
 You in your hot tub I'm looking at you salivating 
 Dry you off I got your paper towel waiting 
 Lay you down cause you're red hot 
 Louisiana style you make my head rot 
 Then I flock to the bed then, plop! 
 When we done I need rest 
 Don't know what part of you I love best 
 Your legs or your breast 
 Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death 
 Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest 
 You gon' be a nigga death 
 Mrs. Fried Chicken you was my addiction 
 Dripping with high cholest- 
 Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his to-mato pasta 
 What roti is to a rasta 
 Trapping me; you and your friend mac' and cheese 
 Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees 
 It's killing me when I'm inside 
 Nothing I need more than a fish fry 
  
 [Verse 2: Busta Rhymes] 
 Shit, it taste good I can't lie 
 It's like you're walking out the tanning salon 
 When I pull you out the oven from baking I got you on my mind 
 Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body 
 So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine 
 Hey, my pretty HamHock 
 It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power 
 To massaging me to shower you with lemon water 
 Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder 
 Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan 
 While enjoying your butter milk treatment 
 I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin 
 Despite the funny fragrance still I lick my finger frequent 
 In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs 
 That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you 
 But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist 
 When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue 
 Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you 
 Or was it infection manifesting 
 Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you 
 Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine 
 I'm a eat you until there's nothing left 
 Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death 
 Despite I prepare it the best and specialize in cooking swine as a chef 
 You gon' be a nigga death 
 Who cares if the swine is mixed with rat, cat and dog combined 
 Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death 
  
 [Outro: Busta Rhymes] 
 Ain't that some shit 
 I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me 
 And I choose to do that, why? 
 'Cause that's just what niggas do, hahahahaha[Produced by Dr. Dre]

 Niggas stealin' beats and niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit, niggas wanna take everything from a nigga man 
 Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man

 All these niggas talkin all this bullshit 
 Better sit back, and watch what happens 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out 
 Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial 
 Fatal not fictitious 
 I rock the cable '86 shit 
 Foreign cars young with crazy bitches 
 Mad smoke makes me able to quote 
 Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote 
 A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand 
 As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand 
 In the heat of the moment 
 Like Farrakhan said we need atonement 
 Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up 
 Calicones lit it up 
 I didn't get touched checking my nuts 
 I stood up and lit a Dutch 
 Clutching gats quick to bust 
 But knowing how these niggas tattle 
 I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle 
 So when you run the lead travel 
 I come through it's taboo 
 Ninety-six ways made to clap you

 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window 
 I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu 
 Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples 
 Substantial amounts you owe to the firm 
 Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing 
 Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano 
 Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles 
 Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro 
 Compared to these niggas who swear to be real 
 But impostors to Hoffa 
 Nas plague kills 
 Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell 
 From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP 
 A hundred G cars 
 Garcia Vegas cigars 
 Kani shit, mad jiggy 
 The clout, murder material serial scratched out 
 My name's passed out like it's something venereal 
 But back in stereo

 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface 
 I bit the fruit from the Serpent 
 Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted 
 Control the rap game you got it twisted 
 Dr. Dre way, the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it 
 Sip Cris' push the six with biscuit 
 Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all 
 Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in 
 My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck 
 Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it 
 Rap hero black DeNiro 
 Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero 
 Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low 
 Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile 
 Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone 
 Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes 
 These three words are sung

 Let's get paid 
 Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here 
 Riffing and beefing about this bullshit 
 Yo while they doing all that

 This Cristal and party to the year 2G

 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, release what's in me 
 Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty 
 Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny 
 Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams 
 I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at 
 It's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed 
 Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze 
 That cop he got a death wish 
 He run behind niggas until you breathless 
 Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit! 
 My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with 
 I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it 
 (Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun) 
 Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum 
 To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar 
 Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater 
 I heard she brag about the way he eat her 
 A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba 
 She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul 
 Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud 
 Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin' 
 Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron 
 I heard she let Jake investigate from her window 
 Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info 
 So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up 
 I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up 
 (Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst 
 They had the chains on, son hit the lock first 
 We busted in the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt 
 I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth 
 We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors 
 They eyein' us, (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five) 
 Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now 
 There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now 
 Two in the dome, he's laid down 
 Ayo the bitch is saved now 
 She's livin' in a snitch grave now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Shootouts is similar to Wild West 
 Broad daylight, face to face without a vest 
 You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles 
 Please God just save the life that the Devil sold 
 See It Was Written but was never told 
 Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold 
 Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit 
 Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Still on the streets with my peeps so deep 
 We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek 
 To do his two to four 
 Niggas show love, from all around the board 
 Peace Lord 
 Sony Handy-Cam on record 
 Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn 
 We can watch the tape play back and just zone 
 Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions 
 We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter 
 Music was loud and it was crowded 
 Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted 
 And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost 
 Guzzled his drink, and staggered off 
 He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill 
 Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel 
 Somethin' in the air yeah 
 Frank returned with Pierre 
 A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year 
 I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend 
 And everyone except for me had started reachin' 
 They had gats in each others faces, with kids 
 And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper 
 My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off 
 Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off 
 Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots 
 Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it 
 Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out 
 Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous 
 Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave 
 Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin' 
 We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died 
 Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Shootouts is similar to Wild West 
 Broad daylight, face to face without a vest 
 You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles 
 Please God just save the life that the Devil sold 
 See It Was Written but was never told 
 Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold 
 Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit 
 Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot[Intro] 
 Uhh, y'know 
 I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin' in my veins 
 It's just hot - until a nigga can't take it no more 
 Blood of a slave, heart of a King - turn my voice up 
  
 [Verse] 
 Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic 
 I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt 
 They thought I'd make another Illmatic 
 But it's always forward I'm movin' 
 Never backwards stupid here's another classic 
 C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll 
 They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced directed by 
 The Kid slash Escobar; narration describes 
 The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive 
 The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched 
 Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down 
 While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background 
 Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns 
 Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor 
 I learned the difference 'tween the snitches 
 The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews 
 People jumpin' from roofs 
 Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth 
 Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine 
 That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth 
 I know the streets thirst water like Moses 
 Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free 
 This is my ending and my new beginning - nostalgia 
 Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix 
 I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute 
 Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all 
 Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back 
 Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo man 
 To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real 
 Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils 
 Let my words guide you, get inside you 
 From Crip to Pirus, this is survival 
  
 [Outro] 
 Blood of a slave, heart of a King 
 Blood of a slave, heart of a King 
 Uhh, uhh, blood of a slave, heart of a King 
 Uhh, yeah

 Leave it to y'all, these niggas left for dead 
 Last week my man swore he saw Special Ed 
 Rap is like a ghost town, real mystic 
 Like these folks never existed 
 They the reason that rap became addictive 
 Play they CD or wax and get lifted 
 I recommend when your kid turn ten 
 Let him hear Spice 1, made plenty noise 
 Positive K, Father MC, the Skinny Boys

 [Chorus] 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses 
 Had to bring it back to New York 
 I'm happy that the streets is back in New York 
 For you rappers, I carry the cross 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses 
 Had to bring it back to New York 
 I'm happy that the streets is back in New York 
 For you rappers, I carry the cross 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers 
 There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to 
 I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated 
 But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited 
 NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society 
 Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me 
 I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em 
 To which doctor you copped 
 And you locked and it ain't what it was 
 I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B 
 Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly 
 'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me 
 Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me 
 What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be 
 The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see 
 Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin' 
 I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life 
 And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck 
 A six, a truck, some guns to bust 
 I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass 
 With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses 
 Had to bring it back to New York 
 I'm happy that the streets is back in New York 
 For you rappers, I carry the cross 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses 
 Had to bring it back to New York 
 I'm happy that the streets is back in New York 
 For you rappers, I carry the cross 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des 
 I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex 
 I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes 
 Water and flowers in 'em 
 While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin' 
 Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters 
 .40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight 
 You too light? I shoot your freckles out 
 You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about 
 Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses 
 Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy 
 We can sell mo' boats on the coast 
 Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low 
 But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky 
 You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three 
 Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil 
 Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on 
 'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on 
 From here on it's a new day 
 Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday 
 Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake 
 Hope y'all relate 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses 
 Had to bring it back to New York 
 I'm happy that the streets is back in New York

 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion

 [Verse 1: Quan] 
 Can we please have a moment of silence 
 That's for my niggas doing years in confinement 
 And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living 
 That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em 
 Can we please pour out some liquor 
 Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that 
 Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here 
 And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here 
 This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain 
 Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine 
 Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by 
 To live it alive, so instead they live it to die 
 Can we please have a moment of peace 
 For every G that fell for his flag in the streets 
 Blooding and thugging, folking and loking 
 Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging 
 Or just for poor righteous teaching 
  
 [Hook: Quan] 
 As day comes and night falls 
 For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all 
 And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn 
 While wishing y'all were home 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yeah and can we have another moment of silence 
 For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence 
 From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds 
 To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying 
 And can we please pour some more liquors 
 For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas 
 Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan 
 It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on 
 Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets 
 And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest 
 And can we please have a moment of truth 
 For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots 
 And families back home who pray they make it home safe 
 Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles 
 This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you 
 Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you 
 Let's take 'em home 
  
 [Hook x2: Quan] 
 As day comes and night falls 
 For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all 
 And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn 
 While wishing y'all were home 
  
 [Verse 3: Quan] 
 And can we please have a moment to mourn 
 For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on 
 Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah 
 Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya 
 Can we please have a moment for children 
 Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system 
 Who never knew their father, never learned to dream 
 But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends 
 For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad 
 Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had 
 For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed 
 So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime 
 For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding 
 Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking 
 Just a moment outside the day to day struggle 
 To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

 [45 seconds of talking/skit] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It was a murder 
 Jake just hit the corner people swarming 
 Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "Fuck 
 Niggas is buck," mega bloodshed, the tape's red 
 I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked" 
 I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high 
 It's late I'm looking down at the fella 
 Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion 
 His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk 
 It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder 
 That the street's designed to stop your life clock 
 The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail 
 First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail 
 Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell 
 My niggas never snitch why tell 
 We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities 
 Queens'll be the death of me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 To the suspect witness: don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight 
 (Suspect witness don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight) 
 Suspect witness: don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight 
 (Suspect witness don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested 
 Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness 
 My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence 
 Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter 
 Nautica Down, frames look petite 
 Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique 
 I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely 
 My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly 
 Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese 
 Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese 
 I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of 
 Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards 
 Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive 
 A Million Man March, alert the masses 
 Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses 
 Don assassins, Armageddon 
 The wedding of a freak and a beast 
 Seven heads, got the righteous threatened 
 Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin' 
 Comprehend the grammar, Math we own 
 Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known? 
 I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic 
 The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is 
 What you with? Luchi or drama 
 No sleep means insomnia 
 No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Suspect witness: don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight 
 (Suspect niggas don't come outside 
 You might get your shit pushed back tonight) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized 
 Mega live, like the third world 
 Decipher my deceiver make him a believer 
 Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver 
 Bond is my life so I live by my word 
 Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs 
 Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin' 
 Rebel to America civilization, caught you sleepin'

 [Havoc] 
 Nine-six, Escobar 600 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas (Havoc)] 
 Check the shit 
 My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really 
 They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly 
 Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it 
 I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it 
 Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in their coke 
 And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY'RE BROKE 
 While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin' 
 Seen the ill Beamers beamin' 
 Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin' 
 To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa 
 "Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster 
 Meet me in the Bridge, I'm bout to go loca" 
 Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her 
 He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious 
 With two MACs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober 
 I need some Henn to bend me over, my nigga Hav gotta soldier 
 It's gettin' down, it's goin' down kid (I got this, I got this) 
 I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears 
 Told these broads to put it in gear 
 With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo 
 What up son? These niggas done started somethin' wild 
 You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill 
 Tried to get a name, holding the steel 
 I paid attention to the females 
 Maintained bitches when it get real 
 Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal 
 He said both hoes'll peel 
 Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel 
 Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill 
 I laid back, Escobar status 
 Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it, shit we was born with 
  
 [Chorus: Havoc] 
 Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die 
 In this, business of trifeness 
 I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit 
 Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit' 
 Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift 
 Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up 
 Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die 
 In this, business of trifeness 
 We finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit 
 Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit' 
 Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift 
 Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Hold it right there, pull over 
 That nigga right there inside the Rover 
 I knew he'd be right here, I told you 
 Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova 
 Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders 
 He's stuntin', after he left my man like that 
 Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back 
 He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus 
 And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business 
 And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him 
 Do what ya gotta do to get to him 
 A tight Parasuco with young faces 
 Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages 
 They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked 
 Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York 
 If they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?" 
 He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him "Don't grab, boo" 
 They started chattin', was only bout a minute, flat when 
 They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin' 
 We followed them pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian 
 Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn 
 I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them 
 We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow 
 We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'? 
 Sosa said "Say no more", we started rollin' 
 Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin' 
 There the girls go, hurry up we out 
 In the 940, me, Sosa and two shorties 
 The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy 
  
 [Chorus: Havoc] 
 Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die 
 In this, business of trifeness

 Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

 Now tell me what y'all smokin' 
 What kinda heat y'all holdin' 
 Well is your creep move potent? 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
 We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin' 
 We got the plan in motion 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Zoom, from outer space he comes 
 Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun 
 Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys 
 Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized 
 What is his race, nation, or creed? 
 Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian they read 
 Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens 
 Spit at judges, stepped on peasants 
 But in reality, I just entered your galaxy 
 September '73, up in these wild streets 
 Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn) 
 And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now tell me what y'all smokin' 
 What kinda heat y'all holdin' 
 Well is your creep move potent? 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
 We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin' 
 We got the plan in motion 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My nigga smoke with one lung 
 If he cough he might die, passin' me trees 
 The liquor bottle's almost empty 
 We about to collide, with the enemy 
 Only way you die if it's meant to be 
 You fuckin' with a general 
 No discussion is the principle we bust and it's the end of you 
 Now we knockin' on your mama door 
 Like we came to fix the sink; my kind of war 
 Death, angels coming for you 
 Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2 
 Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win? 
 The hands of time, or the hands of medicine 
 Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake 
 Walk by your casket, spit in your face 
 Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide 
 And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now tell me what y'all smokin' 
 What kinda heat y'all holdin' 
 Well is your creep move potent? 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
 We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin' 
 We got the plan in motion 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Pardon but I gotta question of life now 
 Look at the nigga next to you right now 
 Is he real, fake or scared? 
 Do it like this niggas right hands in the air 
 Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart 
 Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start 
 "I shall - stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures 
 Never put a bitch over my niggas 
 I shall never, cooperate with the law 
 Never snake me I always hold you down in war 
 If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs 
 I never break the oath to the death I swear" 
 I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance 
 Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science 
 Of a nigga still yet to be found 
 So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now tell me what y'all smokin' 
 What kinda heat y'all holdin' 
 Well is your creep move potent? 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
 We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin' 
 We got the plan in motion 
 I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns 
 I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon 
  
 [Outro] 
 Wanna get high, come smoke with me 
 Smoke with me, light it up 
  
 [During outro] 
 Damn, nigga, take this weed, I'm 'bout to go over to my bitch house, get my fuck on, nigga! Y'all niggas stay up!

 Come here, bitch, come smoke with a nigga...[Intro: Nas & AZ] 
 Yeah 
 Peace king 
 Peace king 
 Listen, if they wrote a book on your life 
 Right 
 You think anybody'll read it? 
 No fuckin' doubt! 
 Let's make history homie 
 Aight then 
 You know we brought the hoes, clothes and money rolls to the table 
 {*laughing*} No, fuckin', doubt 
 It's time to manifest this 
 Tuu, we the flyest nigga 
 Bring it to a whole, y'know? 
 Gangsta nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Shelene Thomas] 
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow 
 Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes 
 Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome 
 We the flyest gangsters 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo 
 Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow 
 Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy 
 The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me 
 Homicide can't scare me 
 I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga 
 The type that can build with ya 
 Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given 
 Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty 
 Truly my only duty is to dodge prison 
 Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me 
 Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy 
 Dough forever, the live stay low forever 
 And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together 
 One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant 
 No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance 
  
 [Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)] 
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow 
 Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes) 
 Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha) 
 We the flyest gangsters 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I do what I can do when I can do it 
 Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin' 
 Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it 
 Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it 
 Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside 
 I'll never catch a vehicular homicide 
 My music is a description of my vibe of course 
 My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork 
 'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can 
 You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands 
 To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home 
 Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it 
 I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord 
 Wonderin' does Faith, think about Big anymore 
 Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin' 
 We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous 
 I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother 
 Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover 
 Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em 
 I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest 
  
 [Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)] 
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow (uhh) 
 Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes) 
 Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha) 
 We the flyest gangsters 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas, AZ & Both​​​] 
 We put this on the, soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an 
 Kamikaze style 
 Older cats coaching us on 
 Yo, it's kill or be killed 
 Understand, real'll be real 
 A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel 
 Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield 
 And fuck a drop, 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed 
 Close the book 
 Was taught never expose a crook 
 Between the knight and the bishop 
 One'll knock ya rook 
 I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead 
 I ain't like niggas with sight, too impaired to read 
 We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target? 
 Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers 
  
 [Chorus: Shelene Thomas] 
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow 
 Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes 
 Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome 
 We the flyest gangsters 
  
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow 
 Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes 
 Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome 
 We the flyest gangsters[Intro] 
 Uhh, uhh 
 Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 No idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun 
 It's never what you do, but how it's done 
 What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper 
 That means you inferior, not major 
 No idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun 
 It's never what you do, but how it's done 
 What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper 
 That means you inferior, not major 
  
 [Verse] 
 If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find 
 Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes 
 Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard 
 Where weed's responsible for memory loss 
 Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous 
 See what I seen every day I live with this torture 
 Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours 
 Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower 
 My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons 
 Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em 
 The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl 
 Everybody had money, every summer was real ill 
 Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane 
 No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned 
 Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin' 
 Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children 
 And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto 
 Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o 
 We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference 
 On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight 
 You're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs 
 While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things 
 But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties 
 Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story 
 From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis 
 Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias 
 Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars 
 Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught 
 Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style 
 While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul 
 Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child 
 But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out 
 The chain be like a hundred K 
 Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute 
 Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God 
 It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas 
 My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind 
 Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams 
 Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change 
 Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things 
 Like, somebody's always watchin' 
 My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option 
 Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns 
 Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one 
 I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled 
 Headline readin' "Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'"[Chorus] 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless 
 Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this 
 Showed me how exciting life is 
 I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks 
 The sheistiest, put you on they heist list 
 How we met it must have been fate 
 First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak 
 She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid 
 How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid 
 She said she want to have a family raise kids someday 
 Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day 
 I can get with that I drop you off home 
 I call you hit me back 
 I wanna dig that and did I? I did that 
 Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had 
 You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats 
 You precious, more precious than lost treasure 
 Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil 
 Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice 
 And it's the day that your father give you away 
 To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand 
 Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to 
 Now, look me in my eyes and say I do 
 Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates 
 We can spend our honeymoon in the States 
 You can throw your friend the bouquet 
 Something in the back of my head say 
 For us two, maybe cause I love you 
 Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you 
 As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you 
 Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful 
 Deeper and harder love laying new with you 
 Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by 
 While I'm with you and I won't even care, word 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's 
 Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas 
 Thug ones to those soft as baby shit 
 She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips 
 'Til one day she decided to flip 
 It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit 
 Started talking this divorcing shit 
 I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake 
 Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that 
 Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that 
 Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that 
 All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass 
 Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look 
 With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook 
 For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too 
 You my queen, God bless you 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G 
 Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G[Produced by Salaam Remi] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens 
 I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment 
 Proletarian chicks sparking 
 Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon 
 Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and 
 Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling 
 Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging 
 Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album 
 Thinking I should leave to a European island 
 Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin 
 Dinner serenaded with a violin 
 But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing 
 Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit 
 Fine dining Olive Garden 
 Nah bitch, Nas is In the real deal 
 Food spots on the constant 
 Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it 
 Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches 
 Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping 
 Ask her has she been around duffle bags 
 Full of that fuck you cash 
 Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass 
 Looking in my eyes saying "Nas, you're one lucky bastard" 
 Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger 
 I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter 
 See us in the coupe flying passed ya 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Esco, dress code, it changes 
 Harrods in England 
 Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging 
 Counting wonder in the Tundra 
 Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya 
 Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die 
 But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie 
 When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates 
 To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict 
 Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out 
 You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut 
 Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up 
 Who don't speak, she quiet 
 So I can think, conspire 
 On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers 
 Wear ties at the Setai Miami 
 Time-pieces are from Zurich 
 It’s like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9 
 Give it to you raw so you can feel it[Chorus] 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us 
 We were scholars long before colleges 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, but still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, we are the slave and the master 
 What you looking for? You the question and the answer 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us 
 Powdered eggs and government cheeses 
 The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus 
 Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers 
 Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten 
 Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant 
 Yeah I'm from the ghetto 
 Where old black women talk about their sugar level 
 It's not unusual 
 To see photos of dead homies funerals 
 Aluminum foil on TV antennas 
 Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners 
 Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid 
 They gave us lemons, we made lemonade 
 But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves 
 Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling 
 Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us 
 We were scholars long before colleges 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, but still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, we are the slave and the master 
 What you looking for? You the question and the answer 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga? 
 No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers 
 My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases 
 That should mean the court could see my changes 
 Take off the bracelets 
 Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex 
 My chest still cut up like a bag of dope 
 Thought patterns consist of boss matters 
 Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth 
 Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must 
 Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs 
 But this is what I was dreaming of 
 Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up 
 They used to string us up, we wanted everything 
 But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the 
 Like the New Jack City wedding scene 
 No time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us 
 We were scholars long before colleges 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, but still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, we are the slave and the master 
 What you looking for? You the question and the answer 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My nig', what up my nig'? Yep! 
 People afraid of criticism 
 But I always put myself in a sacrificial position 
 They been know I ain't just rapping for fame 
 I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains 
 Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter 
 They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war 
 They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more 
 So now my enemies are at my front door 
 'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence 
 They calling it reverse racism 
 Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung' 
 I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me 
 You'll always know where to find me 
 They say the close ones will hurt you 
 So let's keep a small circle 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us 
 We were scholars long before colleges 
 They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are 
 Much more, but still we choose to ignore 
 The obvious, we are the slave and the master 
 What you looking for? You the question and the answer[Intro: Kenny Loggins sample] 
 Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why? 
  
 [Break] 
 To my dogs.. wherever you are 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid 
 You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid 
 Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit 
 We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest 
 For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out 
 Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts 
 You came to my hood, we was broke 
 I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke? 
 Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so 
 'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto 
 But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones 
 Peace to your daughter and your newborn son 
 It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response 
 But, now competition is none, now that you're gone 
 And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain 
 And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that 
 It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you 
 Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official 
 Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're 
 Capable to take it where you took it to 
 I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake 
 'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way 
 I woulda stayed so long with so much to say 
 I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin' 
 Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side 
 But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by 
 You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die 
 You was like God to us in the form of Allah 
  
 [Kenny Loggins sample] 
 Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (Thug Life never die..) 
 Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop 
 And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor 
 You was more than just the wildest nigga 
 2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga 
 It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone 
 On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on 
 The industry be talkin', offendin' me often 
 They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin 
 I can relate, shootouts and court dates 
 All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space 
 You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up? 
 How long would I ride before I fold up? 
 How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go? 
 You predicted it in every line, all in your flow 
 There could Never Be Peace I have to quote 
 Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote" 
 We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top 
 But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped 
 In NYC, at MTV, people watched 
 We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep 
 Think about how us real niggas would be 
 If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it? 
 You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified 
 Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied 
 And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct? 
 But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link 
 Will there ever be another MC as nice? 
 Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ? 
  
 [Kenny Loggins sample] 
 Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour? 
 Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war? 
 What has Al Green seen, that made him religious? 
 Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business? 
 If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down 
 A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around 
 'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream 
 I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens 
 It be the ones you always knew, that want it on 
 Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on 
 Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty 
 Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money 
 I thought I made it but we only took baby steps 
 Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks 
 To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless" 
 That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess 
 We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good 
 Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would 
 A lot of ups and downs in the game 
 Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain 
 One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out 
 Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots 
 And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves 
 While others have no cares and stay in jail 
 More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest 
 Through the head, through the gut it shows 
 The future for us young shooters and old killers 
 Who become rich as dope dealers? 
 Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments 
 Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap 
 We want the fast way out of this trap 
 Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack 
 To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back 
 But life is a dream and y'all taught me that 
  
 [Kenny Loggins sample] 
 .. always survive.. but why? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Always survive, always 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my people just stay alive 
 Still, we, will survive (no matter what) 
 Still, we, will survive (no matter what) 
 Still, we, will survive 
 No matter what, my niggas just stay alive[Produced by Will.I.Am] 
  
 [Nas] 
 There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back 
 Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps 
 Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one 
 Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden 
 So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib 
 Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did 
 All the money and fame, 8 by 10's 
 Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame 
 Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop 
 All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot 
 Wow, I need a moment y'all 
 See I almost felt a tear drop 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When was the last time you heard a real anthem 
 Nas, the millionaire, the mansion 
 When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme 
 Never on schedule, but always on time 
  
 [Hook] 
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me 
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me 
  
 Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block 
 I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot 
 I'm that kid by the number spot 
 That's my past that made me hot 
 Here's my life long anthem 
 Can't forget about you 
 (Can't forget about, Can't forget about you) 
  
 [Nas] 
 Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash 
 Rocksteady spinnin on they back 
 Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince 
 Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since 
 So irregular, how it messed you up 
 When Mr. T became a wrestler 
 Can't forget about Jordan's retirement 
 The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid 
 Some things are forever, some things are not 
 It's the things we remember that gave the world shock 
 They stay in a place in your mind so snug 
 Like who the person was with whom you first made love 
  
 [Hook] 
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me 
  
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me 
  
 Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block 
 I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot 
 I'm that kid by the number spot 
 That's my past that made me hot 
 Here's my life long anthem 
 Can't forget about you 
 (Can't forget about, Can't forget about you) 
 Can't forget about you 
 (Can't forget about, Can't forget about you) 
  
 [Nas] 
 Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now 
 Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired 
 It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died 
 That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired 
 Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines 
 And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times 
 But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind 
 The past the past enough of it, aight then 
 But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson 
 Or Mike when his talk was live 
 Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When was the last time you heard a real anthem 
 Nas, the millionaire, the mansion 
 When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme 
 Never on schedule, but always on time 
  
 [Hook] 
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me 
  
 These streets hold my deepest days 
 This hood taught me golden ways 
 Made me, truly this is what made me 
 Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

 That's why, darling, it's incredible 
 That someone so unforgettable 
 Thinks that I am unforgettable too[Intro: Nas] 
 Yo, this remix goes out to everybody out there 
 That call theyself "keepin' it real" 
 From yours truly, Escobar and Big R 
 From New York to Chi-Town

 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile 
 Give the crew pounds every time we cover new ground 
 Still survivin' but there's a few down, back in the essence 
 I'm askin' questions on the phone with jail adolescents 
 Quiet confession, the system's applyin' the pressure 
 My mind is guessin', is livin' and dyin' a lesson? 
 But not to be obliged with the mirage of cars 
 Take me off track from what the Gods focus on hard 
 Laid up, smokin' cigars, motionin' maids 
 To bring me toast and eggs kosher 
 Ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya 
 My wisdom culture lives in ultra madness 
 Devoted Coach bag bitch 
 Broke, the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich 
 But what's the purpose? 
 Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist 
 I'm physically trapped down on the surface 
 With all the crack merchants, snakes and serpents 
 Foul jakes that search us 
 Clowns with four pounds, this ain't a circus 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly] 
 Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me) 
 Ain't nothin' out there for ya 
 (There ain't nothin' out there for you) 
 Situations gettin' heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs 
 Late night under the Moon as they assume I'm slangin' drugs 
 'Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough 
 Pushed my luck, yo, they had a brother put in cuffs 
 Luckily, made it out of court comfortably 
 Judge said I need a job, ain't nothin' comin' free 
 Could've got a one to three 
 I try to school these shorties under me 
 But they can't see, from life to death 
 So now we back to where we never left 
 The ghetto – it's a damn shame, knowin' it's a man's game 
 Shorty thinks it's time to make your plans change 
 All that runnin' round tryin' to chase what's already here 
 Been there, it's goin' nowhere 
 Pops told me knuckle up, no fear 
 I wish some of these killings they could be prevented 
 Whatever happens, it was written, meaning God meant it 
 But during life, you put your heart in it 
 Even though it seems we bein' targeted 
 Let that brother R hit it 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly] 
 Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me) 
 Ain't nothin' out there for ya 
 (There ain't nothin' out there for you) 
 Situations gettin' heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta 
  
 [Bridge: R. Kelly] 
 Dream on, dream on 
 Dream on, dream on 
 Dream on, dream on 
 Dream on, dream on 
 Street dreamer, yeah 
 Street dreamer, dream on 
 Dream on 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas (R. Kelly)] 
 Sort of wild; since a child, hope was all we had 
 Dreamt of plushed-out pads 
 Complainin', the mental strainin' 
 How many in my crew was into gainin'? 
 Subtract the weak links up out the chain and 
 Rise and start reignin' 
 Blasphemy usin' Nas' name in vain 
 Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name 
 I tried to learn the game and only thing I found incredible 
 Everything I tried to learn, see, I already knew (that's right) 
 And it's embedded in my heart now 
 So I could sit back, count a stack, and play my part now 
 I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise 
 Put a gun to me, hungry, he went on to chastise 
 "That's Nas, ain't it? Made it rich from entertainment" 
 Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with 
 My first thought was: "How the game flip?" 
 Yo, perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on 'gac 
 Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act 
 I did a while back or even beyond that 
 He got me layin' face flat, sayin' my grace, Black 
 Woke up in a cold sweat, yo, I hate that 
 Nightmares feelin' real, word to Will 
 My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield 
 That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal 
 Grab your shield and meet your maker 
 The Queens niggas die for paper 
 Deed the things, the street dreams will take ya 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly] 
 Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me) 
 Ain't nothin' out there for ya 
 (There ain't nothin' out there for you) 
 Situations gettin' heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta 
 Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me) 
 Ain't nothin' out there for ya 
 (There ain't nothin' out there for you) 
 Situations gettin' heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta 
 Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me) 
 Ain't nothin' out there for ya 
 (There ain't nothin' out there for you) 
 Situations gettin' heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta[Intro: Nas] 
 Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real 
 Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty 
 Shorty, what up, huh? 
 Come on 
  
 [Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)] 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice (uh, uh) 
 Now let's say you owe me something 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax 
 Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks 
 Pay me back when you shake it like that girl) 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice (uh, uh) 
 Now let's say you owe, owe, owe 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent 
 Owe me back like its money I spent 
 Pay me back when you shake it again) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 The don, all the time, with all the shine 
 You small time, I ball with mine 
 Links, minks, Bentley Azure with mine 
 My jams bump out to the borderline 
 UK hot with it, blew spots with it 
 Every continent love when I spit it 
 Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it 
 Brothers on lockdown on their cot feel it 
 It's real in the field, the Last Mohican 
 Who survived in the streets and did something decent 
 Now I got plans to buy the whole hood 
 Legit now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge 
 I make hits now, money I flip now 
 Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now 
 I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now 
 So girls everywhere, this is how we get down 
  
 [Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)] 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice 
 Now let's say you owe me something 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax 
 Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks 
 Pay me back when you shake it like that girl) 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice (yeah) 
 Now let's say you owe, owe, owe 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent 
 Owe me back like its money I spent 
 Pay me back when you shake it again) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Play to win, girls in the club moving 
 I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em 
 I flow, I'm so mysterious 
 Nas, and Nasty's the alias 
 Everything platinum I glow 
 Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do' 
 On top out the car, lounge at the bar 
 We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are 
 Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla 
 To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas 
 Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers 
 Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper 
 Look good enough to be taken shopping 
 Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking 
 Your body's so nice that I give you this option 
 Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping 
  
 [Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)] 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice (yeah) 
 Now let's say you owe me something 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax 
 Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks 
 Pay me back when you shake it like that girl) 
 Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice 
 Now let's say you owe, owe, owe 
 (Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent 
 Owe me back like its money I spent 
 Pay me back when you shake it again) 
  
 [Bridge: Ginuwine] 
 I put the shackles on your feet (you owe me) 
 I think you owe me some (you owe me) 
 The shackles on your feet (you owe Nas) 
 I think you owe me some (you owe Ginuwine) 
 (You owe Timbaland, you owe me) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me 
 Mack like Goldie, it's the same story 
 Let you hold something, you spending it right 
 Know where you gon' be by the end of the night 
 Make it bounce, shake it, move it around 
 Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south 
 Fantasizing me inside and you riding 
 Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion 
  
 [Outro: Ginuwine] 
 Shorty, say what's your price 
 (Say what's your price, baby) 
 Just to back it up 
 You can hold my ice 
 Now let's say you owe me something (oh) 
 (You owe me something, oh yeah) 
 I said shorty, say what's your price 
 (You owe Nas) 
 Just to back it up 
 (You owe Ginuwine) 
 You can hold my ice 
 (You owe Timbaland) 
 Now let's say you owe, owe, owe, owe, owe, owe 
 You owe us something, baby 
 Oh, oh, oh[Intro: Nas] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo 
 Life, they wonder, can they take me under? 
 Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I come from the housing tenement buildings 
 Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death 
 Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell 
 Though I owe to it my success 
 With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal' 
 I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud 
 Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign 
 Like, the darker you are the realer your problems 
 I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping 
 On this life mission, never know what's next 
 Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar 
 Had a piece of the globe, every continent 
 Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan 
 Pakistan, America, Afghanstan 
 Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics 
 Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages 
 No war, we should take time and think 
 The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct 
 But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting 
 Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then 
 Must it go on? we must stop the killing 
 Tell me why we die, we all God's children 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Amerie] 
 All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon) 
 It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world) 
 Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon) 
 World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it 
 That's they corner, from New York to California 
 Got blocks locked down 
 Like, "dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town" 
 So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison 
 At an early age, already know it's against him 
 So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes 
 To the set backs and rise 
 Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity 
 Look at what this country's got 
 There shouldn't be nobody homeless 
 How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet 
 The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone 
 To all colors and creeds, to home it belongs 
 I want land, mansions, banks and gold 
 The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control 
 The world's natural resources, all its residuals 
 But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles 
 And I become the most wanted 
 But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service? 
 I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels 
 So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Amerie] 
 All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon) 
 It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world) 
 Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon) 
 World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time 
 No other compares to what Nas write down 
 Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours 
 You could get what you love, be a chain in cause 
 You alive right now 
 There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now 
 It's whatever man think of manifest to the real 
 The plan is to wake up cause time reveals 
 All this hate can't forever last 
 All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed 
 You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again 
 Hoping I reach the world leaders and win 
 Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical 
 We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical 
 In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical 
 To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual 
 Top of the world for the kid, none less 
 Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest 
 I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me 
 You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power 
 To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now 
  
 [Chorus: Nas and Amerie] 
 All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon) 
 It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world) 
 Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon) 
 World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world 
  
 [Outro: Skit] 
 Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying? 
 Niggas ain't forget nothing 
 Men, women and children killed by the police and shit 
 Niggas ain't gon' forget that man, you know what I mean? 
 Yo, what this war just show me is like 
 Whatever you want out of life 
 Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it 
 Even if that means blood and death 
 You know, that's what I was raised up on 
 That's what this country's about 
 This is, this is what my country is, and my country's a motherfucker[Intro] 
 Hope y'all make it through the storm 
 You know what though, I love the rain man 
 A lot of you cats are runnin' your mouths (hahaha) 
 Your runnin' your mouths crazy 
 Think y'all got to ease up though, you know 
 Ease up 'fore somethin' happen man 
 We don't want that, at least you don't 
 Be easy man, tell you how it feels to be on top of the world 
 But y'all niggas better take it slow 
 Don't body ya self 
 Don't body ya self 
 Yeah, don't body ya self nigga 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Everybody get low niggas 
 Dedicated to the fuck Nas coalition 
 Touch my dough, I'm lettin' .40 cals blow, nigga 
 Not cows with four legs 
 But cals with more lead 
 That add up more dead 
 It's on nigga, I'ma bury 'em 
 Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian 
 Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarean (woo!) 
 I push ya grown ass back in your mother's womb 
 You need 9 more months 
 Your crews 9 more punks 
 You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up 
 If I sign y'all I'm on dust 
 Yeah we from the same hood but nigga WHAT?! 
 When y'all was tryna rap y'all was makin' me proud 
 Man now you fucked up down on your luck, runnin' your mouth man 
 Why don't be a real man, say you need a little help 
 And I might help your ass off the shelf 
 But no, you're bein' disrespectful 
 Thinkin' son so cool that he won't check you 
 Stand down, the king is home 
 Queens' own, NASDAQ, Dow Jones 
  
 [Break] 
 Don't body ya self 
 Crazy 
 Take it slow man 
 Slow down (yeah) 
 Take it slow motherfucker 
 Don't body ya self 
 Let's listen 
 Let's just listen 
 Don't body ya self 
 Listen 
 Slow down though man 
 Slow down 
 Y'all gotta take it slow 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and The Fockers 
 With Martin Scorsese after Gangs of New York could rock this 
 Back together with the master plan 
 The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man 
 I'm in the streets like old graffiti 
 I'm hearin' wankstas talkin' greasy 
 Whether broke or rich my friend 
 Nasir bring that career to an end 
 And I'm bored with you MCs B 
 Y'all beneath me 
 And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouija 
 Of course I'm the king, get my shine on 
 And I blind y'all 'cause they call me The Lord of the Rings 
 Pinky heavy man, big stones in the wedding ban' 
 Smell of brimstone back from Hell again 
 Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil sent 
  
 [Break] 
 Y'all need to take it slow 
 Don't body ya self 
 Motherfucker act like ya know ('05) 
 Motherfucker better take it slow 
 Don't body ya self 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 They say Jada defeated him 
 Joe too street for him 
 What's next? I guess it's for Nas to Ether him 
 Y'all awaiting an MC burial 
 This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio 
 What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual 
 Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world 
 Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law 
 Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord 
 And you are none of the above 
 So you a sucka for death, if I'm a sucka for love 
 And y'all wanna know why I don't gotta answer niggas 
 'Cause I truly understand these niggas 
 Scared of me so they talk about family members 
 Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas 
 Damn you was my man like crew, dog 
 Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog 
 The Q is the borough of true Dons 
 Any disrespect nigga we choose arms 
 Will it be Gilmore or Crowe's? 
 Nigga act like ya know 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah 
 Y'all better take it slow 
 Motherfucker act like ya know 
 Mess around and body ya self man 
 Don't body ya self[Produced by L.E.S] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Uh, 2000 G 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back 
 You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that 
 You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat 
 'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em 
 Century 21 solar eclipse 
 While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc 
 Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet 
 AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet 
 QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps 
 Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto 
 Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles 
 Pop bottles with those who left here 
 The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years 
 The aim for the head and chest years 
 What's your name? Make your name known 
 For the next year's, better rep, yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits 
 Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is 
 I was the first one on that Don shit 
 First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit 
 Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips 
 Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch 
 Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell 
 Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels 
 Hood rats and bullet wound up females 
 Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail 
 Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips 
 Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit 
 A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills 
 Our honies wearing Gucci high heels 
 She come to scoop me, I chill 
 Leave the streets alone for a sec 
 Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech 
 Uh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone 
 Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne 
 And we gon' rep it the best that we can 
 Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man 
 But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now 
 Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend 
 And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven 
 But that's another level, brethren 
 Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's 
 We do squeeze, thought it's not right 
 But that's the zone that we left in 
 Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches 
 Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless 
 Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes 
 And we all roll dice, for each other's ice 
 And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys? 
 But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus 
 Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar 
 Now he is Nastradamus

 Wiz, horse 
 L-E-S, L-E-S[Verse 1] 
 Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow? 
 All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes? 
 And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media? 
 They make the world look crazy to keep you inside? 
 Why you listen when the teachers at school 
 Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool 
 Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes 
 Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it? 
 Underground in they casket, ancestors turning 
 I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus 
 Words like God is Greek or Latin 
 So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters 
 My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing 
 Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen 
 What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes 
 Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan 
 What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask 
 For reparations, then they hit us with tax 
 And insurance if we live to be old, what about now? 
 So stop being controlled, we black zombies 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars 
 We've already gone insane 
 We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs 
 Stab our own backs and dream too much 
 Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and 
 Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them 
 Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em 
 On our own people and, fuck black leaders 
 'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic 
 Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet 
 Let's all get down and get up 
 Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck 
 Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church 
 Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first 
 We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated 
 Just to make another generation - black zombies 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance 
 Feel free, hear the music and dance 
 If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you 
 Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews 
 Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim 
 Islam's a beautiful thing 
 And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring 
 Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly 
 So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow? 
 Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow 
 {*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast 
 I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid 
 Control your own destiny, you are a genius 
 Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
 Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies) 
 We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies) 
  
 [Outro:] 
 Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years 
 Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness? 
 Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it 
 When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it 
 Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...[Audio sample] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The sly Fox, cyclops, we locked in an idiot box 
 The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots 
 They own YouTube, MySpace 
 When this ignorant shit going to stop? 
 They monopolizing news, your views 
 And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer 
 The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial 
 Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender 
 Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder 
 Slave culture, game's over 
 What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation 
 Pimp the station, over-stimulation 
 Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan 
 The fox has a bushy tail 
 And Bush tells lies and fox-trots 
 So, I don't know what's real (what's real) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins 
 Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box 
 And unplug from the Matrix doctrine 
 But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching 
 Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins 
 Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box 
 And unplug from the Matrix doctrine 
 But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The Fear Factor got you all riled up 
 O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up 
 Network for child predators, setting them up 
 MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts 
 Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us 
 And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us 
 What is their net worth? 
 They're going to try to censor my next verse 
 Throw them off the roof neck first 
 While I'm clicking my cursor 
 Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal 
 It gets worse 
 While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house 
 They figured us out, why a nigga go south? 
 It's either he caught a body, don't sleep, they're watching 
 I watch CBS, and I see BS 
 Trying to track us down with GPS 
 Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins 
 Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box 
 And unplug from the Matrix doctrine 
 But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching 
 Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins 
 Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box 
 And unplug from the Matrix doctrine 
 But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill 
 But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill? 
 What about Cheney and Halliburton? 
 The back door deals on oil fields? 
 How is Nas the most violent person? 
 Y'all don't know talent if it hit you 
 Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol 
 I use Viacom as my firearm 
 Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon? 
 Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n 
 I'm dealing with the higher form 
 Fuck if you care of how I write a poem 
 Only fox that I loved was the Red one 
 Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one 
 Red rum, political bedlam 
 Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum 
 Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus 
 And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches 
  
 [Interlude: Deep voice] 
 I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth 
 Not the biased truth 
 Not the liest truth 
 But the highest truth 
 I will not be deceived 
 Nor will I believe in the propaganda 
 I will not fall for the okie-doke 
 I am tuned in... 
  
 [Outro] 
 Watch what they watching 
 Watch what you're watching 
 Better watch because they're watching 
 Watch what you're watching 
 M-m-media, misleading you 
 Watch what you're watching[Intro]

 [Verse 1] 
 January 28, 1968 
 Born into this world, William Griffin The Great 
 Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island 
 Scientific rhyming invented a new style when 
 He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst 
 The melody they created was the first 
 Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this 
 '87 dropped a classic disc 
 The facts is the tracklist was like full 
 The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl 
 Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge 
 That's why it's so relative 
 This biography was unauthorized 
 I spit it how it was given to author Nas 
 William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah 
 Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock 
 Gods on every block, jams in every park 
 I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying 
 "It can't get better than this" 
 'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits 
 From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks 
 First million-dollar deal ever in rap 
 18th Letter did that 
 From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA 
 We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre 
 Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap 
 Fort Greene, Queens, Long Island wolfpack 
 Paid In Full posse, hot they was on 
 And Ra had his firstborn 
 With the next line I'ma be easy 
 His wisdom's name is Fifi 
 EPMD put a record out, was dope 
 Tension spread, and I quote 
 "Smack me and I smack you back" 
 Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track 
 For a second it ain't look good 
 Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood 
 Misunderstood, all forgot 
 At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx 
 Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was 
 How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways 
 Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP 
 A sophisticated mean one 
 Before similar voices were King Sun 
 A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom 
 At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized 
 Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides 
 He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes 
 Walk with me now 
  
 [Outro] 
 Unauthorized Biography of Rakim 
 Epilogue: Mother was a jazz singer 
 Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown 
 Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique 
 That's the end of the group, went on for solo 
 Dropped "The R", then The 18th Letter, then I think something, The Master 
 Was signed to Aftermath 
 Scheduled to release an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre 
 The album was dismantled because of creative differences 
 The end 
 To the new beginning, yeah 
 Next book, KRS-One. Peace[Intro] 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes 
 (A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones 
 (A mastermind) everything planned out perfect 
 In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
 (A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy 
 (A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book 
 (A mastermind) never do a thing irrational 
 Lives forever, these tales are classical 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Velvet bow ties 
 Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by 
 In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds 
 And my principal is to study drama 
 Look what happened in Manhattan 
 A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin' 
 Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran 
 They was amateurs in beef with a grown man 
 It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand 
 And how the weak end up in a coffin 
 Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man 
 Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man 
 Make your enemies believe there's love there 
 'Cause in war, belief is all fair 
 Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep 
 And you ain't never know the plot was from me 
 It's from my masterminds 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes 
 (A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones 
 (A mastermind) everything planned out perfect 
 In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
 (A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy 
 (A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book 
 (A mastermind) never do a thing irrational 
 Lives forever, these tales are classical 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It ain't a game it's the life 
 Think it's a game, you lame 
 And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot 
 Toast to my hero Nat Turner 
 Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis 
 Whispered in her earlobe, "drive home" 
 'Cause she the wife and they the freaks 
 The underneath my girl caliber 
 They smiled at her and said "Goodbye" 
 With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us 
 My bodyguards in my Denali truck 
 Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs 
 That I don't really get down with 
 They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks 
 So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link 
 I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth 
 They used to spray troops, now they managing groups 
 The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82 
 Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do 
 That was back when I had no crew, I switched that 
 Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong 
 My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep 
 Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be 
 But I'm a mastermind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes 
 (A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones 
 (A mastermind) everything planned out perfect 
 In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
 (A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy 
 (A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book 
 (A mastermind) never do a thing irrational 
 Lives forever, these tales are classical 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable 
 I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you 
 Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine 
 Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find 
 This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes 
 Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it 
 Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it 
 Made millions every three months, new jury 
 I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho 
 That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it 
 Squares, they into voodoo 
 She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who 
 Would come and try to kill you too 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes 
 (A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones 
 (A mastermind) everything planned out perfect 
 In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
 (A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy 
 (A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book 
 (A mastermind) never do a thing irrational 
 Lives forever, these tales are classicalMa, I'm sorry who the fuck I AM, I can't trust my fans 
 Out of luck, no constructive plans 
 My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand 
 You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man 
 Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't 
 But every church in the world can't save our children 
 I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be 
 Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately 
 Them bullets had some other names on it, a brother was blind 
 I hit the L, then we yell out, "It wasn't my time!" 
 I loaded up shells, one by one, you smelled blunt from my room door 
 Little Nasir was at war 
 And little did I care what you saw 
 Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score 
  
 But in the projects, I visit Muhammad, in linen garments 
 Preaching Man, Woman, and Child, the living Prophet 
 And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara 
 Visqu Allah, fist full of dollars in the dice game God 
 The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance 
 Clothes fit me like a crime boss, the medicine man 
 I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies 
 Young girls are unfastening they Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic 
 All this fashion and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary 
 N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me 
  
 Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with money bags 
 Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast 
 And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York 
 You show off, I count off when you sample my voice 
 I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens 
 Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding? 
 Is he H to the izzo, M to the izzo? 
 For shizzle you phony, the rapper version of Sisqo 
 And that's for certain, you cloned me, your wack clothes line 
 I'd rather Sean John, bore me with your fake coke rhymes 
 And those times, they never took place, you liar 
 Un was your first court case, you had no priors 
 You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick 
 Have you surrounded, you and them faggot you down with 
  
 While they riding NAS, trying to boost their careers 
 Corny as Cormega, all you Hip-Hop queers 
 Since Illmatic, It Was Written: I Am... Nastradamus 
 That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise 
 My next few albums, instead of projects 
 They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics 
  
 Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark 
 Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx 
 Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts 
 New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block 
 I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page 
 Did crimes and headline on stage 
 I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it 
 Streets Disciple, I'm Stillmatic[Intro: Nas] 
 Dre, he a Compton-Compton OG 
 Nas, he a QB-QB true G 
 Do the history 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Way before The Firm, like back in the day 
 Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre 
 So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face 
 The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away 
 But we still get together, like, every several years 
 To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears 
 Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers 
 Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage 
 I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes 
 Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by 
 I like to celebrate, why? ‘Cause I can vision 
 Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate 
 So every breath I take is all about the rules 
 It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude 
 So crack the Patron, it's on heathens 
 The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin' 
  
 [Hook: Marsha] 
 Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders 
 Make that cake, cop two five fivers 
 Pimps and players, platinum diamonds 
 East to West Coast, we riders 
  
 [Bridge: Nas + (Game)] 
 He a Compton-Compton OG 
 (Mix that with a QB-QB true G, what you got's) 
 A concoction of some different ghetto blocks 
 (West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots) 
  
 [Verse 2: Game] 
 1995, eleven years from today 
 I'm in the record shop with choices to make 
 Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie 
 Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me 
 So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack 
 Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that 
 For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed 
 I was the only Compton nigga with a "New York State of Mind" 
 Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm 
 Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn 
 Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn 
 Ended my peers' careers 
 Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned 
 So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga 
 I stopped beefin' with niggas, ‘cause I'm "Ether" to niggas 
 Comb the earth 'til there's no one left 
 If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death 
  
 [Bridge: Nas + (Game)] 
 He a Compton-Compton OG 
 (Mix that with a QB-QB true G, what you got's) 
 A concoction of some different ghetto blocks 
 (West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots) 
  
 [Hook: Marsha] 
 Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders 
 Make that cake, cop two five fivers 
 Pimps and players, platinum diamonds 
 East to West Coast, we riders 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Yo, the Jordans sportin', come off the dice game 
 With a fortune walkin', you a walking coffin' 
 The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bust it 
 You're sideways talking, so I lay often 
 I wait patient, to duct tape hatin' 
 Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas 
 Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas 
 That's my name and I came with Rugers this time 
 And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb 
 Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm 
 You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me 
 Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting 
 See that's malarky you yappin' 
 I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin' 
 Nasty man, from bagging grams and runnin' from cops 
 To a mil on the hand, a mil on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc 
  
 [Hook: Marsha] 
 Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders 
 Make that cake, cop two five fivers 
 Pimps and players, platinum diamonds

 (Who's world is this?) 
 (Who's world is this?) 
 La la la, la la la 
 (Who's world is this?) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged 
 Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
 To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement 
 Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 A fiend of hip-hop, it's got me stuck like a crack pipe 
 The mind activation, react like I'm facin' 
 Time like 'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin' 
 Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets 
 And the Nikes on my feet keep my cipher complete 
 Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep 
 I can't call it, beats make me fallin' asleep 
 I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Take money) 
 I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The world is yours 
 Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Yeah, the world is yours 
 To the phillie bluntheads, crack-pumpin' drug murderers 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The world is yours 
 To my niggas comin' home from lockdown with new plans 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Fuck it, the world is mine 
 Holdin' a stolen cop's Glock with G-notes in my hand 
 (Whose world is this?) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 To my man Ill Will, God bless your life 
 To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life 
 My insight enlights vision 
 Words of wisdom, niggas pay me intuition to listen 
 To murder paragraphs of mysticism 
 Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds 
 So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free 
 Son, I need weed to proceed 
 Change the flow speed and I'm gettin' vex Giuliani you 6-6-6 
 There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays 
 I toke the chocolate potent phillies never roach-sprayed 
 Shit is a hassle, the Bridge is like a haunted castle 
 The mic's my religion, the system is the Devil's lasso 
 And yo, the trife life is the most influential 
 Though colors on men's skins and pens is coincidental 
 How you livin', large or broker? 
 You're wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers 
 Catchin' court papers gettin' broker 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The world is mine 
 Persona of late Tony Montana yet gettin' mine 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The whole world is mine 
 Who want it, I never front it, I'm forever blunted, hittin' lye 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Henny up with the lye (La la la) 
 Never stop, we don't stop (La la la) 
 The Hennylo, puffin' lye y'all (La la la) 
 Don't stop the Hennylo (La la la) 
 Who puff the lye? (La la la) 
 Everyday, puff the lye plus the Hennylo (La la la) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed 
 For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded 
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne 
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside a thousand miles from home 
 I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow 
 'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow 
 Tryin' to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip 
 Picturin' my peeps not eatin' could make my heartbeat skip 
 And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs 
 Headed for Indiana, stabbin' bitches like the Phantom 
 The crew is lampin' Ill Will style 
 Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild 
 Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge 
 Walk the blocks with a bop 
 Checkin' dames plus the games people play 
 I check the games plus the games people play 
 Bust the problems of the world today 
  
 [Break] 
 (Who's world is this?) 
 (Who's world is this?) 
 (Who's world is this?) 
 (Who's world is this?) 
 (Who's world is this?)

 [Outro] 
 Yeah yeah, yeah Wizard, keep that lye in the air 
 Yo, I wanna give a shout out to the whole fuckin' Queens 
 My man Tipster on the boards, keepin' it real Lord 
 The Queensbridge nation, get it on 
 Fakin' no fuckin' jacks, fuck around and get your wig pushed back 
 And big shoutout to my man Killa, Ron Du, it's on you 
 L.E.S. on another murder quest 
 '94, we out 
 Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere 
 Keep the la la goin'...[Produced by  Carlos "6 July" Broady & Nashiem Myrick] 
  
 [Intro] 
 See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil 
 If you don't bring that shit around you 
 You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh) 
 Yeah (yeah, uh-huh) 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 Yo, yo yo yo 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin 
 She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan 
 Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat 
 She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat 
 Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old 
 She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's 
 Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit 
 She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick 
 At my man's wake, she said the eulogy 
 After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery 
 Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math 
 Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's 
 Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg 
 Yo niggas said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads 
 She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her" 
 A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy 
 She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck 
 She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack 
 She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby 
 She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me 
 I jetted though, sometimes you never know 
 He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Nigga you reap what you sow 
 What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know 
 A very small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Where beef could never end 
 At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now 
 Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow 
 Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..") 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home 
 From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers 
 Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it 
 5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks 
 Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low 
 Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O 
 Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo 
 He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though 
 Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard" 
 Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her 
 Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller 
 Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over 
 A year went past, Snook went flossing fast 
 His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Nigga you reap what you sow 
 What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know 
 A very small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Where beef could never end 
 At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now 
 Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow 
 Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..") 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why 
 We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull 
 Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite 
 Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast 
 Snook was one of ‘em, so many more 
 Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour 
 Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich 
 Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God 
 Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job 
 He was close to her ever since she took him inside 
 When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85 
 He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive 
 He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried 
 Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died 
 He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard 
 Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em 
 I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on 
 And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing 
 Out the way as my Taurus spray 
 Jump in the whip, hit the highway 
 You know how I say, the game that I play 
 It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies 
 But can't figure out whose who, keep it true 
 Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never 
 'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Nigga you reap what you sow 
 What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know 
 A very small world ("It's a.. small world..") 
 Where beef could never end 
 At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again 
 It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now 
 Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow 
 Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..") 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'm going to see you again.. 
 Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga.. 
 Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah[Produced by Dave Scratch] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail 
 The mic is contacted, I attract clientele 
 My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining 
 Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing 
 Cause in my physical, I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The Buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell 
 I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a Tec with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose 
 Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again 
 Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks 
 MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep I never fail 
 Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Outro Scratches] 
 The type of lyrical terrorism I present[Verse 1] 
 Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley 
 Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney 
 Brazilian candy, from Miami 
 Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion 
 Hate rap, told me where she get cake at 
 She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer 
 Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to 
 Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers 
 Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree 
 33, recovering from plastic surgery 
 Went from 34B to 36 double D 
 Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party 
 Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis 
 MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated 
 I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators 
 When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas 
 Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders 
 A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers 
 It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love 
 Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub 
 Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet 
 Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug 
 Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character 
 Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips 
 Givin' head like she knew me for years 
 Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs 
 Millions she would get if his neck got slit 
 She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me 
 Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy 
 He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport 
 Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort 
 You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear 
 Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere 
 So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin' 
 Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin' 
 P-11's, ACP shells for blastin' 
 Caught him with his Spanish maid 
 He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs 
 She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic 
 Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence 
 His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold 
 Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo 
 Twelve point five million, he kept his funds 
 In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children 
 Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision 
 All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision" 
 I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland 
 Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight 
 The same night, headed to Spain, nice game 
 Now we're back to where we meet a-gain... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley 
 Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney 
 Top down, night air blow her hair 
 Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare 
 Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash 
 Took a blast out of her coke bag 
 Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed 
 Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass 
 Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep 
 Overwhelmed by greed, put to death[Produced Eric B] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Ayo Nasty Nas, what up? 
 ~Ain't nothing, a lot of cowards fronting 
 I hear what you're saying, but yo, this is all love for me, you know? 
 ~No doubt, smoke them cowards, you stillmatic 
  
 [Verse] 
 Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I am, I can't trust my fans 
 Out of luck, no constructive plans 
 My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand 
 You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man 
 Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't 
 But every church in the world can't save our children 
 I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be 
 Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately 
 Them bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind 
 I hit the L, then, we yell out, "It wasn't my time!" 
 I loaded up shells, one by one 
 You smelled blunts from my room door, little Nasir was at war 
 And little did I care what you saw 
 Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score 
 But in the projects, I vision Muhammad, in linen garments 
 Preaching man, woman, and child, the living Prophet 
 And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah 
 Fist full of dollars in the dice game, God 
 The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance 
 Clothes fit me like a crime boss, the medicine man 
 I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies 
 Young girls are unfastening their Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic 
 All this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary 
 N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me 
 Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with MoneyBags 
 Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast 
 And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York 
 You show off, I count dough off when you sample my voice 
 I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens 
 Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding? 
 Is he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O? 
 For shizzle you phony, the rapping version of Sisqo 
 And that's for certain, you clone me, your wack clothes line 
 I'd rather Sean John, you bore me with your fake coke rhymes 
 And those times, they never took place, you liar 
 Un was your first court case, you had no priors 
 You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick 
 Have you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with 
 While they riding Nas, trying to boost their careers 
 Corny as Cormega, all you Hip-Hop queers 
 Since Illmatic, It Was Written, I Am Nastradamus 
 That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise 
 My next few albums, instead of projects 
 They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics 
 Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark 
 Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx 
 Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts 
 New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block 
 I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page 
 Did crimes and headline on stage 
 I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it 
 Street's Disciple, I'm Stillmatic 
  
 [Female voice sample] 
 You make me feel so good[Intro: Nas (Flo Simpson)] 
 Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream... 
 (America) just to figure out 
 You wasn't dreaming in the first place 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster 
 Pussy and money the only language I clung ta 
 Claim ta, I mold myself up to become one 
 Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster 
 Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements 
 Cultural strata, persona is that of a non-needer 
 Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver 
 For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless 
 To my G's on the flee from the coppers 
 Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors 
 From the slums I come up a phoenix caked up 
 Trying to take what I'm eating came up a dismissive kid 
 You lucky if you allowed to witness this 
 Savvy, mild, wild hardly 
 A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties 
 Jezebels and Stella McCartneys 
 For years, all that, how can I not be dead? 
 This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head 
 Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled 
 With a face like he wonder where I got my bread 
 Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas 
 From crime to rhyme, my story is I'm from the home of the thieves 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (Flo Simpson)] 
 America (Americaaaaaa) pay attention 
 Wake up, this is not what you think it is 
 America (Americaaaaaa) pay attention 
 This is not what you think it is 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be 
 Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy 
 Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro 
 He'd want me to spit this 
 Only the strong survive Nas bear witness 
 The hypocrisy is all I can see 
 White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea 
 That type of shit make me stop and think 
 We in chronic need of a second look of the law books 
 And the whole race dichotomy 
 Too many rappers athletes and actors 
 But not enough niggas in NASA 
 Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion? 
 But when it comes to residuals they look past us 
 Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us 
 Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (Flo Simpson)] 
 America (Americaaaaaa) pay attention 
 Wake up, this is not what you think it is 
 America (Americaaaaaa) pay attention 
 This is not what you think it is 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Assassinations, diplomatic relations 
 Killed indigenous people built a new nation 
 Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval 
 Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her 
 If I could travel to the 1700's 
 I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant 
 Love to sit on the Senate and tell the whole government 
 Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the bible 
 Believing she the reason sin is here 
 You played her, with an apron, like "bring me my dinner dear" 
 She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world? 
 Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls 
 Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually 
 Bugging how I made it out the hood dazzle me 
 How far are we really from third world savagery? 
 When the empire fall imagine how crazy that'll be 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (Flo Simpson)] 
 America (Americaaaaaa, Americaaaaaa) 
 America (Americaaaaaa) 
 This is not what you think it is 
 America (Americaaaaaa) 
 This is not what you think it is 
 America[Intro: Barack Obama] 
 They said this day would never come 
 They said our sights were set too high 
 This country is too divided, too disillusioned 
 To ever come together around a common purpose. They said 
  
 [Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)] 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can change the world, the world, the world 
 {CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 The world, the world, the WORLD... 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 They forgot us on the block, got us in the box 
 Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops? 
 They need a early retirement 
 How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march 
 I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought 
 Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex 
 My set, my clique, either getting money 
 Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet 
 Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance 
 A predicate felon, a ghetto leader 
 Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it 
 I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up 
 Never defeated, so a president's needed 
 You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see 
 One of their own succeeding 
 America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)] 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 {CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 The world, the world, the WORLD... 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 What's the black pres' thinking on election night? 
 Is it: "How can I protect my life? 
 Protect my wife? Protect my rights?" 
 Every other president was nothing less than white 
 Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge 
 KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up 
 Loading up mine too, ready to ride 
 'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too 
 Yeah, but on the positive side 
 I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds 
 Of all races and colors to erase the hate 
 And try to love one another, so many political snakes 
 We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother 
 ...but will he keep it way real? 
 Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal 
 When he wins, will he really care still? 
 I feel 
  
 [Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)] 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 {CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 The world, the world, the WORLD... 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Say a prayer for "Do we have to?" 
 You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor 
 In love with a slave master 
 Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper 
 Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper 
 Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter 
 Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what 
 Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter 
 Deacon for defense, progress-producer 
 Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster 
 Gotta do what we gotta do 
 We ain't got no governors coming through to help 
 Anything we need done, gotta do for self 
 New, improved JFK on the way 
 It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again 
 We ain't falling for the same traps 
 Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at 
 McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that 
 People need honesty 
  
 [Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)] 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 {CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 ("Although it seems heaven-sent 
 We ain't ready, to have a black president") 
 Yes we can, change the world 
 The world, the world, the WORLD...

 [Nas talking] 
 The light is there 
  
 [Intro: Olu Dara singing] 
 See I come from Mississippi 
 I was young and runnin' wild 
 Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child 
 I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas 
 I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Let's go!... 
 Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey -- 
 Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered 
 Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it 
 But I'm still number one, everyday real 
 Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel 
 Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss 
 Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi 
 Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy 
 Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap 
 The history of music on this track 
 Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
 Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain 
 But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids 
 Some are well-known, some doin' bids 
 I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks 
 If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo 
  
 [Olu Dara singing] 
 See I come from Mississippi 
 I was young and runnin' wild 
 Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child 
 I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas 
 I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive 
 Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!) 
 Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive! 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues 
 Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's 
 Old school, new school, know school rules 
 All these years I been voicin' my blues 
 I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart 
 Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent 
 But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with 
 Books to read, like X and stuff 
 Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia 
 In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of 
 Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up 
 Cause none'a them would like my style 
 Read more books than the curriculum profile 
 Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child 
 Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild" 
  
 [Olu Dara singing] 
 I was born in Mississippi 
 I was young and runnin' wild 
 Moved to New York City, where I had my first child 
 I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas 
 I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive 
 Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone 
 He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home 
 Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu 
 Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to 
  
 [Olu Dara singing] 
 I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique 
 Madagascar, Paris, Greece 
 The Middle Africa is where we lived 
 Better known as Queenbridge 
 [Nas] 
 Nas, Nas you don't stop 
 Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop 
 Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop 
 From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop 
 Tell 'em Pop 
  
 [Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing] 
 See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know) 
 I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild) 
 Ended up in New York City (Yeah!) 
 Where I had my first child (That's me) 
 I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!) 
 All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy) 
 I told him as a youngster 
 He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop) 
 Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop) 
 Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive! 
 Rest In Peace Ray Charles[Verse 1] 
 One .44, two .45's 
 Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives 
 Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die 
 We shooting every mothafucka outside 
 Pulled on his block, jumped out the car 
 Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran 
 There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd 
 Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground 
 Blood on the floor then we shot some more 
 Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell 
 One tried to run, go get him son 
 Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail 
 Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat 
 If these nigga think they could fuck around 
 Real niggas do real things by all means 
 Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder) 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder) 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet 
 Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way 
 To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house 
 Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out 
 Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at? 
 I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at 
 Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack? 
 Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan 
 There them bitches go, Civic '94 
 Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile 
 Fuck two already, third ass was heavy 
 "Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?" 
 Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes 
 Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like 
 Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam 
 Now I'm wondering, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?" 
 He killed the hoes, took all they dough 
 Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs 
 Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine 
 Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time 
 My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering 
 "Put your gun down, we can skip town" 
 Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat 
 Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder) 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder) 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what? 
 (Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)[Intro] 
 A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life 
 But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there 
 You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby 
 That's my word 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Trust, my niggas come home from long bids 
 They check for me before they see their own kids 
 I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin' 
 Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers 
 Cop Ferraris with navigational screens 
 Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens 
 Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers 
 Bumpin' out old shit 
 That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves 
 Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up 
 From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt 
 100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts 
 Back then, nobody wore a vest 
 Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test 
 Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin' 
 Look at the chain, I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand 
 Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin' 
 Half of the crew probably on the island 
 Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger 
 Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought 
 Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife 
 For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto look for tomorrow 
 Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way 
 Gats spray these shorties is killers 
 The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller 
 And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in 
 Like 'who's you' when I cruise through 
 I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends 
 Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everything will eventually come to an end 
 So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it? 
 The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better 
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
 Everything will eventually come to an end 
 So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it? 
 The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better 
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin' 
 Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin' 
 Gucci, Iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs 
 One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs 
 Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2 
 Pool parties beautiful view 
 You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style 
 Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile 
 Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses 
 Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin' 
 Thinkin', "Damn, wish my niggas could afford this" 
 On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless 
 Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments 
 Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested 
 Worries of failure, when you buried with your familia 
 Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum 
 You should live, there's only one life that's the physical 
 Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable 
 Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin' 
 Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion 
 The bitch you love could start to hate you 
 The shit you use to do escape you 
 Things that make you laugh represent the past 
 Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor 
 Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more 
 Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down 
 Turned 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town 
 Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still 
 Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everything will eventually come to an end 
 So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it? 
 The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better 
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
 Everything will eventually come to an end 
 So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it? 
 The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better 
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever

 [Intro: Nas & Jae Supreme] 
 Yo, Nas whattup? 
 Whattup kid? 
 What going on Ill 
 I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm coming from 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Alright, kick it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm the nigga walking with his finger on the trigger 
 Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing 
 Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressing 
 I'm rolling with a mob and running from the cops 
 Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks 
 A marijuana addict, if niggas want static 
 They had it, 'cause I flip just like an acrobatic 
 I'm always on the corners rolling up Sess 
 When I dress it's never nothing less than Guess 
 So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back 
 Love committing sins and my friends sell crack 
 I got it going on, my knuckle game is strong 
 Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on 
 Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride 
 Stripping mad hoes and kick em to the side 
 See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder 
 Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners 
 At every block party, I try to catch a body 
 All for props, tell your pops call the cops 
 See now I'm on the run, but still having fun 
 Living by the MAC, my gear is all black 
 I keep killing because I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm a villain 
  
 [Hook] 
 What? 
 What? 
 Wha-a-a-t? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I got beef with the President and still loving it 
 Trying to make plans to overthrow the government 
 It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough 
 They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff 
 Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this 
 Rebel, but my country doesn't want me 
 They'd rather hunt me but you'll never catch us all 
 While you fucking with the dealers we'll be sticking up the malls 
 Full of anger, all about danger 
 Pulling out my banger, stabbing up a stranger 
 I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep 
 And use a whole lot of slang when I speak 
 Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest 
 And the streets keep me stressed 
 Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound 
 That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up 
 All in black and put you in a box 
 A hard rock with a .25 in my socks 
 Aiming at your temple so take the diamonds off your hands 
 I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz 
 Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear 
 And this you should fear 
 The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum 
 Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them 
 An outlaw, although I never wear a holster 
 In every town you see my face is on a poster 
 Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop 
 Eyesight should stop from seeing mad niggas drop 
 To the concrete, I got police putting chalk on the street 
 And this is done once a week 
 I'm out to kill like Navy Seals 
 I'm crazy ill and what I can't do my .380 will 
 I never play with a AK 
 Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time 
 Sometimes you gotta plan shit and understand it 
 See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch 
 Without a gun in it, Nas is running it 
 I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted 
 My voice is like magic 
 My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic 
 So when I'm in your town, "duck down" 
 Or take fire, whatever you desire 
 But I'm on point you might miss 
 Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this 
 So roll the dice, I'm stopping the bank 
 It's ill how I got the pen dropping the ink 
 No one can stop this apocalypse 
 On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor 
 Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer 
 I'm the New York City slayer 
 I play high post and then lay low 
 Parlé slow and wear horns, not a halo 
 And keep killing 'cause I'm a villain[Intro] 
 Uhh, uhh, where am I going 
 Where am I? 
 Yo, it's ill 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me 
 Life tries ducking me 
 Luckily I find 'em just at the right time 
 MAC in my right arm 
 Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión 
 Watching my life go 
 Can't do myself in 
 Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men 
 Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin 
 Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit 
 Buck-sixty who wit' me? 
 My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience 
 Telling me that I ain't shit 
 No matter how much cash I sit with 
 Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness 
 My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain 
 To replenish my adolescent brain 
 Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane 
 So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain 
 I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets 
 Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat 
 Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive 
 As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is 
 To maintain, bitches playin' games 
 Niggas snitchin' 
 I ain't saying names 
 But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang 
 Lost so many close niggas 
 Drunk, almost crashed 
 I'm going too fast 
 Highway patrol will just flash 
 Lights in my rearview 
 If they stop me I hope they lock me 
 Instead they speed ahead 
 Yo nigga watch me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand 
 Trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once 
 Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts 
 For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves 
 Can't tell them niggas nothing though 
 Bullets wake 'em up well 
 Take them to hell 
 Stick up niggas once ran up on me 
 My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me 
 I ain't your mark homey 
 It's hard to look straight 
 My foot on the brake 
 Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes 
 Could hardly look both ways 
 Put out the haze blurry vision 
 Think about the time in my life before I was in television 
 Hella women 
 Jealous niggas up in my vision 
 Since we all hood niggas expect kilos 
 For what they not seeing is police expect Rico 
 Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated 
 Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me 
 I hate it when I'm like this 
 The bottle's my accomplice 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand 
 Trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The reason that I want to be alone 
 Tired of all the things that went wrong 
 That would have went right if I would have did it on my own 
 Take another swig 
 The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts 
 Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down 
 Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through 
 Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true 
 Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately 
 Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again 
 To keep my mind off that weak shit 
 There's love through it all 
 Things to live for 
 I swerve, almost crash into a wall 
 Think about the good 
 Find myself laughing 
 Turn the cell off, no way to be reached 
 Know I'm near my crib 
 Tryna see my way through the streets 
 Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home 
 Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip 
 Bring my ass to the crib 
 I'm tired... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand 
 Trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uhh, yeah, uhh 
 Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days 
 Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair 
 His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me 
 Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me 
 It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer 
 I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya 
 'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water 
 Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order 
 Shit is plastic material, havin' no life 
 I crash whips and leave it no matter the price 
 As long as I survive, cop a new five 
 Circle the block where the beef's at 
 And park in front of my enemy's eyes 
 They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters 
 There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers 
 And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth 
 Watchin' your own murder reoccur 
  
 [Chorus: Blitz] 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
  
 [Verse 2: Blitz] 
 It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me 
 Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me 
 Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust 
 Greed and contempt, no street is exempt 
 Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks 
 I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks 
 Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain 
 Fallin deep into the pits of the game 
 This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times 
 Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime 
 Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside 
 In the ghetto with a million ways to die 
 Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game 
 Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain 
 What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax 
 I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes 
 Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business 
 Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders 
 But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships 
 Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor 
 How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse 
 Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin' 
 Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones 
 Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex 
 And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des 
 Got guns when I'm with my daughter 
 Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence 
 She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons 
 Black princess it's a ugly world 
 I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl 
 Could you believe even my shadow's jealous 
 My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones 
 My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs 
 Though my songs come from the Father 
 I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker 
  
 [Chorus: Blitz] 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning[Verse 1] 
 Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain 
 I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same 
 I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame 
 Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything 
 Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers 
 A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss 
 Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight 
 Livin' my life like everyday's my last night 
 Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood 
 Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug 
 Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs 
 To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs 
 How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on? 
 Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms 
 Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints 
 That's cool, but I'ma live how I want 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 (I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats 
 (I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps 
 (I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard 
 (I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door 
 (I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said 
 (I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead 
 (I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me 
 (I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers 
 Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air 
 Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank 
 And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat 
 And just to think some would die to get what I got 
 They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot 
 Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not 
 But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot 
 Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped 
 No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open 
 I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm 
 He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond 
 I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours? 
 Did he die in vain or represent for the cause? 
 Now I put his name on everything I'm involved 
 And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will) 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 (I did it my way) from crumbs, roaches and rats 
 (I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps 
 (I did it my way) I call it how I see it niggas 
 (I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it niggas 
 (I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans 
 (I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can 
 (I did it my way) takin' sacrifices kid 
 (I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies 
 Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony 
 From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil 
 They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel 
 Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time 
 '89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time 
 In just two years, their crew disappear 
 Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures 
 Years back, I reminisce and remember 
 Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters 
 Just a baby nigga thankful 
 When them killers came through, guns out, movin' 
 I thank the ones who said 
 "Shorty, go home!", we about to be shootin' 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 (I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats 
 (I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps 
 (I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard 
 (I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door 
 (I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said 
 (I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead 
 (I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me 
 (I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat[Intro: Nas] 
 Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it 
 And hope somebody learn somethin' from it 
 And give it back 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas & Both] 
 They can't break me or shake me 
 They too fake to come kill me 
 Think they faith is with Satan 
 They mistake me I'm filthy 
 Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dare me 
 It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty 
 Middle Passage I made it 
 I'm from the land of David 
 The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets 
 Y'all bunch of backward gangsters 
 Y'all signin affidavits 
 Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this 
 Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy 
 I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried 
 Kind of weird and it's scary 
 All my years have prepared me 
 What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center 
 Right through a man's soul 
 Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart 
 I'm still alive, how did I make it this far? 
 'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go 
 Every single night I pray 
 And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found 
 I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys] 
 This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song) 
 Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior) 
 Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime 
 I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke 
 Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket 
 Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid 
 I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral 
 Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real 
 Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still 
 I can't go on, responsible for so many 
 Her last days at the hospital 
 Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas 
 Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy 
 She raised me in the projects alone 
 Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body 
 Got me ready to body somethin' quickly 
 Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me 
 So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls 
 To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys] 
 This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song) 
 Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior 
 Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas & Both] 
 Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see 
 When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies 
 I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful 
 If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior) 
 It only made me stronger 
 But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya 
 Sometimes I wish I was dead 
 But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah) 
 'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go 
 Every single night I pray 
 And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found 
 I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys & Nas] 
 This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior) to my warriors 
 Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior) 
 Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum 
 This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song) 
 Warriors, baby, KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all 
 Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior) 
 Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion 
 To everybody that lost their mother, their father 
 Rest in peace moms! 
 My mother's last words: Never give up 
 A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war 
 Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin' 
 Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up 
 To all my warriors, haha 
 Braveheart, Braveheart 
 Definition of a warrior, ha[Produced by Live Squad, Lo Ground & Top General Sounds] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 {*whispered*} 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple 
 Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time on pursuit moves in 
 Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit 
 Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick 
 Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung 
 Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue 
 It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer 
 The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia 
 The cognac plurger plus the trees 
 But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze? 
 And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype 
 Used to be a general but just lost his stripe 
 Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters 
 Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress 
 Since I got a problem with the law-writers 
 I kick some more items just to explore horizons 
 The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play 
 The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay 
  
 [Chorus] 
 {*whispered*} 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast 
 A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas 
 Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz 
 Fuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass 
 Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics 
 Living practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards 
 So wear it if the cap fits 
 Folded up money and mad clips 
 A stack right under my mattress 
 To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brothers motion picture 
 Niggas getting open crews, roping older niggas 
 April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches 
 Seeds outside, my nigga spoke on his sentence 
  
 [Chorus] 
 {*whispered*} 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My right-handers never play too close to cameras 
 It's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers 
 Peace making niggas pep talk 
 The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew 
 Time to get this loot countless, 'cause son it ain't no youth fountains 
 Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians are took hostage 
 Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up 
 What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors? 
 Lock the real niggas down and letting fake players 
 Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic 
 I dilute, the weak can inject the right composite 
 When plotting on murderous schemes 
 It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens 
 The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play 
 The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay 
  
 [Chorus] 
 {*whispered*} 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
 Silent, silent murder 
  
 [Outro] 
 And Cain killed his brother Abel 
 When God accepted Abel's offering and not his 
 Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God 
 And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder - 
 Drove him to murder[Produced by Nas & Trackmasters]

 1996! 
 Back up in this nigga 
 The right way, though, you know? 
 (Double-tre son, you know ain't nothin' coincidental or accidental, dunn) 
 No doubt! 
 (You know how it's goin' down, man) 
 It was all written 
 (No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man 
 You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son 
 They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?) 
 Son, I'm playin' with the 52 
 (You wanna stress on how I used to play, that's how I playin') 
 But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now 
 (I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law 
 Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin' 
 That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though) 
 True 
 (Yo, word up, though, you know what I mean?) 
 Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son 
 (Yeah, you see that they look Monopoly money, right?) 
 Word, with the big ass face on it 
 (Yo, what I'm sayin', we see through all that, though 
 You know what I'm sayin?) 
 No question 
 (All eyes seein', son, you know it was written, no question) 
 Yo, no doubt. In the Qu'ran it says Nas, the men 
 Nesa's the woman, you know? It was written[Intro]

 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit 
 On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot 
 Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas 
 Little kids scared cops, with red dots 
 Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors 
 Going back like black and white TVs with pliers 
 Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires 
 Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on 
 Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up 
 And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em 
 Cops see them and run, don't want no drama 
 Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of 
 Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota 
 Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace 
 He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians 
 From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss 
 Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh 
 Lightning hits the top of the church steeple 
 When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen 
 It's frightening 
  
 [Hook x4] 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef 
 Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep 
 Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill 
 Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd 
 Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth 
 Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains 
 Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain 
 Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain 
 Got ill up on the train 
 Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein 
 Might've pushed you on the tracks 
 Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises 
 Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys 
 It's just another day in the hood 
 And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good 
 We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em 
 But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em 
 Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes 
 Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going 
 And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life 
 For the thieves who come out at night 
  
 [Hook x4] 
  
 [Outro] 
 One, two 
 Check, one, two 
 One, two 
 Check, one, two 
 One, two, who got more style, the son do[Nas] 
 Look here see 
 Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal 
 Found the body dead in the isles 
 Death by strangulation 
 Microphone cord, a dirty broad 
 Guess they'll never play it again Sam 
 Damn that was my jam 
 Now she's on the lam 
 She made it out with 200 grand 
 What a scam 
 While these two compete on who's the star of the show 
 Golden legs there makes off with the dough 
 I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher 
 "He said one glance is all it took ya 
 She's a real looker 
 They say her old mans a bootlegger 
 Transporting in any weather 
 And at this rate we'll never get her." 
 Fellas, think it's time to call it a night 
 All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight 
 Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 
 Hate to spoil the party 
 "What are you guys havin', the same? 
 Waiter another round for the gang." 
 It's strange how I always felt outta place 
 Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face 
 So I said "See you later." 
 'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 
 He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators 
 An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper 
 So I pulled the revolver on my waist up 
 Between the patrol car and the gray truck 
 Behind the street lamp was a silouhette 
 White gloves and a real long cigarette 
 What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope 
 She spoke, says, "The devil got you guys by the throat 
 Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence 
 That's the reason why Eric B. is not president." 
  
 Well what do ya say 
  
 Ya see? 
 Ya see? 
 Ya see? 
  
 Look here see 
 I know you got soul you're trying to hide it 
 How did you kill a man out in Cypress 
 One Eyed Charlie 
 He only hangs with the criminal minded 
 Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin' 
 She says, "Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story." 
 We hit the bodega got her a few 40's 
 We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried 
 Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 
 Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty 
 Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy 
 The truth came out as we got to her suave house 
 Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch 
 I said, "It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight 
 Who's ya sponsor lady?" She says, "Bill Gates." 
 What are ya born 77 or 78? 
 She says, "Nah it goes way to an earlier date 
 Slave times," claims the slaves said rhymes 
 But she fell in love with some fella named Clive 
 Who? "Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx." 
 Now she shows me the cash 
 I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt 
 She said Clive Campbell 
 He's Kool Herc 
  
 Ah-ha! 
 Ah-ha! 
  
 Listen up sweetheart 
 Now we gettin somewhere 
 As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air 
 But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died 
 She said if you really love me I'll come back alive[Produced by L.E.S] 
  
 [Intro] 
 To my niggas.. huh.. 
 We all we got.. 
 Let's hold it down though, y'know? 
 However it's gon' go down 
 This what we gotta deal with, y'know? 
 Yo.. 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes 
 And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh) 
 This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes 
 And the only way out, is death or going broke 
 This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings 
 That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it 
 And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo.. 
 (But yo..) this life is the only life I know... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
 Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen 
 Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green 
 Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall 
 My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine 
 Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines 
 Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team 
 Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides 
 Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast 
 Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying 
 'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science 
 My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it 
 They never know we enemies until they hear me say it 
 Til they kid's on the phone saying, "Please daddy pay it" 
 Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement 
 High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss 
 You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence 
 It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think 
 You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep 
 Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink 
 You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink 
 Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles 
 Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico 
 It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust 
 You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck 
 And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what? 
 Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the life we chose, where friends become foes 
 And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know 
 This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes 
 And the only way out, is death or going broke 
 This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings 
 That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it 
 And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo.. 
 This life is the only life I know... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough? 
 He wanna stick you 
 What's love, you got beef? 
 Nobody rolling with you 
 What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care 
 Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear? 
 What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho 
 And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo' 
 What's real, when you talk behind a man's back 
 Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that? 
 What's trust, when they separate your case 
 When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face 
 What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man? 
 And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'? 
 What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate? 
 They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day? 
 God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire 
 Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire 
 But everybody's different, you won't know how you react 
 Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact 
 The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong? 
 You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you 
 Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90 
 On your deathbed you regret being grimy 
 What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug? 
 A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs? 
 Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse 
 When he come home to catch another case? 
 Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it 
 You did it, heaven or hell or prison 
 Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up 
 Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya 
 You getting older player, look at those who gave up 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the life we chose, where friends become foes 
 And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know 
 This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes 
 And the only way out, is death or going broke 
 This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings 
 That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it 
 And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo.. 
 This life is the only life I know...[Intro] 
 Uh 
 Crazy (crazy), ah (ah) 
 Yo pussy kill me... 
 Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah.. 
 Huh, huh, huh, huh.. 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Pussy killed me when I was born (What?) 
 Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying 
 I look at the bright side 
 The fact that I got a life side 
 Born '73 - September right Nas? (True) 
 Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round 
 On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage 
 To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage 
 Niggas is some nasty creatures (word) 
 Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up 
 Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts 
 Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch) 
 Now he looking for me, two cars deep 
 Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, "You Nas peeps?" 
 I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that 
 Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at 
 I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble 
 I pissing bubbles 
 I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers 
 When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in 
 Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em 
 Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks 
 Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers 
 And basketball players, the bitch is a ho 
 But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat 
 You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?) 
 She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her 
 She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er 
 And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Oh what a thrill 
 Inside a bitch feel 
 Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real 
 Pussy kills 
 Backs shots keep a nigga open 
 Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking 
 Huh, pussy kills 
 Oh what a thrill 
 Inside a bitch feel 
 Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real 
 Pussy kills 
 Backs shots keep a nigga open 
 Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking 
 Huh, pussy kills 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with 
 Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck 
 Studied for her Masters, part time nurse 
 I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking 
 I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek 
 Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike 
 'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like 
 Luke and Han Solo 
 Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no 
 It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods 
 And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy 
 Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating 
 Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even 
 Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by 
 This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some 
 Rolling up dutchies while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze 
 Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close 
 Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind? 
 He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind 
 She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend 
 Was stressed when she was leaving 
 Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing 
 He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing) 
 He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him 
 Yelling, "Ain't no telling where her lips have been!" 
 Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than 
 Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming 
 She said she missed her flight that evening 
 She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding 
 That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging 
 I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it 
 I'm like, "When you started acting like that? This is dumbness." 
 Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches 
 I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped 
 He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen 
 Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping 
 Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping 
 Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange 
 My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Oh what a thrill 
 Inside a bitch feel 
 Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real 
 Pussy kills 
 Backs shots keep a nigga open 
 Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking 
 Huh, pussy kills 
 Oh what a thrill 
 Inside a bitch feel 
 Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real 
 Pussy kills 
 Backs shots keep a nigga open 
 Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking 
 Huh, pussy kills[Intro] 
 Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit 
 Niggas want to talk about this money 
 About these cars, these homes, these labels 
 Clothes, sneakers, big money shit 
 Now everybody trying to get rich 
 Now get rich niggas, fuck it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Some rap pioneers be them crackheads 
 When they speak, you see missin' teeth 
 Silver chain with a silver piece 
 Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid 
 And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues 
 And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them 
 I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve 
 Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died 
 Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost 
 It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss 
 Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred 
 The Jewish stick together, friends in high places 
 We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win 
 See, everybody got a label 
 Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal 
 It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables 
  
 [Hook] 
 When they crown you and you rise up to your position 
 Carry on tradition 
 When they knight you, then you go to fight 
 Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition 
 Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition 
 Carry On Tradition 
 When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards 
 With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness 
 I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it 
 Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest 
 Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code 
 You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode 
 Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes 
 You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless 
 You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists 
 Niggas, I could've wrote your shit 
 I had off-time, was bored with this 
 I could've made my double-LP 
 Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus 
 Still came five on the charts with zero audience 
 The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit 
 Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya 
 You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer 
 Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us 
 The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now 
 From British Walkers and Argyles 
 Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now 
 Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's 
 Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me 
 Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up 
 Because I'm what? Every dime lust 
 We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up 
 If I want that or the whole world to peep it 
 Now carry on tradition 
 Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin' 
 Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em. I promise I carry on tradition 
  
 [Hook]Uhh, oooooh baby, baby 
 Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now slowly, thinking of all the things that oppose me 
 I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me 
 For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid 
 Dead in the street, it's so fucking pitiful 
 First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (ho) 
 Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable 
 Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do 
 But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha) 
 I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth 
 From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches 
 Can't keep they hands to theyself no more 
 I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a 
  
 [Hook] 
 Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch 
 You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down 
 So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony 
 You clone me, you wanna be me son, I'm the one and only 
 But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak 
 You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day 
 But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson 
 Concerning this mic profession, turn your direction 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy 
 It's childish; should I have to resort to violence? 
 Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album 
 And show you how to stay off my dick 
 That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man 
 When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans 
 No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection 
 You unlucky, I'm your fucking C-section 
 Plus I'm the last real nigga alive 
 Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high 
 Realize, how many classics I gave you 
 Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You can't be me, I'm trying to walk a straight line 
 Why they trying to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line 
 Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts 
 At the Player's Ball, Brioni suits, y'all birds watch 
 As real millionaire, shit'll take place 
 Evil as Hitler's hate-race people 
 This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace 
 To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan 
 Is not to destroy your man 
 But to bring more to mankind and teach 
 Every MC reach for your pens and papers 
 Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior? 
 Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand 
 And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that 
 And you my offspring, the boss sting 
 A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that 
 Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at? 
 Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me 
 If I ain't crying laughing, to the lions, throw your ass in 
 What the fuck was you niggas thinking? 
 Guns'll clutch if I get a inkling that you coming for the kingpin 
 But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha 
 Take me out, try try try, but you 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 You can't be me[Produced by Timbaland] 
  
 [Intro: Nas (Timbaland)] 
 (What?) Ever been in love? (C'mon) 
 Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real? 
 (Say what?) 'Cause it can't be fake 
 This ain't no game (C'mon) 
 You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh) 
 'Cause it's real out here (uh-huh) 
 So make up your mind, 'cause I ain't got no time 
 Y'know? (C'mon) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama 
 We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me 
 I won't stress you but bless you 
 Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual 
 Can't forget how I met you; 
 You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem 
 But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens 
 And when I gotcha - you riding with me 
 You keep asking, "When do you have time for me?" 
 I'm never free always on the move, business oriented 
 Lifestyle expensive, attract women 
 You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild 
 Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile? 
 Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me 
 Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying 
 Before you find what you looking for and get to crying 
 You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying 
  
 [Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)] 
 You won't see me tonight 
 You won't see me tomorrow 
 I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that) 
 And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right) 
 You'll go tell all your friends (that's right) 
 How you called and I follow (they know it) 
 But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that) 
 No you won't see me tomorrow 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister 
 I feel no guilt when I twist ya 
 Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha 
 You got your name on his lease, copy his keys 
 That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece 
 Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady 
 You page me, when you got the day free 
 But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps 
 You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites 
 Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami 
 But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang? 
 Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up 
 Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump 
 Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them 
 They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely 
 But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby 
  
 [Interlude: Aaliyah and Nas] 
 Call you on a Monday 
 I'll call you back baby 
 Call you on a Tuesday 
 My cell is off baby 
 Call you on a Wednesday 
 I'm out of town baby 
 You won't be back 'til Thursday 
 I'll page you back baby 
 Call you on a Monday 
 I'll call you back baby 
 Call you on a Tuesday 
 My cell is off baby 
 Call you on a Wednesday 
 I'm out of town baby 
 You won't be back 'til Thursday 
 I'll page you back baby 
  
 [Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)] 
 You won't see me tonight 
 You won't see me tomorrow 
 I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that) 
 And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right) 
 You'll go tell all your friends (that's right) 
 How you called and I follow (they know it) 
 But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that) 
 No you won't see me tomorrow 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Thinking of me, you getting the chills 
 Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels 
 Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy 
 Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money 
 And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs 
 Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires 
 You make a good wife to most men 
 I know I got you open 
 But -- you just my close friend 
 Get it baby 
  
 [Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)] 
 You won't see me tonight 
 You won't see me tomorrow 
 I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that) 
 And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right) 
 You'll go tell all your friends (that's right) 
 How you called and I follow (they know it) 
 But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that) 
 No you won't see me tomorrow 
  
 [Bridge: Nas (Aaliyah)] 
 The God, the God, the God, Nasir (you won't see me tonight) 
 The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (you won't see me tomorrow) 
 Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight) 
 (And you'll be so full of sorrow) 
 Uhh uhh (you'll go tell all your friends) 
 Tell your friends (how you called and I followed) 
 How you followed me (but you won't see me tonight) 
 Not tonight baby (no, you won't see me tomorrow) 
 C'mon, c'mon c'mon 
 Tomorrow, what 
 Daylight, ghost 
  
 [Outro: Timbaland (Aaliyah)]

 You won't see Timbaland tonight baby

 [Intro] 
 And as a special treat this evening 
 I have asked America's foremost young poet 
 To read his latest poem for us 
  
 [Scratching by DJ Premier] 
 "Ladies and gentlemen.." 
 "Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus" 
 "Everybody watch him" 
 "Ladies and gentlemen.." 
 "Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus" 
 "We-we-we came a long way" 
 "Ladies and gentlemen.." 
 "Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus" 
 "Everybody watch him" 
 "Ladies and gentlemen.." 
 "Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"* 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo.. 
 Yo.. yo.. 
 Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes 
 Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine? 
 My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards 
 For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers 
 I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man 
 That's "Godfather" shit, back seat, next lit plans 
 Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with 
 And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick 
 Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings 
 Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing 
 Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray 
 With stains of blood and germ and piss all day 
 Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised 
 Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way 
 Niggas with names, living off reputation 
 Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing 
  
 [Scratching by DJ Premier] 
 "Ladies and gentlemen.." 
 "Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus" 
 "Everybody watch him"} 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love we can take it there 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down? 
 If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt 
 Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds 
 Dick rings for your chicklings 
 Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about 
 Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South 
 And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i 
 Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye? 
 Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me? 
 You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me 
 Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three 
 Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D 
 Can't find a nigga shook from Queens 
 I'll be with the most grimy killers 
 (what nigga) and they all look clean 
 Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start 
 Your next stop is to the graveyard 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love we can take it there 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft 
 You talk but you scared to go back up North 
 Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing 
 Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting 
 You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again 
 Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn 
 Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore 
 Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor 
 So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line 
 I got nines, every color shape and design 
 I sent killers every race to put one in your spine 
 Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear? 
 Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying 
 I think like you do, roll with about two irons 
 Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining 
 - and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass 
 The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds 
 While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom 
 With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases 
 Full of paper, not money it's bank statements 
 The Illmatic that explains how we rock 
 Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared 
 If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running 
 If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning 
 Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared 
 It's all fair in love we can take it there

 {"Hydro Drops" weed skit follows}[Intro: Mykel] 
 Where there's life there is water 
 We depend on Mama Nature 
 There's a message for tomorrow 
 Everything connects to you 
 Some say soon it will be over 
 You can see it in the weather 
 Out of tune with Mama Nature 
 What you do comes back to you 
  
 [Chorus: Mykel] 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uhh, uhh 
 Confucius, Confucius, Sigmund Freud 
 And Farad Muhammad, is it evolution or God? 
 Searching for the truth is a threat 
 Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds 
 Come out to silence you, my house in Malibu probably tapped 
 Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black 
 Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily 
 Patriot Act never scared me 
 Jake in the Taurus, sticky in the jar-as 
 Niggas I'm with got warrants 
 America's browning, 20 years from now every town'll be brown and Latin 
 An African looking Manhattan 
 I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes 
 Word to me, not a hoax back in '99 
 A spacecraft in the skyline 
 In L.A. in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying 
  
 [Bridge 1: Mykel] 
 Every mother every father 
 Raise your sons and your daughters 
 With respect and with honor 
 From the seed comes a fruit 
 It's an unbroken circle 
 All of life is universal 
 And we're all in the struggle 
 If I know one thing is true 
  
 [Chorus: Mykel] 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Evidence remains in debate 
 Documents of our own Air Force base 
 Additional terrestrial information 
 Other planets with life population, my observation 
 Scientists study pictures of a flying disk 
 Right on earth anthropologists are finding shit 
 Visitors probably live with us, they can mimic us 
 It's sort of what we're seeing in the cinemas 
  
 [Bridge 2: Mykel] 
 Take a look in the mirror 
 And see the bigger picture 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 Nobody is an island 
 We are part of an environment 
 Only way we're gon' survive 
 Is if we harmonize 
  
 [Chorus: Mykel] 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Reginald Lewis, the black billionaire 
 Before Oprah, Bob Johnson, how'd he disappear? 
 Conspiracy theories, UFOs in the air 
 I've seen it with my own two eyes, and I swear 
 Like Warren Buffet, real money I'm just trying to touch it 
 The diamond encrusted shit, live illustrious 
 Cause we was deprived of it, suffered 
 Now we pop to prove anything's possible 
 My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us 
 Now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up 
 Just when niggas 'bout to see they cut 
 Global warming about to burn us up 
 Niggas never really seen paper in this world 
 American blacks, the teenager of this world 
 Give us 20 more years to grow up, already geniuses 
 What I mean is this 
 I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer 
 'Til I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima 
 He inserted something in me that made me feel worthier 
 Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter 
  
 [Bridge 2: Mykel] 
 Take a look in the mirror 
 And see the bigger picture 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 Nobody is an island 
 We are part of an environment 
 Only way we're gon' survive 
 Is if we harmonize 
  
 [Chorus: Mykel] 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Ayo I'm American born, love america, love my people, love all mankind, all nationalities you know 
 I think it's just recently where everybody just started to feel like there was an elite group that runs everything, and everybody else was sheep, ignorant, making all ethnicities, colors and creeds, niggers, blind to what really is going on 
 So I say take off the wool from your eyes 
 Out with the old America in with the new 
 End all racism, all injustice, all oppression to poor people, any people anywhere in this planet 
 Let's come together: a new day is rising[Intro: Scarface] 
 Yo Nas 
 I don't think they wanna fuck with this 
 Gangsta shit, fo' sho' 
 Danger, danger 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 1: Scarface] 
 It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough 
 Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched 
 Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally 
 Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot 
 They ain't ready for the Nakamici 
 I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci 
 Now dey a motherfuckin' see me 
 They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York 
 Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee 
 Game over, he with my man came over 
 To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover 
 Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for 
 Tell these niggas why we here 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection 
 Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected 
 Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke 
 Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke 
 Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me 
 That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me 
 I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian 
 Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain 
 My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas 
 Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas 
 Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business 
 Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what? 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it 
  
 [Verse 3: Scarface] 
 You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at 
 So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap 
 Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information 
 Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back 
 Cause when it come down to the come down; 
 I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him 
 Walk up to his face and then gone 
 Set a example, send these hoes a little message: 
 They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it 
 Leaded, I pull these capers all the time 
 With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind 
 Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, "Let's go" 
 And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die 
 He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood 
 With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug 
 I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here 
 Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it 
  
 [Verse 4: Nas] 
 A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose 
 To his wake we send a wreath that explodes 
 Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed 
 That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe 
 Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes 
 Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti 
 I share withcha drama, you share with mine 
 That's how we killin' two birds at the same time 
 Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger 
 With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga 
 Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war 
 Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw 
 Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art 
 And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin' 
 Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life 
 Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) 
 I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted 
 Any nigga can get it 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 A favor for a favor 
 A favor for a favor 
 A favor for a favor[Verse 1: Nas] 
 From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we Superfly 
 Made Gucci the shit - Louie too, suits and ties 
 Player trophies, pray to Goldie 
 Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs' 
 Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit 
 Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid 
 Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets 
 Sip Moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies 
 I love y'all; pyramids to cotton fields 
 To Wrigley Fields, forgotten men who DID get killed 
 Crispus Attucks, the first blasted 
 Peace to the rich lady, purse snatcher shot in the back 
 I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad 
 Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad 
 Minstrel shows; from gold to shackles and back to gold 
 We act like we home, matter of fact - we are home 
 Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones 
 Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones 
 Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag 
 Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass! 
  
 [Interlude: Eban Thomas] 
 As James Baldwin says,"You can only be destroyed 
 By believing that you really are 
 What the white world considers - a nigga" {*echoes*} 
  
 [Chorus: sung w/ ad-libs] 
 No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow... 
 No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow... 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Can't be stopped 
 Yo, on Dateline, the other night they showed hate crimes 
 Gave a blood time cause he fought with his canine 
 Bestiality, humane society 
 Go to China, see how they dine, see what they eat 
 Better yet ask PETA, whoever; which animal makes suede? 
 If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages? 
 Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians 
 Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir 
 David Star on the chain of Sammy Davis 
 He helped pave the way for Southern Crankers and them Harlem Shakers 
 Now we gettin' our papers, they try to censor the words 
 And stop our money comin', but you can't escape us - haters 
  
 [Chorus: sung w/ ad-libs] 
 No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow... 
 No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow...[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Yeah, laced and Macy's, don't have it, a hatred addict 
 I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric 
 I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth 
 So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing 
 Women dream I'm your husband 
 I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting 
 I started bling, how could you question my direction 
 Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-stepping 
 You hate me, should thank me, but lately 
 I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry 
 I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder 
 Your best success is my worst blunder 
 Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi 
 Vivienne Westwood, I'm good 
 Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood 
 Dre & Cool, we riding heavy, NY to Miami 'cause... 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas] 
 We make the world go round 
 Now let's toast to the hustlers 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers 
 We make the world go round 
 And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us 
 We make the world go round 
  
 [Verse 2: The Game & Chris Brown] 
 I see the haters on the floor jocking my swag 
 I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags and pouring champagne inside a polo glass 
 Model bitches rolling grass, Escobar unfolding cash 
 Toasting with my entourage, went from robbing armored cars 
 To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage 
 We throwing red dice at the Mirage 
 I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage 
 Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad 
 (We The Best!) Big pimping, top down chrome spinning 
 Top Gun, Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen 
 No [censored], just Romo 
 You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo 
 Jessica Simpson, that's so-so 
 Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso 
 Tell Hawaii Five-O to catch me at the Pro Bowl 
 On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my Polo... 
 CB, let 'em know though 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas] 
 We make the world go round 
 Now let's toast to the hustlers 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers 
 We make the world go round 
 And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us 
 We make the world go round 
  
 [Bridge: Chris Brown] 
 We make the world go round 
 From my town to your town 
 We on top, no stopping us now 
 We got Patron, the ballers two stepping 
 Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping 
 From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping 
 (From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping) 
 So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 We start with Bellini's and end with Patrón shots 
 H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart 
 Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags 
 Worth a hundred cash shopping 
 Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up 
 Prefer peach Schnaps, Perrier-Jouët, a vanilla dutch 
 Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that 
 300 carats the average up on the neck, black 
 Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss 
 Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche 
 Top down, new fashion 
 Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light flashing 
 And I'm laughing, my plaques' from album sales 
 Y'all is ringtone platinum, but ninety-nine cents adds up 
 I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em 
 The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track 
 What! 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas] 
 Now let's toast to the hustlers 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas 
 We make the world go round 
 Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers 
 We make the world go round 
 And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us 
 We make the world go round[Produced by Large Professor] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin 
 To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them 
 Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees 
 Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw 
 Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that 
 Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black 
 I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote 
 It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package 
 And they was into dope back then 
 Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin 
 But it's small change compare to hip hoppin 
 And did I mention millions because of lip poppin 
 Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin 
 Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one 
 It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin 
 But all this time it's like organized crimin 
 For instance, there was a time when there was a line 
 Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in 
 The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper 
 Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya 
 The government watchin all of those who thuggin it 
 They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it 
 Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass 
 The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars 
  
 [Hook] 
 We call it Star Wars 
 What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars 
 We call it Star Wars 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken 
 Catfish no snails simple nigga to please 
 Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks 
 She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace 
 Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought 
 Niggas was raised off the shit I record 
 Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock 
 Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams 
 Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness 
 Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms 
 With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built 
 It's nothin mother had a motherfucker 
 I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip 
 That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects 
 Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot yes 
 Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris 
 Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew 
 Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too 
 Ain't enough room in this town 
 What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars 
  
 [Hook] 
 Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars 
 Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police 
 Not what you read in tabloid seats 
 These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it 
 Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it 
 Came from the streets we the voice of the youth 
 America's nightmare was given a mic booth 
 Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars 
 Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs 
 Entertainment, this is our world this is our language 
 Different regions speakin east and west gang shit 
 You got your positive shit like, Common Sense 
 But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube 
 Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules 
 What you think is different from the block whenever we feud 
 Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs 
 Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that 
 Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe 
 To run in your release party sprayin the place 
 Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door 
 Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store 
 Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you 
 You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you 
 Next mornin every news channel and front page 
 Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars[Sample] 
 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan 
 They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership 
 But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline 
 His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life 
 Louis Farrakhan" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, yeah, wow.. 
 No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told 
 You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
 Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me 
 I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name 
 I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came 
 'Cause I stood in the face of damnation 
 Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em 
 He want my blood, why me? 
 Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man? 
 Fuck it, I'll take one 
 'Cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them 
 They believe in reparation makes it even 
 So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening 
 In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland 
 We getting it in son 
 Another bullet pass by, missed me 
 Wondering who plotting to get me? 
 Alphabet boys still plotting against me 
 To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history 
 You won't remember why they came to clip me 
 When time go by you'll soon forget me 
 They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys 
 Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty 
 Don't let 'em kill me... 
  
 [Sample] 
 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan." 
 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan." 
 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan." 
 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan." 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some revolutionaries do live long 
 Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time 
 Everybody has rights, can I use mine? 
 Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine? 
 Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine? 
 Every time I turn around somebody new dying 
 Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot, Escobar 
 Invest my millions 
 Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children 
 Knowing that they coming anytime 
 But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me 
 Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci 
 Giving you this crack like Pookie 
 To question the system, be the resistance 
 No matter what color you are, everybody niggers 
 Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told 
 You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
 Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me 
 Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told 
 You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
 Oh, it's just a matter of days before they try to take me...[Intro: Nas] 
 American born, American raised, American made 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus 
 The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled 
 The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso 
 On the streets I was invincible 
 Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew 
 What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer 
 Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me 
 All in front of my friends 
 In the street smile with no teeth 
 I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy 
 Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3 
 Why didn't my folks just die in this society 
 Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me 
 Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat 
 Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me 
 I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father 
 Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers 
 Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high 
 It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
  
 [Verse 2: Millennium Thug] 
 It is I that step up 
 Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier 
 Hummers and Range's through the desert 
 Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water 
 Troopers lookin' for manslaughter 
 I gotta get back, for what they owe 
 Shoot 'em in the back for the get back 
 Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag 
 Forget the life had, now we all rebels 
 Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto 
 We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble 
 And debris from the earth as we knew crumble 
 Yo you could see the sea 
 And the stars look closer to me 
 I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max 
 S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap 
 My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but yo 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas (Millennium Thug)] 
 Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls 
 I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God 
 Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape 
 Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape 
 How is the war 
 And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes 
 Holdin' machine guns 
 Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on 
 Anywhere is better than this 
 It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit 
 Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares 
 I know the warden is readin' the scribe 
 (But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business) 
 Courts, lawyers and jails 
 We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel 
  
 [Verse 4: Millennium Thug] 
 There's not a bitch in sight 
 Or block bench, or black gate 
 Or gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President 
 I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent 
 Now it's state of the art 
 I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart 
 What a bloody mess, a slug fest 
 I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin' 
 You know I'm spittin' mine 
 I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win 
 Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in 
 I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head 
 Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back 
 Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass 
 I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake 
 Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape 
 And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
 My country shitted on me (my country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (naw, never) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we know too much) 
 'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much) 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 This goes out to Che Guevara; 
 A Revolutionary destroyed by his country 
 Just trying to fight for what's real 
 This goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz 
 Just trying to fight for what's real 
 This goes out to Martin, all about peace and destroyed by his own country 
 This goes out to everybody in the whole world 
 Just trying to fight for what's real 
 To Patrice Lumumba; 
 Just trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people 
 This goes out to my hood niggas 
 Coming up everyday just trying to survive the only way we know how 
 But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now 
 So ain't nothing gon' to stop us now 
 To my country, to my country, my country, my country...[Produced by Kanye West & Mad Rapper] 
  
 [Intro] 
 To my nigga 
 Who brought me in this world 
 Ha, that's right nigga 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God 
 My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us 
 My pops maybe was late but always came home 
 My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on 
 Soon as he walk in the door she barking 
 I turned down the Johnny Carson 
 Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs 
 Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother 
 Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other 
 My poppa played the street all day, mama was either home 
 Or at work, while we played inside the hall way 
 She sacrifices all she got to feed us 
 When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated 
 But still I didn't see it, mama hid it from us 
 We was kids younger, 'til we got bigger, on to 
 Bigger things that we knew what the time was 
 That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa 
 Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of 
 The pretty brown round, running round town 
 "(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down" 
 Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa 
 Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of 
 The pretty brown round, running round town 
 "(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 So many kids I knew, never knew who pop was 
 That's why I show my pop love 
 He was still around when I popped up 
 He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death 
 But stayed, watched me crawl 'til I took my first step 
 To the first grade, to my first fistfight 
 Right behind me he would stand 
 No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man 
 Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam 
 He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam 
 Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing 
 Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him 
 "What's this white shit on that plate and your face? 
 And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist 
 And, who's this lady I'm facing? 
 Dark skin, you're not my mommy!" 
 He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me 
 Promise me things that he would buy me 
 If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell mommy 
 He said one day I'll understand, "Little me 
 What's in you is inside me" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa 
 Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of 
 The pretty brown round, running round town 
 "(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down" 
 Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa 
 Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of 
 The pretty brown round, running round town 
 "(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Uhh, my nigga 
 Pops told me hold my own 
 Pops told me value home 
 Could I help it poppa was a rolling stone? 
 Who loved the pretty brown round, outta town bound 
 Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring 
 At home I play his latest recordings 
 And it's strange now how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now 
 Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power 
 From weed habits are the same now 
 No white lines, no trumpets, just tight rhymes 
 And beats that be pumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something 
 A child's young years the most important time to be there 
 That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here 
 I'm older now, see what having a father's about 
 One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out 
 It's not because of you, you know the deal 
 Him and your moms feel 
 If they stay together then someone will get killed 
 I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga 
 Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you kid 
 Life goes on...[Produced by The Alchemist] 
  
 [Intro: Nas & (Lake)] 
 (Uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!) 
 Uh, ghetto children singing (singing, what up?) 
 See they eager to learn (uh hum) 
 How to become the next world leaders, Bravehearts 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques 
 Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness 
 In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary 
 Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal 
 Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time 
 When Aryan nations ain't having integration 
 We so blind, the beauty of life 
 Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ 
 I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right 
 "Jesus", what is he like? 
 I picture him standing with diamonds on him 
 Little different from the way my mommy saw him 
 Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and 
 Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging 
 Splitting dutches up, strap up 
 The armies is school teaching smart ways to kill 
 I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool, the chronic's a fool 
 Got me thinking out loud, fuck it 
 Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
  
 [Verse 2: Lake] 
 My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's 
 I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills 
 For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come 
 I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus 
 Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese 
 And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 
 Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa 
 50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters 
 My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions 
 I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system 
 I'm like a modern day Hitler 
 Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga 
 Only killers know my face 
 I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake 
 Though simultaneously the street revolution 
 21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas & Lake] 
 Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers 
 Protect the children, grab revolvers 
 The women plays important part of our life force 
 So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war 
 Uh, and listen more and talk less 
 Watch all and trust none, demand your respect 
 And be ready to die for what you believe in 
 And ride all the time not just when convenient 
 Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding 
 We the lost children of Israel in this western world region 
 You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in 
 Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong 
 It's more to a war than just getting it on 
 Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared 
 I don't care if no one's spared in.. 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here 
 Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war 
 For the cause, I gotta take you off here[Produced by Salaam Remi] 
  
 [Intro: Jadakiss] 
 I need it from the top, ah! 
 This is history baby 
 Commissioner Steve Stoute 
 Lenny, ha! 
 God's Son, what up? 
 D-Block, what up? 
 Bravehearts, what up? 
  
 [Verse 1: Jadakiss] 
 Yo ain't nothing but trouble, God, when I kick in the door 
 With D-Block, Bravehearts and the Double R 
 Don't make me let the machine off 
 This is methadone music that you can lean off 
 "Made You Look," the remix, with me up on it 
 I copped your shit, now I break weed up on it 
 And everything is real I see 
 Like my niggas that been home but they only got a jail ID 
 I helped the game, it ain't help me 
 I'm top five, dead or alive, and that's just off one LP 
 And I still buzz, they feel cuz 
 'Cause they know the flow's ill just like Will was 
 I'm just tryna make sure that my sons wealthy 
 Out of shape, but I make sure that my guns healthy 
 I'm a ape, you can't stand 'Kiss, comin through the hood 
 In a Aston Vanquish, the color of dandruff 
 They said we jumped him, I just let the gun snuff him 
 Copped P then turboed soon as they uncuff him 
 This goes out to all of your mans 
 Why put you in the verse when I can put you in a coroner van? 
 D-Block! 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 They shooting! Ah, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin big money, playboy your time's up 
 Where them gangsters? Where them dimes at? 
  
 [Verse 2: Ludacris] 
 I'm from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows 
 Where Xs mark spots and kitchens mark Os 
 Where love's gon' getcha and hate is gon' snitch ya 
 And fingers squeeze triggers like boa constrictors 
 It's the, Mr. Luda, Jada and Nas 
 And our bullets give you a deep-tissue massage 
 So hear a song and dance while I make these ends 
 You never stood half a chance like Siamese Twins (AH!) 
 They shooting! Look in the barrel! 
 Then he made the front page of the Miami Herald 
 Or Chi. Tribune, nozzles with silent doom 
 We in that A-Town Journal as violent goons 
 You should print my information, quote my rhymes 
 And keep me in between these New York and L.A. Times 
 I was the victim of society, it's 'Cris the Menace 
 With mo' shit out on the streets than evicted tenants, whoa! 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 They shooting! Ah, made you look 
 You a slave to a page in my rhyme book 
 Gettin big money, playboy your time's up 
 Where them gangsters? Where them dimes at? 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 Jungle! Wiz! Nashawn! 
 We got 'em scared, look! 
 We got 'em scared, they runnin'! 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Yo, I grasp the ratchet, the blinker, the biscuit, the burner 
 The heat, the toaster, the twister, you meetin your owner 
 The banger, the hammer, the flamers I aim at the cannons 
 And can ya, manhandlin ya, you'll be famous, I'll cancel you 
 And cut, that's the end of your movie 
 Pretendin you actin like you and your mens'll come shoot me 
 My tennis shoes Gucci, old school, pea-soup green 
 Jean Lee suit on, Veuve Clicquot champagne 
 Friday the 13th my CD drop 
 I rhyme to more Base than EZ Rock, I'm Jason, call up P.D 
 Watch hem Bravehearts, Jungle and Wiz and Nashawn 
 Ill Will rasta Lake, never revealin his face on 
 TV or pictures or even them niggas 
 Sorry that I made you wait long, glad them fakes gone 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 We shooting! Squeezing them triggers with Luda beside me 
 Me and 'Kiss get Luniz of weed, set to Styles P 
 Tell him hold his head, God's Son got him we made y'all look 
 From San Quentin to Rikers Island to Green, Sing Sing...[Verse 1] 
 Amazing man, got a letter from an Asian fan 
 He asked, "was I black, was I gon' play Japan soon?" 
 Wrote back, "Yes" danced in the shower, got dressed 
 Old school, powdered my neck 
 I give, but I'm selfish 
 Tattoo of my chick lips on my pelvis 
 Well it's the pubic part, excuse me y'all 
 I think that I became musical 
 Way before rap I did wanna be the tap dance kid 
 On Broadway, 42nd Street, legendary 
 Three-card Molly, Nasir drives a Harley now 
 FYI, for your info 
 Insects splattered on the bike window 
 Tatted innuendo 
 Just last night, don't know where it came from 
 Guess it's from a past life 
 Am I charismatic enough? 
 Does my charm reach people that could make a change? 
 If I shoot with straight aim at the positive target 
 And swooed 'em to make a deposit into my account 
 Would that be progress? 
 I doubt 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Something is fishy, something is bothering me 
 I just can't figure it out 
 Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it 
 Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out 
 Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know 
 Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated 
 Cause now I'm focusing too hard 
 On something that's just too plain to see 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Savoir faire yeah radiate, conscience clear 
 About to have a monstrous year 
 Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep 
 Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth 
 C'est la vie, I'm engaged 
 But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me 
 And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue 
 That was put there by the squad 
 Look here, I'm the God on the mic on the track 
 Like Arthur Ashe with a tennis rack, tell the DJ, spin it back 
 {*beat reverses*} 
 Yeah, somethin' like that 
 Uh, it go 
 Savoir-faire yeah, radiate, conscience clear 
 About to have a monstrous year 
 Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep 
 Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth 
 C'est la vie, I'm engaged 
 But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me 
 And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue 
 They were all put there by the squad 
 Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track 
 Like Arthur Ash on the tennis rack, tell the, nah 
 Everything I be in 
 Creme de la creme from the linen to the gold front rim 
 Cold stuntin' 
 Take a look around, what you found? 
 Like Master Ace, tell me the world's a faster place 
 High school students will slash your face 
 And these white nigga hoods, I'm talkin' 
 Computer rage is real 
 Get excited when I'm walkin' 
 Cause I'm used to dark shades and a limousine tint 
 Business managers scare me half to death 
 When they tell me every month what is (?) being spent 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Something is fishy, something is bothering me 
 I just can't figure it out 
 Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it 
 Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out 
 Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know 
 Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated 
 Cause now I'm focusing too hard 
 On something that's just too plain to see 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I don't like when my girl try to pull a MC Lyte 
 Jumped out the whip, through the train 
 Leave me like D Nice 
 They say we used to resemble each other 
 Both last name Jones so we must be brothers 
 My yearly salary suffers 
 Cause I hate work, no play make Jack lame 
 And I rock parts on my head that are hotter than yours 
 Hot rosado lines, designs your barber can't draw 
 Posters of Nas on the barbershop doors 
 Entourage, security galore 
 When was the last time you rode by yourself, superstar? 
 Got so much love I shot Cupid in the heart 
 I'm awakened by my own screams 
 Lucifer masturbated in my dreams 
 It means somebody is gonna get fucked in the worst way 
 And none of y'all hoes touchin' my wordplay 
 Janitors and men with eighty mil both feel the same grief 
 The men at work, blue collars of the old men 
 Shinin' shoes, shoe polish go through the same dramas 
 They wish for a better tomorrow 
 I thought only five percenters are conspiracy theorists 
 Thinkin' what the new world order thing is 
 But everybody does 
 The fear of the planet is contaminatin everybody's blood 
 Triliteral, Democratic parties 
 Anglo-American military alliance 
 Study at Oxford, scholars, they watchin' 
 NASDAQ, Dow Jones, got the world stocks in a shamble 
 Procter and Gamble 
 Toxins demand you understand who plans to jam you 
 Some random thoughts by the candlelight in Paris 
 As I struggle to be savvy 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Something is fishy, something is bothering me 
 I just can't figure it out 
 Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it 
 Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out 
 Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know 
 Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated 
 Cause now I'm focusing too hard 
 On something that's just too plain to see[Verse 1] 
 My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fully's 
 Brrrat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel 
 Rats get their tails snapped and trapped 
 The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap 
 Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya 
 Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria 
 Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors 
 Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall 
 I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers 
 Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up 
 Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up 
 Even if they indicted Jacob 
 Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off 
 Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough 
 They die and hit Hell from an iron 
 I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit 
 Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist 
 They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit 
 Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out 
 You a kid, you don't live what you rap about 
 King poetic, too many haters to count 
 Too much paper to count, QB, bitch! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha) 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet 
 Thinking about which nigga to target 
 You kill a nigga today, he lives forever 
 So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs 
 Black TEC on the table, Mag .44 
 Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door 
 Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar 
 You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade 
 Niggas, it's fifty ways to dissect the General 
 If I give ya the top five, you will not survive 
 Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue 
 Rule 2: thought you knew don't fuck with God's Son 
 Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait 
 If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive 
 Each one of you guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive 
 Like y'all ain't in agreement with Nas 
 That shit is dead motherfucker, it's dead, bitch… 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha) 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers 
 And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses 
 Laced in riches, cake ridiculous 
 From nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds 
 Vegas, places in Switzerland 
 From non-blastin' to auto, I don't have to blast mine 
 They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb 
 Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases 
 Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is 
 'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you 
 Only if they grind with you or slang for ya 
 Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner 
 Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable 
 Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl 
 Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rollie, y'all 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha) 
 Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
 Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

 These are last words of a hanging slave 
 How could I forget this 
 I rob you, put you on my hit list 
 Under my nails are dirty look at the grime 
 My burnt lips from the roach clips 
 How can I shine 
 Being broke and bag a dope bitch 
 Powerful minds, we brave men 
 I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

 I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone 
 Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones 
 Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan 
 Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on 
 Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on 
 It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm 
 I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin' 
 Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave 
 Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed 
 First rapper to shoot off stage 
 Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book 
 A twenty four hour song without no hook 
 Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug 
 Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug 
 Thugs around me outside its grimy outside 
 Better slide before you get bodied outside

 I'ma prison cell six by nine 
 Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail 
 My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house 
 I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out 
 I take the sun away put misery instead 
 When you with me most folks consider you dead 
 I saw too many inmates fallin' apart 
 Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark 
 Convicts think they alone but if they listen close 
 They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse 
 All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin 
 I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin') 
 I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter 
 If the court parole ya then another con enters 
 No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often 
 When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin 
 Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep 
 Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me 
 Face to face with a cage no matter your age 
 I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage 
 Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out 
 'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about 
 Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman 
 And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin' 
 Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you 
 You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

 Cause they said they played they parts well 
 Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail 
 Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel 
 Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well" 
 Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro? 
 The acceptable Negro -- hell nah 
 But they say, "These are our heroes" 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play 
 Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud 
 But there's somethin' they don't say 
 Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay 
 From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe 
 First he played his life cool just like Michael 
 Now he rock ice too just like I do 
 Yo, you can't do better than that? 
 The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat? 
 Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back 
 Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you 
 You turn around then you shit on Shaq 
 Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes 
 He love a little butt crack, got enough cash 
 Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you 
 To do something for the youth, stupid spoof 
 But you let them use you as an example 
 They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles 
 But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through 
 But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black 
 But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque 
 You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface 
 You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe 
 Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it 
 Huh, and in the end we all got dicked 
 These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot 
 Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks 
 Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout 
 Tavis Smiley , Michael Eric Dyson 
 Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them 
 Nicky Giovanni poetical black female 
 Jim Brown to the people who sing well from 
 Fela to Miriam Makeba 
 The mirror says you are the next American leader 
 So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records 
 These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records 
 Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC 
 But next year, who knows what we'll see? 
 Ha-Ha, these are our heroes 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Nas: "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know 
 The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard 
 Big up to Tiger Woods . Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up 
 To Cuba Gooding Jr . Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs 
 What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit 
 And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit." 
  
 Male Heckler: "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though 
 Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at 
 All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in 
 My hood. What type of shit is that?" 
  
 *overlapping dialogue* 
  
 Nas: "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please 
 Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I 
 Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha 
 Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE." 
  
 Thug Heckler: "Come on nigga, give back to the hood. Cocky 
 Motherfucker!"[Intro: Nas] 
 Yo, Ill Will, Ruff Ryders 
 What what, straight like that 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer 
 Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga 
 A weed head, a coke sniffer 
 You rich or a broke nigga 
 Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas 
 Lots of my mans trapped up in a max 
 Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back 
 That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out 
 Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House 
 My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted 
 Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit 
 Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day 
 So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay 
 Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar 
 Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya 
 Can't believe how my life changed 
 From the hood, the first time in my life 
 I can say I did the right thing 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (DMX)] 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh) 
  
 [Verse 2: DMX] 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
 Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what) 
 So I keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna test (uh) 
 I got no time for games 'cause I'm all grown up 
 You wanna joke nigga? Laugh when you get blown up (come on) 
 See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father 
 Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real) 
 Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what) 
 Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on) 
 Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit 
 Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit 
 Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light 
 Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night 
 Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh) 
 Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit 
 So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this 
 Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh) 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (DMX)] 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Make history before you go 
 Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough 
 Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?) 
 Time is valuable 
 Low and behold the young, black, and powerful 
 Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow 
 You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow 
 Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried 
 That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit 
 Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness 
 If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish 
 Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it 
 Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit 
 Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best 
 Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth 
 No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first 
 Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (DMX)] 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh) 
 Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it 
 No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)[Intro] 
 Yeah, check check, testing 
 It's clear out there, yeah 
 It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha 
 Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Check, let there be light 
 No gang bangin' in New York tonight 
 Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life 
 Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right 
 What's all this talk that Nas got bought? 
 I'd rather outline my body in white chalk 
 Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still 
 This is all overseen by my man Will 
  
 [Hook: Tre Williams] 
 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I know that I ain't got much time left 
 And they don't really wanna see the good in me 
 Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me 
 And I know my business, so my sins great 
 And I thank the hood for all the love they gave 
 And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate 
 Oh, let there be light! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture 
 There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers 
 Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen 
 Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, and 
 It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned 
 They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin 
 If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises 
 And bring back the niggas who was livest 
 Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days 
 They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage 
 Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave 
 They used to love us 
 Till we found our own way through the maze 
 New York, set trippin' and flaggin' 
 Got the West Coast laughin' 
 Now Esco's askin', "What happened?" 
 My homegirl from upper Manhattan; she remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lot of rat-a-tat-tattin' 
  
 [Hook: Tre Williams] 
 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I know that I ain't got much time left 
 And they don't really wanna see the good in me 
 Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me 
 And I know my business, so my sins great 
 And I thank the hood for all the love they gave 
 And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate 
 Oh, let there be light! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The son of the audio cassette era, TEC wearer 
 Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror 
 Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red 
 Like that horse standing on it's hind legs 
 Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds 
 I wanted bread like Wonder 
 Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel 
 Nas is the Ghetto American Idol 
 No matter what you do you're never getting my title 
 I can't sound smart, ‘cause y'all will run away 
 They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay 
 Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler 
 Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ 
 When you're four years into the game 
 We can have a conversation 
 Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation 
 Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame 
 Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas 
  
 [Bridge: Nas + (Tre Williams)] 
 [And I] Right about now [And I] (They don't really know) 
 [And I] (They don't really see) 
 I don't even deal with all that garbage 
 (No, no, no) We getting real right, you know? 
 [And I] (Though I walk through the valley) 
 That is Tre Williams, ladies and gentlemen 
 [And I] (They should fear no) [And I] (no, no-oh) 
 Focus on good things, man, good times, heh-heh, alright 
  
 [Hook: Tre Williams] 
 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

 Oh let it be, let it be, yeah 
 Let it be, let it be[Verse 1: Nas] 
 I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds 
 Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads 
 Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman 
 Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed 
 The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit 
 Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount 
 Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale 
 Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk 
 War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say 
 May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away 
 At our enemies, may they die easily 
 Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me 
 Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things 
 Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans 
 Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts 
 On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed 
 And they're aware of us though 
 And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though 
 Stayin' on my hus-tle 
  
 *beat change* 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 A message to those who trapped us up 
 From federal guys who backed them up 
 We never will die, we black and tough 
 Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust 
 Half of us been locked up inside the beast 
 Look at the time we see 
 Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens 
 Even the Congo needs dreams 
 Our bullets and triggers our enemies 
 Pullin' on innocent women and children 
 It wasn't no ghetto killers 
 Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings 
 But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon' 
 Just stand and watch you die 
 I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand 
 Come on let's ride 
 A message to those who killed the king 
 Who murdered the Christ, the same regime 
 What God has built you never can break 
 What God has loved you never can hate 
 Man makes rules and laws 
 You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting 
 You devils will run back into the caves you came from 
 Whenever that day comes, forty-acres 
 Plantations, see every race won 
 Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations[Intro] 
 Uhh.. regulate nigga 
 Bravehearts nigga 
 Live for this 
 Some of y'all don't live at all 
 Get yours nigga 
 Get yours baby 
 Uhh, yo.. yo.. 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings 
 Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings 
 With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista 
 From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S 
 About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move 
 A lot of rules, some locked in solitude 
 Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised? 
 The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah 
 I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds 
 My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees 
 May the children come in all colors, change like leaves 
 But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs 
 With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me 
 Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines 
 Light on those, innocent to how the world grows 
 Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes 
 And you accounted for, everything that you heard 
 Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words 
 My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners.. 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings 
 Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators 
 Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered 
 Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation? 
 One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation 
 Empty arguments and real conversations needed 
 The world'll need it, to hear it 
 Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb 
 This hurt come from the honest word 
 I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned 
 Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it 
 Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it 
 Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded 
 To sink in the Atlantic 
 Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but 
 Who decides when and if your life is finished? 
 If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord 
 May we break away from the chains abroad 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners.. 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes 
 I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is 
 Time waits for none of you, in fact 
 He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you 
 Small visions of better life if cheddar was right 
 Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time 
 Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin' 
 Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin' 
 Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play 
 Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes 
 In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A 
 Around the way where we from 
 Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young 
 Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past 
 And a newborn's, first time to be here at last 
 And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain 
 Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came 
 Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers 
 Readin' history, but who's the authors? 
 For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder 
 But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter 
 Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners.. 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise 
 Ghetto prisoners..[Verse 1: Nas] 
 The phone rings 
 Another peaceful moment is lost 
 Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off 
 I press pause in the bed as a king 
 I let it ring 4 or 5 times 
 Answer while I'm puffin' my green 
 It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas" 
 I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that 
 She offered me dinner under the moon 
 I said, "Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room" 
 Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up 
 The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila 
 Put on my Lee's and the original Filas 
 Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels 
 Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose 
 Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go 
 Heads turn it's a freak show 
 I need them to know, when will they learn 
 Nas need a queen not a ho to 
 Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me 
 But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy 
 Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies 
 And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy 
  
 [Chorus: Claudette Ortiz] 
 Hey Nas, how ya doin'? 
 Take my name, and my number 
 Meanwhile, we'll be groovin' 
 But let's take, it, slow 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 One for the honies who roll blunts up but don't smoke 
 Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke 
 Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you 
 Double life wife, play with the man that's livin' with you 
 Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin' 
 Get to a man's heart through his stomach 
 You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts 
 Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark 
 Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart 
 Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart 
 If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok 
 If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak 
 'Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me 
 But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy 
 A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies 
 And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy 
  
 [Chorus: Kelis] 
 Hey Nas, how ya doin'? 
 Take my name, and my number 
 Meanwhile, we'll be groovin' 
 But let's take, it, slow 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Slow is the way 
 Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys 
 Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me 
 That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there 
 Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years 
 Like no one else in the world did this except for us two 
 You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you 
 If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo 
 You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you 
 Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin' 
 As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission 
 Time's out forbidden 
 Until we pass out, that's when we stop 
 We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot 
 Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock 
 Give it all we got, give it all we got 
 You 'bout the baddest thing 
 Since Michael had Billie Jean 
 And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls 
 But to be my queen you must... 
 Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me 
 But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy 
 Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies 
 And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy 
  
 [Chorus: Claudette Ortiz & Kelis] 
 Hey Nas, how ya doin'? 
 Take my name, and my number 
 Meanwhile, we'll be groovin' 
 But let's take, it, slow 
  
 [Outro: Claudette Ortiz]

 Haha, well, here I am, yep, I'm the man

 [Verse 2: Ludacris &  Doug E. Fresh] 
 Now I was, so fresh and so fly in diamonds 
 When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin' 
 Little cute thing, said, "What's yo' name?" 
 I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain (woo!) 
 Ooh-ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up 
 BLAOW! Ludacris in the how-oooh-ouse! 
 The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song 
 All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh-on (ugh!) 
 Live forever like 'Fame,' let the Leroys dance 
 While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance (c'mon!) 
 Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin' (yeah) 
 But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options (woo!) 
 But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track 
 Make 'em swip-swap; Nasty N-A-S, pass that 
 Honey in the black cause I'm feelin' her curves 
 He looked down at what I had and said, "W-w-word" (ugh!) 
 Why only serve one when we can serve up two?

 So let's go (let's go), let's go (for the beat) 
 Let's go (Virgo crew), it's the Virgo 
 Let's go (Nasty Nas), let's go (Ludacris) 
 And if you don't know, now you know (Doug Fresh!)[Intro: sample] 
 We use the word everyday 
 Now we don't know the capacity of this word 
 Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir) 
 Because we did not break down the capacity 
 Of the same what (the same word) 
 Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness 
 We've been taught wrong 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door 
 It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore 
 We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw 
 The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more 
 Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders 
 But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater 
 A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back 
 To be a Forture 500 CEO it took rap 
 So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back? 
 The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack 
 Marketing companies is hiring blacks 
 Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads 
 Controversy surrounds who could say it and when 
 Some niggas are full time, some playing pretend 
 So fuck that, no apologies on the issue 
 If it offends you it's meant to, it's that simple 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Trying to erase me from y'all memory 
 Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!) 
 Speak my name and breathe life in me 
 Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!) 
 'Cause y'all use my name so reckless 
 Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!) 
 And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public 
 And I'm the subject 
 'Cause y'all my niggas 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, I was thinking a little bit 
 What would it take to authenticate my nigganess? 
 Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership? 
 Aww, that's some nigga shit 
 We only out for our own benefit? 
 We havin' too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients? 
 The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit 
 Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with 
 Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons 
 Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning 
 Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life 
 If you fight they just give in, people used to do sit ins 
 They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries 
 Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly 
 The problem is we started thinking like the colonists 
 'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Trying to erase me from y'all memory 
 Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!) 
 Speak my name and breathe life in me 
 Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!) 
 'Cause y'all use my name so reckless 
 Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!) 
 And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public 
 And I'm the subject 
 'Cause y'all my niggas 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor 
 When it came to getting paper who the hell was gonna train us? 
 Oppresion couldn't escape us through the ages 
 We changed the basis of derogatory phrases 
 And I say it's quite amazing 
 The use of ghetto terms developed our own language 
 No matter where it came from 
 It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one 
  
 [Interlude: sample] 
 Every word we use, it has a capacity 
 And if you don't understand the words you're using 
 And understand the capacity of it 
 You are using words that is creating a destiny for you 
 That you don't even know, or even conscious of 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Trying to erase me from y'all memory 
 Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!) 
 Speak my name and breathe life in me 
 Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!) 
 'Cause y'all use my name so reckless 
 Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!) 
 And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public 
 And I'm the subject 
  
 Trying to erase me from y'all memory 
 Too late, I'm engraved in history 
 Speak my name and breathe life in me 
 Make sure y'all never forget me 
 'Cause y'all use my name so reckless 
 Whether to be accepted or disrespected 
 And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public 
 And I'm the subject 
 'Cause y'all my niggas[Intro] 
 {*Kissing*} 
 I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her 
 Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her 
 I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes 
 She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold 
 Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life 
 So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife 
 And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did 
 I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big 
 She keep me jig, glorifying medallions 
 Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions 
 Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked 
 She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks 
 Bankers and diplomats 
 She the scratch on my back 
 Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act 
 When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat 
 Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped 
  
 [Chorus] 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich 
 Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money 
 Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick 
 Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket 
 It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private 
 You got me karats on my wrist 
 I'm a savage for your kiss 
 Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard 
 Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable 
 The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple 
 Don't need no pre-nup 
 'Cause when we hump we do it up 
 Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut 
 Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre 
 Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya 
 Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy 
 Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy 
 And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife 
 Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right 
 Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow 
 My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note 
  
 [Chorus] 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich 
 Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money 
 Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick 
 Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I won't sell my soul to you 
 What do I owe to you? 
 My cars, my house, my flow to you 
 Screw you, before you 
 Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you 
 The envy me cause I'm with you 
 You floss too much 
 Turn niggas out, one touch 
 For you, my guns bust 
 You always said in GOD we trust 
 It's hard enough to keep counting on you 
 You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you 
 I think I liked you better when you were illegal 
 But you had to get professional, musical 
 Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic 
 Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick 
 Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it 
 Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets 
 Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me 
 I guess bitches like you just grow on trees 
  
 [Chorus] 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich 
 Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped 
 My money, money, money, my bitch is my money 
 Ohhh money you my honey 
 Money is my bitch 
 Ohhh money, money, money 
 Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick 
 Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich[Chorus] 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 Fully grown with your hormones now 
 Got your own home and you alone 
 Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul 
 You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan 
 Your man don't wanna be around 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 She's sexy, she got it, she ride it 
 Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 I need her, I'll eat her 
 Do anything to please her 
 My ghetto queen of Sheba 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace 
 Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face 
 Sipping red wine, is it bedtime 
 You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith 
 I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay 
 Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play 
 We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice 
 Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right 
 It's your night, no stress, no fight 
 Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight 
 Never go right when you're with him 
 Try your best to forget him 
 'Cause it's easy to please me 
 CD skip when your head board hit the wall 
 Call for the lord 
 Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue 
 Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up 
 You can hit a blunt if you want 
 I'ma pull my pants up 
 We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust 
 Tell me what's the reason for us 
 To love or to fuck 
 I'm the thug that you want 
 If it's gangster we can't front 
 If you want me I can stay around 
 If you need me, I'm here for you 
 How that sound? 
 Now it's up to you 
 Depending on how you wanna get down 
 'Cause you're a big girl now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 Fully grown with your hormones now 
 Got your own home and you alone 
 Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul 
 You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan 
 Your man don't wanna be around 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 She's sexy, she got it, she ride it 
 Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 I need her, I'll eat her 
 Do anything to please her 
 My ghetto queen of Sheba 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Got your name and your number in my cell phone 
 Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone 
 If you in a good mood, if you not 
 Or you thinking bout you was at my spot 
 What we did when we got hot 
 Is you dreaming you had me? 
 Is you creaming your panties? 
 Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me 
 On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink 
 And we ate each other like candy 
 Under the covers, two intimate lovers 
 You fuck a nigga like you mad at me 
 Throw the ass to me 
 You should be glad to be 
 In the presence of a real thug as bad as me 
 While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad 
 You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard 
 How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God" 
 Every ho that you know wanna know Nas 
 Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard 
 'Cause you know how these girls are 
 Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra 
 Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions 
 Starting to get an erection 
 Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing 
 Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave 
 I need time to breathe 
 Wanna follow me, ironically 
 You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe 
 Like it's my fault 
 But you don't wanna talk 
 Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden 
 You and the shorty start scuffing 
 Now shorty dumping you out 
 Can't let her get the best of you 
 So I rescue you 
 Only thing left to do was to grab her 
 So you can jab her, get a cheap shot 
 You don't wanna feel chumped 
 Now here the cops come 
 So we gotta run to the ride 
 Then we drive off through the traffic 
 Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage 
 Looking at your face 
 And the damage in your facial 
 Every angle can't let it faze you 
 No reason to be insecure or immature 
 Baby girl, see the world is yours 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 Fully grown with your hormones now 
 Got your own home and you alone 
 Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul 
 You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan 
 Your man don't wanna be around 
 (You're a big girl now) 
 She's sexy, she got it, she ride it 
 Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh 
 (No more daddy's little girl) 
 I need her, I'll eat her 
 Do anything to please her 
 My ghetto queen of Sheba

 Fully grown with your hormones now 
 Got your own home and you alone 
 Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

 You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan 
 Your man don't wanna be around

 Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

 I need her, I'll eat her 
 Do anything to please her 
 My ghetto queen of Sheba[Intro] 
 Yeah, real conversation for that ass 
 (It's what they want) huh 
 (It's what they want) what you say? Can't hear you man 
 (It's what they want, huh) speak the fuck up 
 (It's what they want) word 
 (It's what they want) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep 
 Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip 
 Gold on my neck was once a code of respect 
 For high rollers and vets 
 Now it's loads of baguettes 
 Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC 
 No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets 
 Trees that might eject my hype back 
 Famous phrase "Nigga, light that" 
 Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?' 
 It's all about Playboys when we was young 
 Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum 
 Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's 
 Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro 
 From bottles, to seven in your hand 
 To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can 
 Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it 
 We got it if the fiends want it 
 The whole block singing the same theme "Don it" 
 Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket 
 If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it 
 You gotta love it, you gotta love it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (It's what they want) fuck it 
 (It's what they want) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want) fuck it 
 (It's what they want) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want) fuck it 
 (It's what they want) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want, huh) 
 (It's what they want) (it's what they want) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist 
 Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches 
 Hunger my riches, her childish wishes 
 Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes 
 Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough 
 Kicking this flow, slip and you fold 
 So when your click roll, I let my clips go 
 Niggas on opposite poles 
 I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole 
 Inhumane, living hostile opposed 
 To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes 
 Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor 
 Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas 
 See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference 
 Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens 
 You can't be a kingpin when you snitching 
 Regardless, we still make you a target 
 We shoot you in jail, chrome objects 
 Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics 
 This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics 
 Miserable cats, hunger paining 
 Get off your ass, stop complaining 
 My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating 
 While you home, waiting your arraignment 
 This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 
 Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me 
 They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me 
 You gotta love it, you gotta love it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (It's what they want, huh) fuck it 
 (It's what they want, huh) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want) fuck it 
 (It's what they want) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want, huh) fuck it 
 (It's what they want, huh) you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want) 
 (It's what they want) 
 (It's what they want, huh) 
 (It's what they want, huh) 
 (It's what they want)[Chorus: Havoc] 
 Yo.. 
 Dunn you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings 
 Dunn you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Unconditional love showing 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 40th side, 41st side ride 
  
 [Verse 1: Prodigy] 
 Me and my Dunns come from the slums 
 You can't take the slums out my Dunns 
 And that's how it is, that's how we live 
 Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days 
 Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say 
 I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me 
 That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty 
 We too gritty, like Sanford and Son 
 Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on 
 See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs 
 You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs 
 Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on 
 We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm 
 Silent wars or we silence the fours 
 Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho 
 Now it's movies and soundtracks 
 This is where your career stop at 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Ayo, I drink to that 
 I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me 
 You violate, they read your obituary in front your family 
 You should idolize Nas in the flesh 
 Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt 
 We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers 
 Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger 
 Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit 
 Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes 
 O.T. commute back and forth 
 Tell shorty get that package off 
 Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit 
 Caught a case then I beat the shit 
 D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets 
 Big white boys with guns yelling, "Freeze black kids!" 
 Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus 
 Wishing they was on the blocks with us 
 To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh) 
 Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it 
 Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music 
 And think deep to it, now who the truest? 
  
 [Chorus: Havoc] 
 Yo.. 
 Dunn you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings 
 Dunn you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Unconditional love showing 
 Yo.. yo you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Unconditional love showing 
 Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
  
 [Verse 3: Prodigy] 
 Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out 
 I daydream of better days, in different ways 
 Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth 
 That's why the burnt leather lean to the left 
 Even though we gained cash on fish 
 I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich 
 And I'ma be that same nigga for the door 
 And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash 
 We get stacks, you do the math 
 We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh 
 Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid 
 Rap niggas shit they drawers 
  
 [Verse 4: Nas] 
 Yo they probably did 
 I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this 
 Your highness, Q-Boro's finest 
 Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas 
 Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard 
 To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up 
 Feeling like you down on your luck 
 Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library 
 Appeal the game, all eyes on me 
 Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized 
 We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad 
 Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style 
 No heart and no look, shook 
 Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight 
 Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue 
 We too official, blue steel pistols 
 Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you 
  
 [Chorus: Havoc] 
 Dunn you fam to me, and only family 
 That can get that close to me, keep it type strong 
 Blowing green that's keeping us going 
 Unconditional love showing 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo

 [Skit] 
 The future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future 
 Some are just more into it than others...[Chorus] 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president 
 I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president

 Can I talk to ya?

 And we built this motherfucker 
 You wanna kill me because my hunger? 
 Mr. America young black niggas want ya 
 I wanna talk to the man, understand? 
 Understand this motherfuckin' G-pack in my hand 
 Look what happened to San Fran 
 Young girl hit by policeman 
 Twelve shots up in her dome, damn 
 Niggas thought we slept but the architect sent 
 The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret 
 The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now 
 Extension on Earth, human cutdown 
 Niggas play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations 
 On Mars plottin' civilizations 
 Dissin' us discriminatin' different races 
 Tax payers pay for more jail for Black Latin faces 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president 
 I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president

 Can I talk to ya? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard, damn 
 Niggas gotta go create his own job 
 Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard 
 Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved 
 Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive 
 Swing a mack to be live cardiac to get high 
 It's the ghetto life, yeah I celebrate it I live it 
 And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it 
 And y'all combinin' all the countries we goin' do the same 
 Combine all the cliques to make one gang 
 It ain't a black and white thing 
 It's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president 
 I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman

 [Verse 3] 
 What y'all waitin' for the world to blow up 
 Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless 
 Let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits 
 Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is 
 They try to buy us with dough 
 Fake black leaders of puppets always talkin' 'bout the city budget 
 The news got it all confused lyin' to the public 
 They eyes watchin' stay wise move above it 
 Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters 
 Its all signs of the Armageddon, three sixes 
 People reverse the system, politics verse religion 
 Holy war, muslim verse christians 
 Niggas in high places, they don't got the balls for this 
 People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us 
 Mr. President I assume it was negligence 
 The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president 
 I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman 
 I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president 
 I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman 
 Can I talk to ya? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Can I talk to you Mr. President 
 Niggas tryin to get with the computers 
 We ain't John Henry 
 Banging down fuckin'..? fighting against the machines 
 We want to be Part of the establishment nigga 
 That's what we are steppin up for 
 Ain't no cartoon out here 
 This shit is real 
 Total Package in this nigga 
 LES in this nigga 
 Ill Will nigga 
 Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment 
 Niggas are american baby 
 American Made[Intro: Erykah Badu] 
 This bitter land 
 Watered with my soul 
 The fruit it bears 
 Leaves me so cold 
 This bitter land 
 Does nothing for love 
 This bitter land 
 Brings pain from above, oh-oh 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Yeah, running on the concrete across the train tracks 
 The devil is behind me 
 In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at 
 Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire 
 But it never will define me 
 Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society 
 Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology 
 Tryna feed my seeds 
 Getting high on weed, study my degrees 
 Stay fly, getting paper 
 With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green 
 I'ma lean, taking Percs It’s a bitter Earth 
 Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean 
 It's a test, life is a test 
 Life is like a hood, hard 
 Trying not to fall between the cracks 
 In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark 
 Seems more appealing than the light in the land 
 Where you gotta fight 
 Catch a body in the night, we need a plan 
 To survive, to survive the land 
 Survive the storm, when it comes through 
 Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to 
 Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do? 
  
 [Verse 2: Erykah Badu] 
 This bitter land is far too real 
 This bitter land, it does not heal 
 Cause in the land skies are grey 
 But we fight the storms that come our way 
 A boy who strives to be a man 
 Must push to lead with all he can 
 Oh, this bitter land 
 Oh, bitter land 
 Oh, oh, oh, oooh 
 This bitter land, can't stop my fight 
 This bitter land 
  
 [Outro: Nas (Erykah Badu)] 
 Look what it's come to 
 So what you gonna do? 
 What you gonna do? 
 (My land)[Intro: Chrisette Michele] 
 Hip Hop 
 It will never die 
 Hip Hop 
 It will never, never die 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke 
 Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke 
 Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote 
 Those were the days I remember, we used to be close 
 Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember 
 Was slipping in December, two feet of snow 
 Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice 
 Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth 
 I understood I had to come from the hood 
 Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf 
 Before them phones chirped 
 The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work 
 You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis 
 Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic 
 Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish 
 Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever 
 I wish someone would step on my Bally leathers 
 Now it's whatever 
 Hip Hop's forever 
  
 Kept my radio on 98 or BLS 
 Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit 
 My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming 
 He knew from the inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it 
 He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick 
 Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest 
 I never had a summer job 
 Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees 
 Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's 
 I ain't work a day in my life 
 Wiping away eraser off the paper, man 
 I'm just trying to say it right 
 Big radio, tape's slowing down 
 Lower the lights go, battery dead 
 I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold 
 In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker 
 Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers 
 With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water 
 I let the shoestrings soak in water 
  
 [Outro: Nas (Chrisette Michele)]

 Hell yeah 
 Check it check it check, check check 
 Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call 
 If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls 
 Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot 
 Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits 
 A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head 
 The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed 
 First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned 
 For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because 
 DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her 
 Your local bodega is your supplier 
 And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin' 
 Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson 
 'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife 
 Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life 
 Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration 
 You wind up in a police station 
 DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it 
 She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted 
 DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P 
 With fly shorty P.Y.T 
 Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got 
 Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch 
 Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight 
 Then you can fuck shorty the same night 
 Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to 
 You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you 
 You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you 
 In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you 
 DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know 
 The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro 
 DON'T: eat the pussy the first night 
 Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit 
 DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice 
 A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right 
 Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick 
 When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick 
 DO: hit positions she will find interest in 
 DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin' 
 Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin' 
 Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress 
 Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex 
 Not too easy not too complex 
 I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex 
 Problems or questions, I can answer them best 
 Signin' off Dr. Knockboot at your request, peace 
  
 [Outro] 
 Rest havens 
 Fuck y'all bitches 
 Y'all niggas get y'all shit tight 
 Dr. Knockboot gotta come take y'all bitches from ya! 
 AIGHT?! We out![Verse 1] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail 
 The mic comes in contact with the third rail 
 My raps react, they attack the whack just like a maniac 
 With this, see I'm a brainiac 
 I'll call you tattoo, you never come off 
 I flip the script with a sawed-off, boss 
 A modern Shakespeare—reincarnated 
 Brains are elevated, I'm bein' R rated 
 This style is terror, drastic 
 Meltin' the plastic, and I eat mics just like acid 
 Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not 
 'Cause I be packin' like a Rasta in a weed spot 
 Hittin' your heart with a hollow-tip verbally illin' 
 Minds manipulated, my raps are nickel-plated 
 I execute raps like I'm swingin' an axe around 
 This is a mic shut down 
 Notify the President—that I'm bombin' your residence 
 And I'm leavin' no evidence 
 Voice box yells, lyrics'll excel 
 Rappers gettin' smoked, you can smell the hot shells 
 Your style is fake, snake, well dramatized 
 You might as well be a singer but ain't harmin' Nas 
 Here's the break, I can translate lyrics so well 
 I excel, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I got a case of vocal fever, I'm here to make you a believer 
 Nas wrecks the tweeters and receivers 
 Lyrics will explode, my brain overloads 
 Gimme a Grammy, competition is dead just like Sammy 
 I leave minds magnetized like slaves 
 Your style is old fashion like waves 
 Holdin' a pistol at a pastor, pullin' the trigger faster 
 Tell 'em I was sent by his Master 
 But that topic's too deep for your ear 
 Here's the science you can comprehend clear 
 Advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder 
 I'll know your whole card just like a palm reader 
 Non-stop, I'm bustin' heads like the FEDs baby pops 
 This is not the Kindergarten Cop 
 Put on your blindfold, I'ma release and stand tall 
 I detonate bombs at the Policeman's Ball 
 This is art from the heart, I leave 'em marked for death 
 In each breath, in this game, I'm the ref 
 Already I'm ill but I can only get better 
 With lyrics as pretty as a nickel-plated Beretta 
 I master dialects, of uncommon languages 
 A black man caught by the Klan couldn't hang with this 
 These are proverbs, copy cat attackers, huh 
 I'm wanted dead 'cause I'ma genocide to rappers 
 Battlin' Nas is dead when my brain reacts 
 You might as well have fell asleep on a train track 
 This ain't the same track that you're used to 
 This is rhythmatic, automatic, try it, you oughta have it 
 Slaughter your tape recorder; givin' thanks to my supporters 
 And keep flowin' like water 
 No matter the obstacle, Nasty Nas will prevail 
 Ayo, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Check it 
 I catch wreck with my intellect, suckers are incorrect 
 I'm gonna win 'cause you slept 
 On Nas, word is bond, I leave the microphone torn 
 False rappers, you need to write your own song 
 Metaphors are murder, man, hittin' like Roberto Duran 
 Hold the mic in my hand, my life span 
 Imitators will sweat me like gym class 
 Your raps are fat, shit, then I'll be Slim Fast 
 New rap recruits I salute then delete 'em 
 Verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em 
 Nas is a terrorist, analyst 
 Swingin' my fists like a nigga breakin', possessed by Satan 
 You couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow 
 Brothers is gettin' shipped out like I was Castro 
 I can eat your flavor but I'm not a candy lover 
 I use a Lethal Weapon, just like Danny Glover 
 Execute monologues, sabotage entourage 
 Mutilate mics like a maniac at large 
 I talk with slang, and use my brain 
 Generate pain, penetrate your vein 
 Move like a maniac, Nas is nice, son 
 Talk to your conscience and hit like Tyson 
 No competition, 'cause I cause wonders 
 Nas will battle rappers by the football numbers 
 A motor mouth killer, rhyme writin' thriller 
 Hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend 
 Don't sleep 'cause you might not wake 
 I speak deep, dialects I translate 
 Me and friends commit sins on the regular 
 Murder my competitors, and et cetera 
 Nas is a gypsy Egyptian 
 Flippin' the script and microphone manufacturers are victims 
 My voice makes your ear drums swell 
 It ain't hard to tell[Hook] 
 Live now niggas, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down 
 We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you 
 All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending 
 Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo 
 Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah 
 Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro 
  
 [Nas] 
 Picture my last days will be so grim 
 My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me 
 Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something 
 Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words 
 Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to 
 I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career 
 But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts 
 I would hit the scene for a second and bounce 
 Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick 
 Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it 
 Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits 
 Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it 
 From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me 
 You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with 
 So live now nigga 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Scarlett] 
 It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis 
 You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis 
 God, I respect you cause you never tied to smash 
 Since we met a while back, and your style was mack 
 Now I see that you a man after all you been through 
 A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou 
 Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could 
 But the white cells in my blood were no good 
 Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier 
 I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character 
 It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him 
 Just happy it didn't get in our kid 
 But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless 
 Remember days of diamond cuts 
 Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars 
 Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize 
 I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards 
 Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs 
 To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor 
 Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules 
 All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through 
 Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from 
 Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son 
 From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands 
 Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces 
 Critics and fans, they need to get a life 
 You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now 
 I grew with you so you know you make me proud 
 And most of all you gotta live now 
  
 [Hook: Scarlett] 
 Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you 
 We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you 
 All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending 
 Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo 
 Gotta live it up to the limit yo 
 Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro 
  
 [Scarlett] 
 Son, come close, lemme talk to you 
 I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it 
 Look out for little me, one[Intro] 
 Yeah.. 
 I want all my niggas to come journey with me 
 My name is Nas, and the year is 1973 
 Beginning of me, therefore, I could see 
 Through my belly button window, who I am... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I existed in a womb, just like an abyss 
 Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist 
 Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix 
 Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose 
 Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain 
 But to take on a name, my pops chose for me 
 Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes 
 Nine-months process, infant size 
 A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties 
 Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop 
 I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones 
 Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones 
 Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health 
 That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself 
 Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood 
 Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes 
 Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping 
 I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I shot my way out my mom dukes 
 I shot my way out my mom dukes 
 I shot my way out my mom dukes 
 I shot my way out my mom dukes 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive 
 Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive 
 When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes 
 I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live 
 Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe 
 All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie 
 Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube 
 I'm covered in this thick layer of goo 
 Month two was the least most comfortable 
 My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see 
 That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic 
 But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute 
 Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well 
 Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell 
 While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall 
 I wondered, "If I am born, will I be safe at all?" 
 This place they call the world though my view was so large 
 Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge 
 Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July 
 But the Lord already figured out a date and time 
 September 14th, 73 
 Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me 
 Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop 
 See how the government start retraining cops 
 Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced 
 Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too 
 Said "Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on 
 Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out 
 Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out 
 Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud 
 Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody 
 They washed me off and he say, "At least that nigga ain't ugly" 
 Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother 
 Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me 
 And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil 
 And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers 
  
 {*Doctor slaps the baby; the baby screams*}[Produced by Marley Marl] 
  
 [Sample] 
 On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal 
  
 [Intro] 
 Yeah, finally up in this nigga 
 Let's pay homage to Illmatic 
 Let's put the crown where it's at 10 years 
 Never been done this real by nobody 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil 
 In the categories of stories I breed my sequel 
 You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's 
 Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew 
 Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky 
 Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me 
 Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010 
 Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in 
 We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom 
 And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens 
 Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death 
 Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas 
 Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough 
 In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts 
  
 [Interlude] 
 That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old 
 Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles 
 This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow? 
 You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say 
 He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make 
 Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways 
 Listening close, to every word in case they violate 
 Up in the projects Apartment 5D 
 Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see 
 We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards 
 Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour 
 Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded 
 Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas 
 From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand 
 Police vans, they missed the summers again 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies 
 This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me 
 And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie? 
 The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me 
 After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money 
 So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry 
 My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies 
 While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees 
 The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga 
 Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders 
 I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow 
 Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo' 
 You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions 
 Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God 
 Religion was fast women, expensive cars 
 Y'all witnessin over 10 years, the best of Nas[Intro] 
 Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world 
 It's a new world, it's a new world 
 Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, celebrate the new life 
 New ways to make money 
 New ways to break dummies 
 Forge they name and take money 
 Computers ain't that smart 
 Whatever man built could be taken apart 
 Anything new can get old 
 Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold 
 Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive 
 No propellers in the sky 
 Airplanes like many rockets 
 Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars 
 While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs 
 A man's forced to live off land 
 Now it's back to the caveman era 
 When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together 
 The truth is, many are too scared of new data 
 America Online, cut off, see you later 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin' 
 A new way to play, a new way a livin' 
 Cash is the past, a new way a spendin' 
 New life for man, children, and women 
 Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin' 
 A new way to play, a new way a livin' 
 Cash is the past, a new way a spendin' 
 New life for man, children, and women 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones 
 Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome 
 The new Don Trump is Bill Gates 
 Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake 
 And cake mean his stock, net gross 
 Young kids step it up, go for the most 
 New cameras in police cars takin' pictures 
 New hustlas gettin' new street figures 
 And US embassies overseas 
 Almost every foreign country's under siege 
 Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals 
 Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's 
 Oil in the earth spills 
 Girls blow they body up, birth control pills 
 African's pick diamonds out a dark caves 
 Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin' 
 A new way to play, a new way a livin' 
 Cash is the past, a new way a spendin' 
 New life for man, children, and women 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Say goodbye to the brainwashed 
 Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart 
 Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts 
 Yo, it's real 
 Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal 
 Say hello to the one world 
 Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I 
 More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones 
 Your genes and DNA is used to make clones 
 You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers 
 Then what happens when circuit breaks? 
 Y2K's the big scare 
 Scientists say we ain't prepared 
 What I feel is contrare 
 Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes 
 But now we request for your e-mail address 
 I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways 
 But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin' 
 A new way to play, a new way a livin' 
 Cash is the past, a new way a spendin' 
 New life for man, children, and women[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Black hoods, cops and projects 
 Sewers flooded with foul blockage 
 The gutter's wild and every child watches 
 Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges 
 Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off 
 Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare 
 Vision blurry, 'cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories 
 Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era 
 He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out 
 The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out 
 So many ways out the hood but no signs say out 
 Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off 
 Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off 
 You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought 
 To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again 
 Plan to leave somethin' behind 
 So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on 
  
 [Chorus: Ron Isley] 
 Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out) 
 Oh, I feel uninspired 
 Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window 
 (Oh, I'm lookin' out) 
 Oh, it makes me feel, so tired 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles 
 Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you 
 Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo 
 They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*} 
 Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9 
 Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York 
 Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul 
 Take it or leave it, just my evaluation 
 Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate 
 But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison 
 To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast 
 Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow 
 Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson 
 Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons 
 A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Ron Isley] 
 Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out) 
 Oh, I feel uninspired 
 Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window 
 (Oh, I'm lookin' out) 
 Oh, it makes me feel, so tired 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla 
 She said, "go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow 
 Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes 
 Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool 
 Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat 
 He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework 
 At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out 
 A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out 
 So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune 
 Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly 
 But jail was ahead of me, speedin' like amphetamine 
 Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run 
 I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there 
 I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds 
 And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs 
 Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's 
 This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows 
  
 [Chorus: Ron Isley] 
 Oh, outta my window 
 Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out) 
 Oh, I feel uninspired 
 Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window 
 (Oh, I'm lookin' out) 
 Oh, it makes me feel, so tired 
 Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out) 
 Oh, I feel uninspired 
 Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window 
 (Oh, I'm lookin' out) 
 Oh, it makes me feel, so tired 
  
 [Outro: Ron Isley] 
 Starin' out of, out my window 
 Oh I, feel so tired 
 Oh yeah, outta my window 
 Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out of 
 Lookin' out my window, oh yeah 
 Makes me, feel so tired 
 Lookin' out of my project window 
 Oh, it makes me feel, so tired[Intro: Nas + crowd] 
 "Picture us married, you and me," what? 
 "K-I-S-S-I-N-G" 
 "I remember the first time, girl you and me . . ." 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 This ain't no sucka-for-love shit 
 This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit 
 First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day 
 This a thug's wedding day, in love 
 Will we make it? Let us pray 
 In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers 
 Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted 
 Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though 
 Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more 
 Yes I'm absolutely sure 
 I know that she love me, I know that she faithful 
 We spoke on a prenumptial agreement 
 Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it 
 Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought 
 Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit 
 But know this 
 You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick 
 Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin 
 Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones 
 Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun 
 Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling 
 Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married 
 To who I knew not 
 Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock 
 Pumpin Sade, my head nod 
 Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French 
 Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop 
 Couldn't wait to blaze that 
 Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin' 
 Everybody bump the same bunnies 
 The game, will put niggas in they grave 
 Right before they part ways, with the street 
 I want a son to greet, every mornin' 
 Daughters and more sons tickle my feet 
 Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat 
 I'm getting married 
  
 [Hook: Nas] (3X) 
 Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo 
 It was difficult for me to find the chick I want 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride 
 Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side 
 That's what the negative one's say 
 Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day 
 I know the hoes gonna miss me 
 Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me 
 Start chokin' up since I woke up 
 Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up 
 Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm 
 Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm 
 Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng 
 Customized in London by guys who suitup kings 
 Girl, you get the rings young, you behave 
 Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang 
 Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi 
 Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy 
 Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out 
 Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out 
 My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones 
 'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones 
 That's a union that nobody could touch 
 I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles 
 Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit 
 Court cases, baby mamas 
 I make a honest woman outta you yet 
 Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin 
 Heart poundin out my chest like a canon 
 I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it 
 But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful 
 I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true 
 Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO 
 Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to 
 I'm getting married 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 I'm getting married 
  
 [Produced by Chucky Thompson]*Man laughing* 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum 
 Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum 
 Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days 
 In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze 
 I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke 
 That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off 
 The infrastructure caves in, amazin' 
 I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men 
 Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless 
 When their momma love the kid's records I made 
 You gutless, you don't know struggle 
 Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you 
 Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine 
 I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen 
 Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand 
 I'mma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused 
 Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes 
 Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions 
 God'll forgive you bastards 
 Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it? 
 Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished 
 Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla 
 Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah 
 You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it 
 You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap 
 Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's 
 Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties 
 Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours 
 Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes 
 Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys 
 Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage 
 You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary 
 Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies 
 And all of y'all wear that same aroma 
 How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya 
 You're wack nigga, face it 
 In the history of the game, you have no placement 
 Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity 
 Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth 
 But when the sun go south, them guns come out 
 My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin 
 Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me 
 Straight savage[Intro: Nas (Wiz)] 
 Braveheart for life 
 Zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out 
 Uhh, Salaam Remi! 
 Yeah, zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out, what, yeah 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out 
 (I want y'all to blast on these niggas, man) 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out 
  
 [Verse 1: Jungle] 
 Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket 
 Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects 
 We live the life where the blood spills 
 Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed 
 Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him 
 Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, forehead yawning 
 Sloppy, droppin' you birds 
 Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve 
 No bullshit, back in ya head, find me 
 Call Earl, death is the ways of the world 
 Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack 
 Bust guns at Bow Wow's age 
 Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell 
 Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12 
 Way too foul walk around all the time 
 With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes 
  
 [Verse 2: Wiz] 
 Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas 
 Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes 
 Keep it, dead serious 
 Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin' 
 Now you sleep with them fishes 
 G-W-I-Z, so delicious 
 To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts 
 I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son 
 And this is the military turn it up 
 My Uzi weighs a ton. a ton, your son less thump nah 
 Heat talk feet walk you run uh 
 Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come 
 Drop son, pull out 
 You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket 
 The peeps be like one (one) 
 I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 G-O-D S-O-N 
 I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen 
 With my testosterone, male hormone 
 Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E 
 Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible 
 Like Mike Jack said 
 For me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem 
 That's dead, who made this style, Solo or X 
 Are you UTFO's Doctor or Moe Dee 
 Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death 
 I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas 
 Remember the, original, y'all still tryin' to show niggas ya rich 
 Town house niggas 
 I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries 
 Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired 
 While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up 
 A million of us, each nigga inchin' to bust 
 You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us 
 Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck 
 No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway 
  
 [Verse 4: Jungle] 
 Yo, this is for them high school drop outs 
 Niggas who copped out 
 If you prefer shots over knockouts 
 Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed 
 Sellin' crack, sellin' smack 
 You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back 
 Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end 
 Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend 
 I used to have a bike on a bench 
 Now I got the Jeep on this trip 
 Coke in the pot, heat on my hip 
  
 [Verse 5: Wiz] 
 Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin' 
 Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens 
 Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is 
 Useless to these swift executioners 
 And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day 
 Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze 
 Runnin' from D's quickly knockout rookies 
 G Wiz you know what I'm all about 
 To all my real niggas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out 
 Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out[Nas] 
 I think I can remember some... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister 
 Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista 
 Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her 
 Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker 
 Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick 
 Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement 
 Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her 
 Put hickeys on her stomach 
 Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw 
 Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume 
 That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude 
 Used to put my face in her crotch 
 Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched 
 Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer 
 While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha 
 While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker 
  
 [Hook] 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes 
 Remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes 
 And all the wild things I used to do 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes 
 Remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remembering the times it was on my mind 
 But none of them could touch you 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes 
 Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction 
 Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection 
 Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log 
 Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind 
 Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us 
 Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher 
 Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa 
 The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong 
 Under the coat and 
 Put a show on just to show me she loved me 
 She would undress and wait in zero below weather 
 In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive 
 Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin' 
 Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin 
 Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it 
 Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets 
 Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters 
 Long chin, some with funny odors 
 Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese 
 Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease 
 And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool 
 And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww 
 Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas 
 Principles are lined up, things prioritized 
 Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown 
 It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer 
 Are we tempted 
  
 [Hook][Produced by Scott Storch] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Uh, light somethin', stop frontin' 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures 
 Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters 
 That'd kill me yo, filthy rich 
 My daughter pass it onto the next generation 
 Throwing carnations at my tombstone 
 In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on 
 Then we do a dance 
 Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first 
 I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up 
 Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward 
 Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class 
 Strictly that kush in the weed bags 
 Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production 
 Studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin 
 Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa 
  
 [Hook: Snoop Dogg] 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa 
 Before it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters 
 Do y'all thing, ménage, swing, baby 
 Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Get your papes on, play on, playa 
 Get your papes on, play on, playa 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose 
 Rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy 
 But a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking 
 Tied up in a knot top of my bean head 
 Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals 
 Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's 
 No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough 
 Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings 
 On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus 
 ‘Cause this big money aroma lingers 
 Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade 
 Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit 
 After they eat so they can stay lightweight 
 Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake 
 Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean 
 Where I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's 
 On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets 
 Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price 
 But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice 
 That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil 
 True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning 
 Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending 
 Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her 
 Got to get your papes on, play on, playa 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Snoop] 
 It's kinda hard for a playa like you 
 But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue 
 What you never do is punk out, what you better do 
 Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view 
 Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you 
 Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly 
 Roll me another blunt, stuff it 
 Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it 
 That man, that game, that thing it busts 
 In D-O-Double-G we trust 
 Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps 
 He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks 
 Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!) 
 End of existence, for instance 
 Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it 
 Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it 
 Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo 
 I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs 
 My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief 
 La-da-da, be-da-ba-da… 
 Yeah, break that down, how fresh you are? 
 The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar 
 Connect with the best from the West, yes-yes, you are 
 Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas; playa, play on[Intro] 
 I want to dedicate this song right here 
 To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson 
 Peace to those brothers 
 I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm 
 Eighty years 
 Come home nigga 
 Come home, niggas 
 .. Ugh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I just burnt my American flag 
 And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad 
 Ugh, I'm loading tips in my Mag' 
 To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag 
 Choke him out with his confederate flag 
 I know these devils are mad 
 Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia 
 Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 Huh? Would you testify? 
 You buy my songs 
 You buy my songs 
 But will you ride with me? 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 You understand my struggle 
 That's what you claim right? 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 Then get your aim right 
 And get your game tight 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it 
 Coming to concerts singing ho and shit 
 Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches 
 I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it 
 I heard y'all was downloading it, heh 
 Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit, heh 
 Like ah, William Cooper 
 Who told you the Pale Horse is the future 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 Would you testify on some realness like that? 
 I think you scared (heh) 
 I don't think you prepared 
 Yeah 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 You know what I'm asking you? 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 Do we know what I'm asking you? (hahaha) 
 Wow... 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 Wow... 
 (Testifyyyyy for me) 
 (Testifyyyyy for me)[Intro: Future] 
 Dress it up and make it real for me 
 Whatever that fucking means 
  
 [Hook: Future] 
 Dirty soda in a styrofoam 
 Spend a day to get my mind blown 
 Dress it up and go to Nassau 
 200 miles on the dash 
 And gotta roll a pound up and gas it 
 Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide 
 We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas 
 Til these niggas start acting 
 Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie 
 Nigga, gone let 'em have it 
 Ballin' like the March Madness 
 All these cops shooting niggas, tragic 
 I'm the one that's living lavish 
 Like I'm playing for the Mavericks 
 I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 Reflect with radiance 
 Rising consciousness of my people in the stadiums 
 Or I can get ignorant like that nigga Maury Povich portray us as 
 I'm hip hop baby dad 
 And all of y'all my litter, my little kids 
 And my label's Mass Appeal 
 A blunt, a pill and some liquor 
 I get to my hitters, they spray your ass 
 Get money fast, R.I.P. the check, smell my kilo breath 
 I spit and I freeze you to death 
 Cuban tobacco mouth, trap nigga cologne 
 Been had the OG respect 
 Pick the city, I knock four of ya' baddest 
 16 chillin' with Supreme Magnetic 
 Fort Greene nigga with a little Queens bastard 
 Now I'm in a Ghost or a Benz or an Aston, icon status 
 And we still strapped case you niggas want static 
 Still ballin', still mackin' 
 Niggas ain't a 100, he 60/40 
 We 50/50, that's automatic 
 My niggas got open cases 
 But niggas got watches and bracelets 
 And cee-lo, I never throw aces 
 Don't give a fuck about racists 
 Pray that my niggas come out of the FEDs 
 Shout to my niggas who dead 
 We got the stripes 
 All I got is my real niggas for life 
 Nas pour henny, Future pour dirty sprite 
  
 [Hook: Future] 
 Dirty soda in a styrofoam 
 Spend a day to get my mind blown 
 Dress it up and go to Nassau 
 200 miles on the dash 
 And gotta roll a pound up and gas it 
 Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide 
 We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas 
 Til these niggas start acting 
 Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie 
 Nigga, gone let 'em have it 
 Ballin' like the March Madness 
 All these cops shooting niggas, tragic

 [Verse 1:Nas] 
 Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors 
 Shout to them niggas 
 Family men, bringing home dinners 
 Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home 
 Miserable and alone 
 Kissable, nice to bone 
 She not the type deserving of a throne 
 Her beauty is her curse 
 She fuck for shoes and a purse 
 Make me a movie first 
 Can watch you on my phone 
 I shop in Barcelona 
 I spend some nights in Rome 
 Feel like a Knight from England 
 That's what I named my son, Knight 
 He was born to be one 
 That's how my game was won 
 White 740 Beamer 
 Licked by an angel's tongue 
 I'm living dangerous son 
 She got a man, a famous one 
 Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options 
 Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with 
 Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed 
 She got the hottest sex 
 So I guess I'mma just stay 
  
 [Refrain] 
  
 [Verse 2:Nas] 
 Even though I don't like you 
 Next Friday night can't wait to fight you 
 Locked up I would knife you 
 Don't fuck with you 
 Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked 
 I felt bad, wait do I got love for you 
 I might kill you but do I got love for you 
 I want you dead under six feet of soil 
 At the same time 
 Want you here to witness me while you in misery 
 We hate each other but it's love 
 What a thug mystery 
 Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy 
 We enemies but your hatred could never enter me 
 Some seek fame cause they need validation 
 Some say hating is confused admiration 
 Spotlight on me 
 I still look twenty 
 Still get money, lady killer 
 Pushing a Bentley 
 Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer 
 I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay 
  
  
 [Verse 1: J. Cole] 
 You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears 
 God and my court date, the two things I fear 
 Man, they tryna give a nigga years 
 I’m tryna figure if I should even appear 
 Or should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound 
 Change my name, right – catch a plane flight 
 Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me 
 Come and catch me if you want me 
 Know they’ll lock me if I stay 
 But where I’mma run to? 
 I got a good girl, we got a son too 
 And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye 
 But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die 
 So if they give me one, or if they give me two 
 Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few 
 Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do? 
 Would you find someone new or would you stay? 
 Like the hoes when they lay with me? 
 Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me” 
 Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to 
 But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to 
 Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you 
 That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you 
 Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate 
 I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay 
  
 [Hook] 
 Stay 
  
 [Verse 2: J. Cole] 
 Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step 
 I’m gettin’ grown now 
 And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around 
 Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound 
 I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound 
 Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now 
 Got my mind on the city where it goes down 
 See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay 
 Although I love it here 
 I’ll be damned if I sit around another year 
 Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear 
 The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here 
 Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that 
 Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that 
 Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back 
 Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay[Intro: Nas and Kelis] 
 What nigga! What bitch-ass niggas! What! 
 Babe, babe, start the car! 
 (Nasir, come on, let's go! 
 Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go! 
 Aight, aight, aight, yeah 
 But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though 
 (This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car? 
 This is so stupid, what are you doing? 
 Why are we even out here? 
 Why are we out here? What's going on? 
 This is retarded, yo, we gotta… 
 This is crazy. Never again 
 You'd throw everything away, for what? 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, "Son, do not look back" 
 Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax 
 When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em 
 At this point in my life I'm all about chillin' 
 Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies 
 And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride 
 That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga 
 Just ‘cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga 
 I know who died before the body dropped 
 I know the guns that were used 
 How much money the shooter got 
 ‘Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all 
 The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time 
 Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all 
 Who to call and who to stay away from 
 Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son 
 Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up 
 What cars and what trucks they drive in 
 What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin' 
 I found out most of them are cowards 
 They hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back 
  
 [Hook: Kelis and Nas] 
 The streets keep tryin' to say 
 Come back around this way 
 I've already gone that way 
 I won't go back today 
 I'm not going back! 
 X2 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 First thing that happen when you make a little paper 
 You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper 
 Till you come across some ever more flyer paper 
 Realize that five-star tellies are even greater 
 Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit 
 Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it 
 First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes 
 All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid 
 ‘Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary 
 The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me 
 It kinda make me wanna hate bling 
 It's a race thing how they sell blacks to bootleg shit 
 In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings 
 Whores charge niggas with raping 
 ‘Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars 
 Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars 
 So they counter the laws to take what's ours 
 'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge 
 So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars 
 Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects 
 But I'm not going back 
 The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to 
 Those no friends of mine… (And I'm not going back to) 
 Ten carat gold, it shine… (And I'm never going back to) 
 Sony, if they don't have dough to sign… 
 (Not going back to) 
 Y'all know that I'm not going back to 
 Those liars who would… (Not going back to) 
 Not help you if they could… (Not going back to) 
 Coke on the stove in the hood… 
 Y'all should know that I'm not going back 
 The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back 
  
 [Hook][Keon Bryce] 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feeling alright 
 I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down 
 Cause my third eye sees the lowdown 
 And I know it's not my time to go now 
 Cause God's got my back in this showdown 
 So I know we'll be alright 
  
 [Nas] 
 Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holding those 
 Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks 
 Silver fo'-fo', got no 
 My chauffer driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali 
 Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window 
 Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little 
 Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica 
 Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her 
 And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize 
 I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise 
 And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me 
 But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop 
  
 [Keon Bryce] 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And all this drama's got me feeling uptight 
 I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo 
 Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard 
 Holding our baby in her baby in her arms 
 So hold on, your daddy's in sight 
  
 [Nas] 
 Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes 
 For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying 
 Planned to be a strong black family 
 But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing 
 Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with 
 Nothing but the worst type, worst fight 
 When we brought my baby home the first night 
 Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging 
 In my new car bought from entertainment 
 Champaign and gaining clout fast, whiplash 
 Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass 
 Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me" 
 I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi 
 Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine 
 She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again 
 Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers 
 Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems 
 New woman, she's great, this a different world 
 Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl 
 It's so amazing playing, life is so crazy 
 I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me 
  
 [Keon Bryce] 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feeling alright 
 I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down 
 Cause my third eye sees the lowdown 
 And I know it's not my time to go now 
 Cause God's got my back in this showdown 
 So I know we'll be alright[Verse 1: Nas] 
  
 What up? 
 Escobar season begins 
 Repent your sins 
 Nine-Six 
 Trackmasters 
 Check it 
  
 Spark the lye with the eight-forty I fly 
 Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry 
 Maybe I'm just too demanding, parked the Land 
 Mark Buchanan, fuck a job I'mma die scramblin 
 Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul 
 Que Pasa, Pablo's throne cabron 
 At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck 
 Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck 
 So whats the deal Papi? 
 Heard the feds could of knocked me 
 Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby 
 Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin' 
 Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan 
 The Firm waitin', to get ajourned cause we facing 
 Double life, thuggin for life, you taste it 
 The white numbin ya toungue 
 I bought it from Dominicans 
 A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers 
 Had the Firm gun slingers, hit the lights, grab the white 
 Murder everything in site, and jet in the Bimmers 
 Now im home with the phone screaner 
 Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner 
 Checkin my mail reading my supoena 
 To the witness standing, I got remanded 
 Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it 
 Gotta fight my case from the inside 
 Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling 
 But thats the game for ya 
 Hid a stash to ya lawyers 
 Supreme court, Queens New York will bore ya' 
 Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut 
 Million dollar bail what? 
 Z put up the house and I was out 
 Word the Fuck Up 
 Time to get the shit on son 
 Tryna trap a nigga 
 Incarcerate me yo' 
 Check it tho, yo, yo 
  
 Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die 
 (cross my heart hope to die) 
 Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die 
  
 Praise the Lord, ive been scarred with hot water 
 Days are shorter, next court dates around the corner 
 Money ain't the same, shit is outta order 
 Since the days of Rich Porter 
 Something gotta give, I ain't trying to bid 
 Now I run up in cribs, body shit, but no women no kids 
 In the Bridge where the murderers live 
 I used to make a quarter million monthly 
 I was ill until they sunk me 
 Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots 
 Bought a passport off a junkie 
 The Firm helped me flee out the country 
 Word and I'm out, Pakastinian land 
 Chilling with my man Jungle 
 The commissioner Stout 
 Killa B, what it is nigga firm biz[Intro] 
 Yo, yeah 
 It's that Queens shit, the real shit 
 Illmatic 
 It's the N-A-S, yes 
 Yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I wake up every morning 
 Thinking what we gonna do today (what we gonna do today) 
 There's got to be a better way (got to be a better way) 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 Maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
  
 [Verse] 
 1, 2... I never knock a brother, I'm anti-jail for real 
 Smooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield 
 Watching niggas get rich beside me 
 Pushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat 
 But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom 
 Sipping Asti Spumante, dripped in, reality kicks in 
 I need the papes to start clicking 
 Got a connect out in Richmond, ain't nigga in the fam will pitch in 
 It's on, word is bond, that's my name, big Nas, all wise to civilize 
 From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth 
 Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth 
 Destiny, that's her name 
 It's going on, you know my name 
 Big Nas in the house, y'all, on the freestyle tip 
 When I finish this shit, it's sure to be a hit 
 Peace, peace[Nas] 
 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes 
 Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid 
 Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you 
 Look around it might hit you 
 No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you 
 Shit comes around faster than you think 
 Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you? 
 Become a creature of habitat, the average cat 
 Won't see where it's at, or where it's going 
 The hood waits for no one 
 I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings 
 Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations 
 From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration 
 Imagination is what they lack 
 It stops niggas from getting stacks 
 Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks 
 Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple 
  
 [Hook] 
 "From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample) 
 "Starring out, a young disciple" (Nas Sample) 
 "You had that gleam in your eye" (Olu Daru sample) 
 Disciple of the projects! 
 "From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample) 
 "Street's Disciple" (Nas Sample) 
 "Disciple of the projects" (Olu Daru sample) 
  
 [Nas] 
 Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions 
 That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life 
 In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson 
 After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock 
 In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture 
 Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts 
 Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it 
 Coke baggin and toe-taggin 
 They took Will, let me describe him, a live one 
 I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless 
 His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin 
 Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you" 
 He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered 
 But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it 
 Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2 
 With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking 
 Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen 
 Captain Hook to these infants 
 It's like my folks is still on the benches 
 Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention 
 1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval 
 Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid 
 Rhyming to music all this time 
 Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it 
 Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave 
 From the block, where the world was forever freezing 
 Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again 
 Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them 
 Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats 
 Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope 
 He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke 
 Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies 
 Babies born in a cycle, future disciples 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1] 
 Peace, peace 
 Yo, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah 
 Fist full of dollars in a dice game God 
 D&G glasses, cloth Kangols, guided by angel with white wings 
 Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful 
 Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor 
 Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor 
 More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em 
 The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming 
 The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up 
 My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus 
 Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers 
 But they small as a shanty in a African village 
 Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers 
 Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia 
 You screaming like you love war 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop 
 Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop 
 But everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Peace, fuck you with a fist in your ass 
 You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag 
 You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em 
 8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting 
 'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying 
 No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing 
 Niggas get flashier houses more plusher 
 Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger 
 Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing 
 Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing 
 I'm light year far, your mouth get all white 
 When I'm near you I frighten your heart 
 I want you to watch me notice stare look closely 
 Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you 
 Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes 
 Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop 
 Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop 
 But everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots 
 War cost money and man I got too many spots 
 Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up 
 Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up 
 Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching 
 We all connected so your man know my man 
 Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up 
 Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what 
 Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive 
 Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job 
 Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high 
 Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise 
 So we play a mental game, intimidation 
 Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying 
 I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and 
 Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying 
 Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe 
 I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face 
 Play dirty catch your moms in J-30 
 Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop 
 Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop 
 But everybody's crazy 
 And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop 
 Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop[Hook] 
 I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is 
 I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest 
 I'm maintaining, still keeping my status 
 Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest 
 Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses 
 How could you pass this? Your loss 
 But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss 
 I won't be another black girl lost 
 Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost 
 I won’t be another black girl lost 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious 
 Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick 
 Very mystic, bald stitches her wig 
 Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes 
 Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed 
 Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big 
 My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you 
 Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like 
 Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream 
 Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs 
 But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason? 
 You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome 
 So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget 
 You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging 
 Financial liberty you're after, it's how you live 
 But the blood test shows it's not even his kid 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Chanel bags, everything 
 She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring 
 This her 3rd marriage, 4 carats 
 Brand new Jag, deserves to have it 
 Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits 
 Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic 
 She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Mansion 
 She fucks all my mans, and they pop the magnums 
 So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue 
 'Posed to get married, now you embarassed 
 Who does this kid belong to? 
 Promiscuous, cuz' she got touched by step-dad, sex at 
 Such a young age, if you was a virgin, I'd get mad 
 Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong 
 I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent 
 This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs 
 I just love you, really love you 
 Here for you, wanna trust you 
 Wanna cuff you, be my lady 
 But first, I gotta see the baby 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ladies, I believe in you 
 We gotta stop this craziness out here, though 
 We gotta get right 
 Because when we both get right, we both take flight 
 Us real men need you, for real[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Cup'a Hen', cup'a Goose, cup'a Cris' 
 White chain, colored watch on a wrist 
 Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience 
 Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious 
 Step to bars, we just order dark liquors 
 Clear liquors, y'all niggas are s-e-x 
 Yes we get respected, eclectic messages 
 Left our brains, straight into a female's estrogen 
 She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them 
 Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction 
 N-a-s, bend they ass, over-spank it 
 Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas 
 Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull' 
 Before I get either I need some Red Bull 
 She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool 
 When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool 
 That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing 
 Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything 
 Gotta come up, run up and get touched up 
 Suicide, that's if you confront us 
  
 [Hook] 
 Don't talk, just hold your breath (breath) 
 Been here a while, only one nigga left (left) 
 And all'a y'all know my style (style) 
 I spend dough but I still let it pile (pile) 
 Mama shake ya thing 
 Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang (bang) 
 You put it on and on and on and on 
 Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Uh, from a boy to a king 
 Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings 
 I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mayn 
 I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything 
 Fellas who beat bodies with me 
 Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me 
 Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks 
 Old cats only roll when I'm in the city 
 And the dance floor it's disgustin' 
 Move your waistline to the basic percussion 
 I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin' 
 And laugh when a nigga start frontin' 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes 
 Her light eyes, pretty lips, fly face 
 First you said you would spread for me in an instant 
 See me with the next chick, now you act different 
 Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her 
 Play your position, you way outta character 
 Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors 
 Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse 
 On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless 
 The army's so thick you can't harm us 
  
 [Hook][Chorus] 
 In America you'll never be free 
 Middle fingers up, fuck the police 
 Damn, can't a nigga just breathe? 
 Braveheart, still QB's Finest 
 Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate 
 Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe 
 Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis (uhh) 
 Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him 
 Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? (woo!) 
 To all my niggas getting money in the streets (yeah) 
 Middle fingers up, fuck the police 
 Light up my trees, and I just breathe... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim 
 Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom 
 From pot to piss in to high position 
 Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle 
 'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks 
 'Til I dodge enough shots, and the presiding judge slams a mallet 
 And says life I'ma guap, then I cop 
 Then I yacht, then I dock 
 Island hopping away from nightmare holders 
 Or cowboy slingers who shoot up any club 
 That see they names ring loud on some FBI poster 
 Must be on Ex or they coked up, suggesting I post a 
 Bail, I'm like yes, 'cause we soldiers 
 We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime 
 I can't afford a new arrest on my folder 
 (Nigga, breathe...) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 In America you'll never be free 
 Middle fingers up, fuck the police 
 Damn, can't a nigga just breathe? 
 Braveheart, still QB's Finest 
 Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate 
 Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe 
 Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis (uhh) 
 Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him 
 Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? (woo!) 
 To all my niggas getting money in the streets (get money) 
 Middle fingers up, fuck the police (fuck 'em) 
 Light up my trees, and I just breathe... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm, fresh out of city housing, ain't have too many options 
 Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded 
 Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see 
 My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me 
 The high life, the fly life 
 Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ 
 Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy 
 The Lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me 
 The pestilence of the ghetto informed me 
 As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740 
 With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on 
 They sick, mixing they water with Airborne 
  
 [Outro] 
 Oh, they so sick! 
 Look how I got 'em going crazy, look at that! 
 You gotta let it out, stress...ain't good man 
 You gotta breathe (breathe...) 
 And America, we gotta be free 
 Breathe... 
 Breathe... 
 Breathe... 
 Breathe...[Intro: Nas] 
 QB, the whole NYC 
 We gon' bounce to this 
 All my niggas (yeah, yeah) 
 All the ladies 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? 
 This game is risky 
 If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me? 
 Dead partners too soon 
 All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em 
 Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I... 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at 
 These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle 
 I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too 
 Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out 
 Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine 
 Knowin' nothin' about this murder game 
 It's easily told but hard to hear 
 When niggas finally find out it's real 
 That's when they heart pumps fear 
 The real remain, the weak will disappear 
 My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear 
 911 style sits on your mind like chrome 
 Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam 
 What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome 
 You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown 
 As we travel on this road, an infinite path 
 I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash 
 Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat? 
 Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? 
 This game is risky 
 If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me? 
 Dead partners too soon 
 All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em 
 Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I... 
  
 [Verse 2: Nature] 
 I know a lot of fiends by their first name, livin' in Queens 
 A lot of cats gettin' stuck for they chains 
 Holdin' dirty guns, the young old dirty ones 
 Runnin' wild, nigga, I raise hell above ground 
 Live in sin, holdin' rocks, Benjamin Grimm 
 Figure once I got knocked, it would end—never that 
 They try to tell me I don't love my own 
 The thugs know, they ride my zone, like The Cyclone 
 Trademark for Coney Isle, yeah, they know me now 
 I'm givin' niggas fake hugs, phony smiles 
 Stack profits, you know how niggas on the block get 
 Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets 
 Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land 
 You couldn't tell if they wolves or lamb (Ha, word) 
 You could fight like a few, there's a few that ran 
 Or you could feed them and lose your hand 
 What you wanna do? 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? 
 This game is risky 
 If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me? 
 Dead partners too soon 
 All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em 
 Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I... 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Blessings be to the ones who left us 
 To transcend into spiritual essence, in Allah's arms you restin' 
 To Him we pray for my peeps 
 Louie Lloyd Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sonny back in the day 
 "Get that money, yam," he used to say 
 Not only nice with hands but street smarts, he was twice a man 
 I try to understand life's deep plot, I think of Weewop 
 Shikeisha, they both was mad nice on the rock 
 They woulda went pro, but only God, he only knows why not 
 Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers be not clean 
 You come around, he start snappin' on you, makin' a scene 
 Kept the lye, cool nigga, warm heart, and stayed fly 
 You still alive, I see you in your sister's face 
 Are you nearby or lookin' on, just from a distant place? 
 My thoroughbreds, Black Ed, quiet but real 
 Expect to see your black Jeep come fly over the hill 
 In the spirit of Richie Lou, tribute 
 Remind the world of the crime that NY pigs do, we miss you 
 Never forget you, Harry and Sonia 
 Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier 
 T.J. Black, better known as Killer 
 I can't replace you, but in me 
 Havoc will always have a brother, my nigga 
 My man Will, until we meet again 
 You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here 
 I hope y'all hear my prayers clear 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? 
 This game is risky 
 If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me? 
 Dead partners too soon 
 All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em 
 Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I... 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Rest in peace to my grandfathers, Papa Charlie... 
 (Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?) 
 Rest in peace to my man's Horse pops, nam'sayin'? One love 
 (If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?) 
 Can't forget Nana, my man L.E.S. grandmom, nam'sayin'? 
 (All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em) 
 They still wit' us, though; I wonder where they at? 
 (Sometimes I...) How near, how far? 
 Sometimes I wonder (What?) 
 Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? (Can't go under) 
 This game is risky 
 If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?[Intro] 
 Uhh.. 
 Uh.. speak without thinkin'.. 
 Speak without speakin'.. huh.. 
 Feel without reachin', uhh 
 That's what it's about 
 It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknahmean? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know) 
 And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know) 
 'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh 
 And I know he feel us, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause he be with us in the prisons 
 And he takes time to listen, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh 
 But he forgive us 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 He who has ears, let him hear 
 And he who has sight, let him see 
 He who has life, let him be 
 See everything goes through change 
 Those who know don't talk 
 And those who talk don't know a thing 
 Men are born soft and turn tough 
 Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God 
 I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart 
 By the beast but he missed his mark 
 Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up 
 When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all 
 Yo it came to me, the pain in me 
 Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be 
 It strangely seemed, like it was a dream 
 But the si-rens had never woke me 
 Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me 
 And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga 
 But God love us hood niggas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know) 
 And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know) 
 'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh 
 And I know he feel us, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause he be with us in the prisons 
 And he takes time to listen, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh 
 But he forgive us 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Day by day by day I sit back and pray 
 My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage 
 They pass away, they went off the casket way 
 My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today 
 So long my crimes now gone for eternity 
 The team we got left on the set, now turn to me 
 Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind 
 I ride past the church where they got his body and find 
 They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt 
 That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt 
 Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution 
 As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses 
 Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully 
 For self, though it feels like, he was there for me 
 Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me 
 They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know) 
 And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know) 
 'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh 
 And I know he feel us, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause he be with us in the prisons 
 And he takes time to listen, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh 
 But he forgive us 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood 
 Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood 
 Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood 
 Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood 
 It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood 
 You can choose if you would, coke to sniff 
 Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees 
 Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood 
 You can starve in the hood 
 Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood 
 But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood 
 Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood 
 I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood 
 Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood 
 There's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?) 
 Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke 
 That's the main reason why God, love us the most 
  
 [Chorus] 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know) 
 And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know) 
 'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh 
 And I know he feel us, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause he be with us in the prisons 
 And he takes time to listen, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh 
 But he forgive us 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know) 
 And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know) 
 'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh 
 And I know he feel us, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause he be with us in the prisons 
 And he takes time to listen, uhh 
 God love us hood niggas (I know) 
 'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas 
 But he forgive us, uhh[Hook] 
 War is necessary, war brings pain 
 But war is necessary, war brings peace 
 ‘Cause war is necessary, get your warriors up 
 ‘Cause my niggas are war ready 
 War brings hate (Esco,  let's go let's go let's go!) 
 War is necessary, war brings pain (Esco, let's go!) 
 Get your warriors up 
 ‘Cause my niggas are war ready 
 My niggas war ready 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball 
 With the ability to make the issue stall 
 I told my man duck, ‘cause I know where the missile fall 
 ‘Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small 
 Went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall 
 I picked it up, his voice whispered, "Nigga, ball!" 
 So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?) 
 I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot 
 That resembles screen savers on your lap tops 
 And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop 
 I be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior 
 Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FILA velour's suits 
 Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke 
 Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a lawsuit 
 All true in living God, we was here first 
 Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts 
  
 [Repeat Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Whose crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters? 
 Times Square '88, whose crew was in it? 
 (Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs 
 40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares 
 Punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air 
 Hangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like "Bitch, come here" 
 Girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses 
 Like, "Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!" 
 We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad 
 Drug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad 
 They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men 
 But we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson 
 It was so simple, now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo 
 Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet 
 So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin' 
  
 [Repeat Hook][Intro: AZ] 
 Yea, yea, check it out 
 I see today's mathematics as being understanding, you know? 
 Understanding is having the ability to see things clearly 
 For what they are not what they present theyself to be 
 It completes the cipher, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's also symbolic to the black child which is the best part 
 Ayo, son, represent 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God 
 I try to beat trife odds, ride my L.E through the night fog and park 
 It's Buddha to be sparked, it's consistent 
 The beast smells the el because it travels long distance 
 Cruising in his Chrysler, pursuing niggas in my cipher 
 Start wildin' like insane asylum on Rikers Island 
 Verbal assassin, I murder freestylin' 
 One two for the gun crew, three drinking Cristal n 
 I play the side cause the words of man kill 
 Proverbs, buck out my grill, real as Ill Will, peep the steel 
 Nobody move nobody die, why must I be high? 
 Busting in trife bitches, touchin' mic switches 
 It's like a hot spoon of heroin, a Don like Perignon 
 Females love the guns I be wearing 
 Plant my seeds to live infinite, indeed in my sentences 
 I flow demandin', that's understandin' 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 850 Tempo but rugged like a Pinto 
 Chop shop hip-hop, burn the block intro 
 High priests release voodoo, déjà vu and this taboo 
 Illmatic shit and what have you 
 Chef cocaine cook, no brain got the proper diction 
 My competition bleeds words and weed blurs my vision 
 I'm freezing in time, stop the rhyme 
 I'm sober in stolen Range Rover much crime 
 I, stick up America, Nas in your area 
 Disrupt the sound barrier, clowns get pounds of terror 
 A full whip for more clips then Clint has in his era 
 Dirty Harry, cold black the uncanny, of Kojak 
 A Beretta sticking up trucks carrying amaretto 
 Clever to entice 'em, herbs I'm micin' while I'm pricin' 
 Niggas like they're slaves, best behave I'm the nice one 
 Nas, broken down for Nasir, means protection 
 Pop Dukes, resurrection international hoes, I'm sexin' 
 Or you'll be fucking one section, question? 
 Does a lonely mic give me an erection?, yes, son 
 On a float like the Jetsons futuristic rappin' mystic 
 Bust it, try and diss while my finger is on the iron biscuit 
 I rhyme terrific sparklin' like the diamond district 
 It's understanding[Verse 1] 
 Get yours nigga 
 'Cause I'ma get mine 
 In due time 
 Everybody gotta shine 
 Get yours, I spray nines 
 I say this one time 
 The last time, I swear to y'all 
 I'm from where 
 The dope fiends is at 
 And killers crawl 
 And snitches call police 
 On these niggas, and street 
 Corners everybody's like 
 Smokin' marijuana and 
 Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and 
 Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what 
 With the fo' pound go nuts 
 Better slow up 
 Before you get your ass sewn up 
 Nigga never gon' grow up 
 Drinkin' the Henny 
 But he know he gon' throw up 
 Tryin' to make crack sales 
 What it look like? Future for a black male 
 Don't want to make my momma cry 
 On a front page for a homicide 
 Fly whips, all I wanted to drive 
 Where chicks get blunted and ride 
 Do 105 in the fast lane 
 And a fast pace, chasin' the papes 
 Spendin' chips on big chains 
 And the dimes that give brains 
 That was a 80's and 90's thing 
 Now I'm into big things 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Gotta get my life together man 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I can't do that shit no more 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I can't fuck with you 
 I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners 
 I'm into big things 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 When I started this 
 All I wanted was cars and cribs 
 Like other rap artists but 
 Do I know where I'm goin' to? 
 Can I forget when I came from? 
 I be showin' you 
 Another style I'ma flow for you 
 Can I make somethin' wild 
 I can throw for you, flow for you 
 Make it bi-coastal 
 Take it to heights 
 That some of y'all can't come close to? 
 Some of y'all 
 Want to talk like hoes 
 Worse than bitches 
 And when y'all niggas see me blow 
 Bet it hurt like stitches 
 No competition 
 I stop and twist 'em 
 Hit 'em like a mafia proposition 
 I rap and y'all stop and listen 
 Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in 
 Look up at a nigga, now 
 Rocks that glisten 
 Can't stop my mission 
 Make another LP drop 
 I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive 
 No time to get caught up in a crime 
 I ain't have shit to do with 
 Used to chase the hoes 
 Now I chase the dough 
 Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper? 
 No! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you 
 Now I'm into big things (ill) 
 Gotta get my life together man (uh huh) 
 'Cause now I'm into big things (big things) 
 Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more) 
 'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all) 
 You know I can't do that shit no more (why?) 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?) 
 I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?) 
 I'm into big things (uh) 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I go past y'all (UH-HUH) 
 Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH) 
 And when I hit it, admit it 
 Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH) 
 We on the same team 
 You don't wanna pass the ball 
 Chuck and gunnin' for dough 
 You want to score 
 But you really don't know how to to ball 
 I put you on 
 It was me that introduced you to wealth 
 Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself 
 Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself 
 You ain't shit now 
 You was so ill, why you never came out? 
 Where ya clique now? 
 Where you sit now? In the back seat 
 Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat 
 Make you run laps like a pro athlete 
 And I done that 
 From my experiences 
 I appear relentless 
 Take more time 
 Just to hear my sentence 
 I'ma tell you what's real 
 And what could stop you from makin a mil' 
 You could prevent this 
 When niggas don't see eye to eye to you 
 Lie to you 
 Wanna get high with you 
 Want to eat food off of your labor 
 And take food off your table 
 'Cause they don't see your vision 
 Don't understand your mission 
 Is to make history 
 While you here 
 How long you plan on livin'? 
 Not for forever 
 At least to 140 
 Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat 
 Like the niggas who bought 
 Motown off Berry Gordy 
 Good God 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nigga I'm tired of games 
 I'm into big things 
 Gotta get my life together man 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things 
 Man we already did that 
 Now I'm into big things 
 No time to get sidetracked 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Get money now besides that 
 Some more big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield] 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)] 
 Yeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin' 
 Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange 
 Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it 
 You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it 
 For legal fees in the penal dorm 
 Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience 
 I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin' 
 Some dudes had just only a year of ballin' 
 Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence 
 (When the block is hot) 
 Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates 
 Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in 
 Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin' 
 (I gotta... when the block is hot) 
 I got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin' 
 Every five seconds look in all directions 
 I come through prepared, I give 'em a call 
 "I'm close, bring them guns downstairs" 
  
 [Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield (Nas)] 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down) 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)] 
 Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder 
 Two niggas dead, Tuesday 
 Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day 
 Friday, somebody-gotta-die day 
 Saturday, put the gat away 
 Chillin' with your chick and a bag of haze 
 Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way 
 'Cause Sunday back to gunplay 
 Most shit start over nothin' 
 And get finished quick ‘cause the art of repercussion 
 Yeah, I seen it, a G going out indecent (when the block is hot) 
 Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret 
 Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15 
 Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...) 
 My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die 
 But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die 
 You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty 
 But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his 40s 
  
 [Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield (Nas)] 
 I gotta hold down the block when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (yeah, word to mother) 
 I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation (yeah) 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)] 
 (I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob 
 A man rather die than live on his knees and starve 
 Cops steady askin' your man what happened 
 First he tell, then he stop, like he not really rattin' 
 Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off 
 (When the block is hot) 
 Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star 
 The rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot 
 Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop 
 The streets lie (when the block is hot), so you better be cautious 
 Your man'll fry you plus everybody talkin' 
 A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in 
 Make your own path, be a legend in your skin 
 (Hold down the block, when the block is hot) 
 Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin' 
 Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them 
 Queensbridge projects has taught him 
 And that's for life, you heard me right, I got the block 
  
 [Outro: Mark B. Mayfield] 
 When the block is hot, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation 
 I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot 
 I gotta use my imagination to change the situation[Intro: Nas] 
 I want y'all to see this like film 
 C-Sick on production, Nas on the vocal.. let's go 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Lots of fog at night, red brake lights 
 The freeway beside a restaurant 
 Cold egg whites sat on my plate like 
 3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men 
 I'm high on hemp 
 A fly old pimp just walked in, his suit was shark skin 
 He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in 
 What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness 
 Friends to fiends for the audience screams, ridiculous 
 Jumped up, paid my tab, got in my Benz and went 
 To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends 
 Some show love and some are envious 
 Some got the heart of gold, some venomous 
 At times I wanna go back to being penniless 
 Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent 
 Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again 
 And all is real so all's worth mentioning 
  
 [Hook: Ultra Naté (sampled)] 
 If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness 
 Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with 
 Memories real, still ill, now I appear crisp like film 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs 
 Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose 
 Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals 
 Car doors rise with no touch of the handles 
 Capiche? Caprese salad’s on beaches and islands 
 Far from police sirens at least for a weekend 
 Then it's back to the streets creepin 
 I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behalf of this nigga speaking 
 Add a splash to the Seagrams 
 Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening 
 As I circle the table like Babe Ruth 
 Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude 
 Bat to the brain with brute force 
 Splatter my cream velour suit 
 They hit me with lawsuit 
 I slip in your whore coupe 
 Your bitch hate you, word to Jesus 
 Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew 
 OGs hate to make way for the new 
 Young niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew 
 It's safe to say I was once young and innocent 
 But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I speak to the street life 
 The executive chief types 
 The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right 
 The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras 
 Cuz I barely survived crazy eras 
 Honest, always make good on my promise 
 I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it 
 I was born to this life I didn't invent it 
 But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets 
 You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs 
 Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats 
 Either you like beef, or you like to spectate 
 Give me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say 
 We touch em and we come out tussling 
 The ghetto is my garden of eden 
 So I keep bobbin' and weavin' 
 It's intense so I'm hardly breathing 
 KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends 
  
 [Hook][Intro] (Nas) 
 Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz... 
 Come on man... Let's do this 
 It's a Braveheart party y'all 
 C'mon 
  
 [Hook] (Mary) 
 Throw your hands up cuz we wanna dance 
 Don't be afraid just take a chance 
 Cuz this beat will rock your body 
 Get up on the floor and party 
 Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do 
 Thinkin' while I have a drink or two 
 Throw your hands up everybody 
 Get up on the floor and party 
  
 [Verse 1] (Nas) 
 I move at night, respect my gangsta 
 Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right 
 The club is righteous, tight with family 
 Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties 
 Ladies who's sexually free 
 And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty 
 Middle fingers up and say "Fuck the world" 
 Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl 
 And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal 
 Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down 
 Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out 
 Put yo hands up 
  
 Repeat Chorus 
  
 [Verse 2] (Jungle) 
 I pull in a V12 drop all red 
 Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg 
 Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you 
 Show you what your body made for, you're official 
 You could be my baby mama lookin like that 
 What you drink, champagne or Cognac 
 What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana 
 Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada 
 A nigga like Jungle to always come thru 
 Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to 
 Cause I'mma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB 
 Put'em up... 
  
 Repeat Chorus 
  
 Party all night (Party all night) 
 Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights) 
 Party all night (Whachu wan' do?) 
 Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...) 
  
 [Verse 3] (Wiz) 
 I'm blaze, haze for days 
 Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid 
 Mac out corner I got it's all laid 
 Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face 
 Now do she want me to touch her? 
 Or do she want me to see? 
 Fuck is she comin wit me 
 A true BHG Wiz, not complex 
 Chin checks if it get hectic 
 Nigga Braveheart respected 
 Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it 
 And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case 
 I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face 
 Throw yo hands up 
  
 Repeat Chorus 2X[Hook] 
 I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with 
 And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch 
 Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch 
 There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch 
 Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this? 
 The makings of a perfect bitch 
  
 [Nas] 
 A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife 
 I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper 
 Mad niggas in this one predicament 
 You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it 
 My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin' 
 Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing 
 So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man 
 A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand 
 And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her 
 I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker 
 I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League 
 Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee 
 What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef 
 Say goodbye to the stress 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever 
 These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better 
 Four cycles of blood, child birth first 
 Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death 
 That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth 
 Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef 
 Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh 
 Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess 
 If she survives she'll be sucking me next 
 Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do 
 My taxes for the IRS 
 So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed 
 I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god 
 Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart 
 Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death 
 I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets 
 Like Billie Holiday in Harlem 
 Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms 
 Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan 
 Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit 
 Helping me load clips 
 Some words form a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist" 
 But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses 
 All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect 
 But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie 
 Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen 
 They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists 
 The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit 
 Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy 
 Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage 
 Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car 
 All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight 
 Homeboy bumpin' my old shit 
 They wildin' with some freaks from the islands 
 Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz 
 He shouted, "Nas, roll with us" 
 I'm bored so I followed him 
 Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins 
 He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins 
 Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend 
 I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything 
 Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove 
 War stories about dudes both of us know 
 Never heard drunken words spoken so slow 
 A year go by, the nigga was fly 
 Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high 
 Got a call, he's in N.Y 
 Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by 
 For a season where he's at 
 Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that" 
 Next week got a call from his wife 
 Said somebody done took son life 
 *beat changes* 
 She said 
  
 [Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X] 
 "Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now 
 Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now? 
 Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down? 
 Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now" 
  
 [Nas as Scarlett] 
 Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude 
 Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou 
 H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road 
 Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain 
 My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up 
 Arrangement's a closed casket 
 See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang 
 Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it 
 Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian 
 Brag about how the streets needed a changin' 
 Son, you the only one a bitch could call 
 You remind me of my dude, help me get them all 
  
 Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X* 
 Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all" 
 Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X* 
 Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"[John Lennon] 
 Imagine there's no heaven 
 It's easy if you try 
 No hell below us 
 Above us, only sky 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living for today 
  
 [Rap Verse 1: Nas] 
 Imagine we could all get along 
 Won't be long 
 Til that day comes 
 Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons 
 Father, stop lookin' at every sports station 
 Take a second 
 And think of every poor nation 
 Making weapons 
 They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare 
 Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare 
 Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad 
 How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous 
 How do we escape these brainless acts of terror 
 I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better 
 Put our hearts in the right place 
 Humans of all colors 
 We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day 
 Imagine that 
  
 [John Lennon] 
 Imagine there's no countries 
 It isn't hard to do 
 Nothing to kill or die for 
 And no religion, too 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living life in peace 
  
 [Hook: John Legend] 
 You may say I'm a dreamer 
 But I'm not the only one 
 I hope someday you'll join us 
 And the world will be as one 
  
 [Rap Verse 2: Pitbull] 
 America, the 
 Land of the free 
 America, the 
 Land of opportunity 
 America 
 What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty 
 If you turnin' refugees, back at sea 
 Music was made to move them 
 Even the devil he dances 
 I got a lot of questions 
 And I'm searching for answers 
 We taught to believe in religion, but religion's 
 The reason the Twin Towers are missin' 
 Listen 
 That was the past, but maybe now, you realize 
 The man above us the only thing 
 That keeps us alive 
 We breathe the same air 
 We bleed the same blood 
 Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love) 
  
 [John Lennon] 
 Imagine no possessions 
 I wonder if you can 
 No need for greed or hunger 
 A brotherhood of man 
 Imagine all the people 
 Sharing all the world 
  
 [Repeat Hook][Intro] 
 To my niggas 
 To my niggas 
 What! What! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Looking back in time, when I had on my shine 
 I saw you standing there 
 I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol 
 Why did you have to take it there 
 But then again, it was just my imagination 
 When my crew told me it was you that was player hating 
 Then we had to have that terrible confrontation 
 There's nothing I can do to help this situation... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me) 
 Niggas wanna get at me 
 Stay scheming 
 Niggas wanna get at me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Its been awhile since the last time we hung out 
 Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out 
 Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips 
 And ho I'm with, glad who see she with 
 Shorty with the don 
 Me and horse switch cars 
 Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par 
 Thug nigga never thought I get this far 
 Who is that icing me from over there in the fog? 
 You got the mack god, you got the gat par 
 Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god 
 Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard 
 My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward 
 So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit 
 I'm for the love of it 
 Stubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip 
 Can't even chill cause niggas just 
  
 [Hook] 
 Stay scheming 
 Niggas wanna get at me 
 Stay scheming 
 Niggas wanna kidnap me 
  
 [Outro] 
 But they never do it motherfuckers...[Intro: Busta Rhymes] 
 Ay fellas 
 I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one 
 Ay ladies 
 Put the petroleum jelly on your face 
 Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round 
 Get them! 
  
 [Verse One: Nas] 
 Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts 
 Got paper but I'm lost 
 Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for? 
 My seed is straight, the family's settled 
 Idle time get the man in trouble 
 When wifey tourin', my life get borin' 
 Start to remember all types of torment 
 The devil's callin', but I don't answer 
 Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind 
 Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines 
 Next to me in the Phantom, who lying? 
 Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin 
 Dada, trying to stay away from creeps 
 With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets 
 War stories, funerals 
 Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying 
 Body viewings, at the wake 
 Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket 
 With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky 
 Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci 
 I'm above the standard 
 But dudes is more zealous than Branford 
 Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya 
 Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters 
 Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips 
 Cause real niggas die over dumb shit 
 Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips 
 Cause real niggas die over dumb shit 
  
 [Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes] 
 Fight, fists, dance, sucker 
 Suicide, bounce, brother 
 Ice, whips, cash, nigga 
 Watch your, big, ass, momma 
  
 [Verse Two: Nas] 
 To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous 
 Y'all the antithesis, the opposite 
 Twitching shit, all up in your body language 
 Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over 
 To look closer, told you: "Y'all sloppy gangsters", saying: 
 "Nas is this, and Nas is that" 
 Your eyes go front, your eyes go back 
 Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at 
 It's obvious you don't know how I react 
 Like, I don't know where the party's at 
 You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath 
 Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed 
 Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it 
 Two to the head, four to the stomach 
 Call more security because, I come off 
 Anywhere you at, you scary cats 
 If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain 
 A thousand times harder, than when I first came 
 Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb 
 And y'all just forgot about the consequences 
 Not a jail sentence, but see 
 The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me 
 We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys 
 Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning 
 I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food 
 And say: "That's the way you kill a man 
 Avoid the shooting", hey {*echo* x4} 
  
 [Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes] 
 Fight, fists, dance, sucker 
 Suicide, bounce, brother 
 Ice, whips, cash, nigga 
 Watch your, big, ass, momma 
  
 [Outro: Quan, (Busta Rhymes)] 
 You smile, in my face 
 Secretly I know, you want my place 
 You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe 
 Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me 
 But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping 
 And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe 
 Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin 
 And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe

 Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine, Nas Is Like 
 Love Undying, Money's My Bitch in Thugz Mansion 
 Thugs dancin' around the fly shit 
 Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders 
 Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles 
 Money, jewelry want me then come get me 
 Hit me but don't miss me, you history 
 Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me 
 This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty 
 Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me 
 Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo 
 Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though 
 My big bro told me plain and simple, "Nas do not look back" 
 Watch where you took rap, no bookbags and trucker hats 
 Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin' 
 What the fuck is that, freestyle

 And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters 
 Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real 
 Get a smack in your face, cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama 
 Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence 
 If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it 
 Then dress warm for the cemetery climate 
 When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror 
 See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer 
 Hand straight gleamin', if I don't know you toe-tag you 
 Drag you through the cement, fo-fo maggie 
 Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar 
 While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that 
 Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs 
 All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion? 
 Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards 
 Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness 
 Hell yeah, awareness is my alias 
 Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest 
 The realest, HERE IT IS!

 Newscaster: "Recently there has been an emergence of socially 
 Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be 
 A new trend in the Hip-Hop world." 
  
 *DJ scratches sample* {'Nas is a rebel to America!'}3X* 
 (Yeah, check it, uh) 
  
 [Vers 1: Nas] 
 Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa 
 Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya 
 Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka 
 Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer 
 Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars 
 Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue? 
 I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew 
 What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to? 
 You ain't got the ghetto with you 
 Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse 
 Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about 
 The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect 
 Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh 
 We ain't got no choices who to choose 
 Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices 
 And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites 
 Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick 
 Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools 
 About poor children, then she gotta prove that she 
 Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool 
 Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules 
 Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused 
 Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose 
 Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry 
 On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey 
 You MCs on that old slavery path 
 The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh 
 See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves 
 Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells 
 It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win 
 Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh 
  
 [Hook: Kelis] 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin 
 Israeli men conversatin' on ends 
 Probably businessmen, I sense good taste 
 And they watch us, the spots an expensive place 
 Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin' 
 It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening 
 This man leans in, his boys laughing 
 Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens 
 Since all Black women care about is who got dough 
 And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho 
 I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold 
 Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go 
 The biggest example in scandal of history 
 Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree 
 Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci 
 Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies 
 But who are we to blame, not the dames 
 It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same 
 Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth 
 So they deserve the Hermes purse 
 Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime 
 Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh 
  
 [Hook: Kelis] 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit 
  
 [Verse 3: Kelis] 
 I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay 
 I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid 
 Who even cares about the president? 
 I think we're making a mistake 
 I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe 
 I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh) 
  
 [Kelis] 
 Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight 
 Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh) 
 Can we make a change 
 You know it's not overnight 
 Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah) 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way 
  
 {'Nas is a rebel to America!'}[Intro: Raye] 
 Oh yeah-yeah 
 Oh-na-na-na, uhm 
  
 [Raye] 
 Concrete bricks, bullet proof vests 
 I'm proud of these walls that I built to defend 
 And protect this bold heart 
 This bold heart 
 But the way you marched into my home 
 Not few, big army 
 With the weapon on your arm 
 Yes, you struck straight with your cold heart 
 Your cold heart 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I'm like Nat, I'm like Nat 
 I'm a man of God but where is Christ at? 
 And even though my name is Nas I am like Nat 
 Is this me declaring war? White flags 
 I now know why I was even born 
 To strike back 
 A full moon up in the sky, that's a sign that 
 It's time to get my liberation, the perfect configuration 
 It's the birth of a nation, midwife black 
 Mother father, caucasian 
 My blood Indian, native 
 So now I'm contemplating being like Nat 
 'Bout to show you what I'm made of 
 I'm what racists are afraid of 
 No mule and the 40 acres 
 And despite that 
 Watch out for the traitors 
 When they say make America great again, do they mean make us all slaves again? 
 Don't be sidetracked 
  
 [Hook: Raye] 
 Is this you declaring war? 
 No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag 
 So you think I'm gonna run now? 
 No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back 
 This is me declaring war 
 This is me declaring war, war 
 This is me declaring war, war 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Don't want to be a victim no more 
 Depicted as a criminal, especially when you're poor 
 Why doesn't the government order capital punishment 
 To officers 
 Who racial profile and put slugs in us 
 Makes me think they want us extinct 
 On the brink of insanity 
 We screaming for justice, they sending tanks, the man in me 
 Demand we protect the family, anarchy 
 Ku-Klux-Klan and him demanding he damage me 
 So my fantasy is every single one of us 
 Come against the evil divide of people, it's common sense 
 The fury, I hope the whole world hear me 
 No justice, so I became a revolutionary 
 No matter if you're red, white, black 
 If you want freedom then we're all like Nat 
  
 [Hook: Raye] 
 Is this you declaring war? 
 No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag 
 So you think I'm gonna run now? 
 No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back 
 This is me declaring war 
 This is me declaring war, war 
 This is me declaring war, war 
  
 [Outro] 
 Dear America, it's time for a better America 
 There's a little Nat Turner in every one of us 
 No matter if you're red, white, black 
 If you want freedom then we're all like Nat 
 War, war (war), war, war 
 Declare war 
 It's time 
 Let the spirit of Nat Turner live forever[Intro] 
 Uh, yeah turn it up, check it out 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The transition from a young fool 
 Broke, still on his neck, he hung jewels 
 Live his life in the ghetto where guns rule 
 It was cool wasn't mad, I had to take out cabs 
 Made my first LP afforded H-Class, my face gassed 
 '94, Sold out in every record store 
 Local hood rats who wouldn't speak 
 Now I'm who they're checking for 
 Shown crazy love, ran up on stage with 80 thugs 
 After the shows, my niggas robbed the bar and wrecked the clubs 
 Happy, no hating, more henny, more blunts circulating 
 My single in rotation on every radio station 
 Eyes popped when I drove my first ride on the block 
 Summertime, block parties, cookouts, I spend my knot 
 Truly, niggas was fighting over who was closely to me 
 Happy with the new representative of QB 
 To hit the top first you have to gotta fall before you make it 
 With for 4 minutes of your time, watch me demonstrate it

 [Verse 2] 
 Cayman Islands in the winter, summer bus rides to Great Adventure 
 I've brung New York back to real rap inventors 
 New crib, diamond rings, killers on my team 
 Infinitis for my girl for giving birth to my queen 
 3 g's worth of chronic a week, promoters were mad 
 I stopped doing shows to spend time in the street 
 Loot declined, eventually so did my shine 
 Repo looking for my Lex, back then I wasn't buying 
 You can guess niggas started saying, with all the success 
 "Why is your mom still in the projects?" I answered them vexed 
 Fuck out my face, pistol in my car, full clip 
 I read about Pablo Escobar and got on some shit 
 So called mans would plot on my chips, I was fronting 
 Niggas thought I was rich and got mad cause they was pumpin' 
 My assumption, niggas want me pumped in the casket 
 Kept the gun the same three-fifth a nigga got bagged with

 [Verse 3] 
 Caught a case now, I'm home staring off into space 
 Flashbacks of all the jewelry, cars, crossing my face 
 Rappers I met, hoes on video cassette 
 No management, no more good life and no respect 
 Hearing crowds roar, crystal pouring mixed drinks 
 Haunted by the thoughts of second album sophomore jinx 
 Where did I fail? Death threats, woke up in cold sweats 
 Thinking about all these murders that know where I rest 
 From hanging with crazy cliques that's known to take shit 
 Bracelets, and all that beef now I'm involved, was paperless 
 My cars were auctioned off, now I catch rides with kidnap-niggas 
 Who snatch babies up to get back figures 
 Lessons from heaven, every night I slept with my weapon 
 To guard my family for a minute I forgot my profession 
 Not from Columbia or Nicaragua 
 Don't distribute coke from Antigua, that shipped out to Panama 
 Pablo Escobar's bloody reign came to an end 
 Far from my life; a kid who made his fame from a pen 
 Hit the studio and change the game again 
 Wrote down all the pain within, top of the charts, triple platinum 
 Got the fake love back, money stacks, more plaques 
 Had to see who I was just to know where I was at 
 Saw both sides of the game, all the ups and downs 
 This goes out to the future rap kings coming up now

 But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo 
 Check it out, check it out how it went 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright 
 Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights 
 Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls 
 Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off 
 In the loft, mixing hash and dro 
 Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass 
 Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast 
 When the phone ring, the house lights flash 
 Turned down the sound, let's get down to business 
 Shit about to go down with some foul niggas 
 What the voice said, "What up, pop? Who want it?" 
 I put the guap up, get the boy popped 
 He say "Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin' 
 Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'" 
 Dog, why you callin' me? This our food 
 You handle the mouths that it trickles down to 
 Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too 
 But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich 
 Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico 
 He said "It IS Rico, of all people 
 Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor 
 To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather" 
 Said the nigga shot up my cars 
 Last night he laid for me to come out my doors? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
 You can't kill me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass 
 Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half 
 You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, Balderdash 
 I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on 
 The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don 
 What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah 
 Packed the 9's, yo this nigga's asinine 
 Smack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom 
 In a casket, you'll get your fashion on 
 You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die 
 You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas 
 Remember anyone can get it at anytime 
 Lames'll swear by your name, when they lie 
 Get hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are 
 So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1? 
 In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser 
 Merk you wit your own shooters 
 All you want is a name, pissed and insane 
 My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen 
 Then it goin' off, start spittin' 
 Niggas try to bring it where I live in 
 Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at 
 So we waited with the Sigs, blat, blat, blat! 
  
 [Hook] 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
 Niggas always on that bullshit 
 Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
 You can't kill me 
  
 {*"You can't kill me" to fade*}{*speaking softly, gradually getting louder*} 
  
 Turn my headphones up, it's pure 
 Nuttin' gonna stop me now, Stillmatic 
 Tye Fyfe remix, you know? 
 (I'm here now, we here, it's your world) 
 Ill Will y'all 
  
 Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage 
 One person front, my face on the front page 
 Only if I had one love, one girl and one crib 
 One God to show me how to do things his son did 
 Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with 
 151, one sip'll probably make me flip 
 See my name in the hieroglyphs, like Osiris and Isis 
 Parables written inside papyruses 
 Ackowledge it, we been all tricked time to come out of it 
 Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us 
 Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin' us 
 One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up 
 But my luck, I got up, the cop (shot) again 
 Bus stop, glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken 
 Richochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in 
 Blackin' out as I duck back, forget gettin' hit! {*more sirens*} 
 This is my hood I'mma rep, to the death of it 
 'til everybody come home, little brothers is grown 
 Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon 
 Sent from the star sun and the moon 
 In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers 
 Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors 
 IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO FLY, WITH MIND POWER 
 THIS IS WHAT NAS IS 'BOUT, BROTHERS THE TIME IS NOW! 
  
 {*whispering again*} 
 Yo, all I need is one mic.. 
 All I need is one mic.. that's all I need 
 All I need is one mic.. all I need 
 All I need is one mic.. yeah 
  
 {*gradually getting louder*} 
 All I need is one cup, one page, and one pen 
 One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin 
 Matter fact maybe more than one 
 Look back at all the hatred against me, touch alla them 
 Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three (shots) 
 From twin (Glocks) there's sixteen a piece, that's thirty-two 
 Which means, one of my dunns was holdin 17 
 Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you 
 Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral 
 Never get caught up, pain'll go through the innocent 
 Nothin' is fair, brothers roll up, (shootin') from wheelchairs 
 My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air 
 I let this all slide for too many years, too many times 
 Now I'm strapped with a couple of (macs), too many (nines) 
 If y'all people really wit me get busy load up the (semis) 
 Do more than just hold it explode the (clip) until you empty 
 There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush 
 (Lead) flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut 
 THAT WE TAKE THESE DUDES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN 
 CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY PEOPLES THE TIME IS NOW!! 
  
 {*whispering again*} 
 All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need 
 All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin' else in the world 
 All I need is one mic.. that's all a (nigga) need to do his thing y'know 
 All I need is one mic.. 
  
 {*starting loud this time, getting quieter*} 
 ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'm ONE MAN 
 WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND 
 Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical 
 Talkin all that slick stuff, while my name is biblical 
 Wonder what my secrets is, enemies'll move on you 
 Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none 
 Too late I'm mad young I'm laughin' cause I'm a cool brother 
 Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you brothers 
 What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin' 
 War gets deep, some beef is everlastin' 
 Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin' each other 
 Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start? 
 You know the block was ill as a youngster 
 Every night it was like a, (cop) would get killed body found in the dumpster 
 For real a hustler, purchased my Range, people throwin dirt on my name 
 Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain 
 Women left me cause they thought I was finished 
 Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence 
 Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes 
 Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight 
 Swellin' my melon cause none of these brothers real 
 Heard they were, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal? 
 This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found 
 You need some soul searchin', the time is now 
  
 All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, (fuck) cash 
 All I need is one mic.. (fuck) the cars, the jewelry 
 All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world[Intro: Nas (Ron Isley sample)] 
 Good morning, yeah 
 (Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Good morning, the same old jerks goin' to work 
 Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp 
 There's this nice lady I know, she always speak 
 With her two children, headed to the school building 
 Then rush home again to lit housin' 
 And they are puttin' out the new ceilings 
 Cause her shits is leakin' 
 Water keep drippin' down, so she beefin' 
 Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin' 
 Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in' 
 So they drive around all-day with bench warrants 
 Eatin' donuts and sippin' on coffee 
 Ooops! Sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie 
 "Damn, this nigga is a creep" 
 Whispers the police at the Wino in the middle of the street 
 With missin' front teeth twistin' blunts deep in the cut 
 It's my nigga so I holla what up, niggas good morning 
  
 [Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)] 
 Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah) 
 I didn't get a wake-up call from out there 
 (Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah) 
 So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson 
 And only live by God's blessing 
  
 Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah) 
 I didn't get a wake-up call from out there 
 (Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah) 
 So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson 
 And only live by God's blessing, good morning 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Good morning, yawnin', dawn is now gone and 
 New day, toothpaste brushin' my screwface 
 Follow the light, it's just a great feelin' 
 And I love life, every minute is pure healin' 
 Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays 
 No more child play, livin' life the foul way 
 My man just came home speedin' 
 Tryin' to catch up with 9 years of no freedom 
 The paper say, "They finally caught him" 
 He back in, I guess street life got too borin' 
 Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep 
 If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street 
 Put on my 'lands and, leave the Phantom 
 Take the low-whip for a trip up to Pan Pan's 
 Scramble egg whites and turkey bacon 
 "Ma, pass the hot sauce from out your apron" 
 Uh, good morning 
  
 [Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)] 
 Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah) 
 I didn't get a wake-up call from out there 
 (Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah) 
 So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson 
 And only live by God's blessing 
  
 Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah) 
 I didn't get a wake-up call from out there 
 (Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah) 
 So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson 
 And only live by God's blessing, good morning

 Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah 
 Yeah, yeah well, well[Intro]

 Oh woe woe 
 Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now 
 Hey hey hey hey 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 In the papers you read that Nas is crazy 
 Lost his mind as he leavin' Sony 
 The INC got him signed 
 It's only a figment of your imagination 
 Went to way with New York's Hot radio station 
 Lost my patience, had to Zone Out 
 Rappers blown out, I have the throne now 
 The real shall reign, I feel your pain 
 You too R&B, follow me, spell my name

 God's Son across the belly 
 Pardon, I'm hardly a bully 
 But what y'all done to hip hop is scary 
 Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with 
 Holdin it down, my proteges are over with now 
 A producer like Swizz Beatz, on fire 
 So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down 
 Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children 
 So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin'

 [Verse 1] 
 I slow dance with the Devil 
 Snow setting in the bezzle 
 Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville 
 Polo black scented, eyes squinted 
 Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it 
 Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy 
 Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality 
 Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green 
 Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens 
 With no AKs, I'm the ambassador 
 Robin Hood in the Aston Mart 
 Lot of blood gon' splash in war 
 Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass 
 But y'all ain't never seen nothing 
 Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench 
 That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate 
 Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent 
 To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit 
 Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick 
 The big Benz, I'ma model ya chick 
 With Zac Posen, cash froze her 
 Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over 
 Cold like ice, more chains than slaves 
 Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel 
 Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble 
 I could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where them gangsters at? 
 Where them dimes at? 
 Where where them gangsters at? 
 Where them dimes at?

 [Verse 2] 
 The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya 
 If you stand close to the woofer 
 Betcha get sprayed by my lecture 
 Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular 
 Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya 
 Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac 
 Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that 
 Eat with my elbows top of the table 
 Street etiquette with speech impediments 
 And still see presidents, no matter who paid 
 Cause you ain't take the last dollar made 
 Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it 
 Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate 
 Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung' 
 Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from 
 Q-Boro, specifically The Bridge 
 Don't ask no more questions, y'all know what it is 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where them gangsters at? 
 Where them dimes at? 
 Where where them gangsters at?

 Where where them dimes at? 
 Where where them dimes at? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking 
 Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic 
 My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what 
 Financier, skull doo wrapped up 
 Mob life, prizefights, plasma TV's or first roll 
 Diversified dough in my circle 
 Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness 
 Numero uno, annuit coeptis 
 That's the language of our Latin ancestors 
 On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message 
 In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria 
 My criteria, smoke cigars 
 Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock and Roll 
 With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing 
 Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket 
 Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where them gangsters at? 
 Where them dimes at? 
 Where where them gangsters at? 
 Where them dimes at?

 [Hook:] 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed 
 They wanna shine on 'em 
 Shine on 'em 
 Shine on 'em 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland 
 Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand 
 Illegal smugglin', people strugglin' 
 Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again 
 Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade 
 Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed 
 Forced in the army, young killer brigade 
 Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued 
 Till his mind can't take what he's going through 
 Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue 
 Then the royal family the ice go to 
 And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed 
 As I rap with my platinum chain 
 When you shop for me you think about the misery? 
 The same way we made apartheid history 
 We can do the same way to the conflict ice 
 But everybody wanna shine right? 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist 
 I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest 
 The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty 
 And the whole world ignores the robbery 
 Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me 
 Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity 
 It shocks so many are killed annually 
 Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity 
 Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it 
 Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded 
 Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive 
 Husbands separated from wives 
 Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly 
 But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Outro:] 
 Incomprehensible singing[Intro: Eban Thomas] 
 It is absolutely silly, and unproductive 
 To have a funeral for the word "nigga" 
 When the actions continue.. 
 We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters 
 Not a funeral for niggers 
 Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*} 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 Uh, yeah.. 
 Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet 
 I be drinkin' from your spit, anything cause I'm all less 
 An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead 
 Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed 
 Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food 
 Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool 
 The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to 
 Fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath 
 Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of 
 Your pesticide or RAID cause, in heaven's my Creator 
 I love it when the light's off, eatin' from same knives, forks 
 From, ANY man's dinner, see my antennas 
 You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make 
 If you squash me, learn to live with me 
 How much your roach motel costin' you in the city? 
 But yo, we everywhere! Check your house good, I bet we there! 
 LOOK THERE! 
  
 [Outro: Eban Thomas] 
 Niggers are like roaches - they're never gonna go away 
 Learn from them what we should not become 
 Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}[Cormega](Nas) 
  
 Ayo check this out son 
 This is my man Nas Escobar 
 And I go by the name of Cormega you know

 Yo check this out on the real son 
 Anybody diss the Firm yo on the real yo

 Son you gonna set it? set it son 
 Matter of fact though 
  
 [Nas] 
  
 I peep you frontin, I was in the Jeep 
 Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin' 
 Across the street you was wildin' 
 Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine 
 Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine 
 I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him 
 What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time 
 Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him 
 So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb 
 Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son 
 Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come 
 Then they came askin me my name, what the ugh 
 I got stitched up and went through 
 Left the hospital that same night, what 
 Got my gat back, time to backtrack 
 I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped 
 Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by 
 It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one 
 That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew 
  
 I can't believe it achieve 
 Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever 
  
 [Cormega] 
 Pushin' a red lex 
 With many screams inside the headsets 
 So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet 
 I keep red tech in the passenger seat 
 To match their heat 
 It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep 
 It's on the kid 
 Whoever gets his first 
 It's going to kids dirt 
 My soldiers be cold blooded vultures 
 And cold blooded 
 Yo on the street we control hundreds 
 I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted 
 Your man froze when I rolled up 
 I symbolize death like a cobra 
 Attacks your life here it's over 
 Black you effed up 
 Never should've messed up 
 My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck 
 You know my steelo im like Al Pacino 
 Yo Nas Escobar grab the mic and flex a bar 
  
 [Nas] 
 I'm in the black limo 
 Jack Daniel through the crack window 
 I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu 
 Grab the symbol 
 Show examples to make examples 
 Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew 
 Firm affiliation paper chasing 
 Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano 
 Sophisticano 
 Yo blazing halos like shadow 
 Yo nigga im the castro 
 Im coming through on your wack crew 
 What you gonna do 
 Cormega pick the mic come through 
  
 [Cormega] 
  
 Ay yo I get mines 
 Well enough to be considered big time 
 My crew a chosen few legit minds 
 Who live prime 
 Shorty's on some fly stuff 
 Admitted that can't resist mines 
 Mahogany complexion 
 Body probably dressed in 
 My ill tommy hill collection 
 When I be flexin', sketch it 
 My selection of words are type effective 
 When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present 
 In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on 
 Recite nice on mics strike like a python 
 My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on 
 My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming 
 Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt 
 Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming 
 Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon 
 Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo 
 The narcs go knocked my man Marco 
 His money was marked yo 
 I regulate a sharp flow 
 But in my life bucaso 
 My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo 
 I symbolize rive alive niggas 
 Ghetto's where I live 
 Considered my rhyme the oasis 
 Because rap was a desert 
 And I helped minds escaped it 
 Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet 
  
 [Nas] 
  
 Fake thug, no love 
 You get the slug, CB4 Gusto 
 Your luck low 
 I didn't know til I was drunk though 
 You freak cats get played out 
 Get robbed and laid out 
 Prostitute turned snitch 
 I got the gauge out 
 96 ways I made out, Montana way 
 The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray 
 Dipped attache, jumped out the Range 
 Empty out the ashtray 
 A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay 
 Red dot plots, thirty-two shots 
 Ya'll niggas don't want none of this 
  
 [Cormega] 
  
 Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs 
 My man Georgie is lounging downstairs 
 My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge 
 And all you real cats know what time it is 
 On the real all you crabs cats know the deal 
 On the real all you crabs cats know the deal 
 On the real all you crabs cats know the deal 
 Now check the new verse 
 Check the new verse it's ill 
 Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner 
 Pain digital wood brain material 
 Rims spin sinister 
 Grin like John Dillinger 
 Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya 
 Misery and jealousy when you envision me 
 I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me 
 You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin' 
 My baby face ice grill I heard something for real 
 In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper 
 I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers 
 Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know 
 People we dope like mafiaso like gambino 
 Where Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino 
 I like sony cause they saw my man keeno 
 Can't forget my home girl Faith Newman 
 She be boomin' 
 My people they representing 
 Every percent in 
 In my firm team 
 We so ill our people burn cream 
 Rhymes I design 
 Can make your mind turn fiend

 For keepin Queen regulatin'

 You know my style son we in here ye ye

 Straight out the bridge peace to my man Havoc

 Life is real a lot of trife things be happening 
 I love yall kids I love my whole mobb deep fam 
 It's real like that you know life has tied me man 
 Yo I lived the life of 62 pick ups 
 Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups 
 Seeing events in which you have to stay silent 
 Murder extortion and all types of violence 
 Yo kids living a life ghetto heaven 
 Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens 
 You know my style 
 You can't stop what knocks me down 
 Peace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown 
 My whole firm team is ill no doubt 
 I can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute 
 With the ill benz 
 He rocks the ill dimes and ill rims 
 You know my steelo 
 I'm like Al Pacino 
 God bless the life of my man nino 
  
 [Nas] 
  
 It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple" 
 Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in 
 Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit 
 Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick 
 Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung 
 Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue 
 It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer 
 The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia 
 The cognac plurger plus the trees 
 But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze 
 And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype 
 Used to be a general but just lost his stripe 
 Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers 
 Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject 
 I love teks let's get it off 
 Yo what up what up 
  
 [Cormega] 
  
 Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex 
 I wear my guests in apendix 
 And cash my cheque in flesh shit 
 My man escobar be lighting a weed 
 And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need 
 I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man 
 Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam 
 My man Nas is down with me 
 A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me 
 It's like that, you know it's like that 
 We'll strike back Queensbridge style 
 My mobb deep people is mad foul 
 A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit 
 I get my money numerous occasions 
 It's frequent my man Ike 
 Tried to avalanche ice watch 
 You know my steelo Al Pacino 
 Yo Escobar 
  
 [Nas/Cormega] 
 Escobar season 
 Cormega 4 reason 
 We with it what 
 I'll stay high triple beamin 
 Queensbridge[Verse 1: Nas] 
 I had a dream I was a gangster, drinkin' Moets, holdin' Tecs 
 Makin' sure the cash is correct, then I stepped 
 Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks 
 Winnin' gun fights with the cops 
 Custom-made suits, hands full of ice and gold 
 Makin' thousand dollar bets on the dice I rolled 
 Girls workin' night patrol, the whore market 
 When I walk, niggas is rollin' out the red carpet 
 Now, how good could a black man have it? 
 Livin' like a king is a habit, I keep an automatic 
 The whole crew life is love above word 
 Rumors about the way we make niggas well heard 
 Nicknamed the "Killa Clan", soon to kill a man 
 If there's still a gram, I shake my left hand 
 And not do a minute on the rock 
 'Cause if I do a minute on the rock, the juries gettin' knocked 
 About girls I kept braggin' 
 'Cause I owned all the runner-ups in every state's beauty pageant 
 Inside my Lamborghini, pour you a Martini 
 Little kids in the streets, they wanna be me 
 I'm livin' in a mansion, hold a nigga's wife for ransom 
 I'm like a rich Charles Manson 
 A view, backyard, about 40 acres 
 You read about me in the papers 
 I hit the jackpot every night from all my crack spots 
 We attack cops for props 
 I got sons with guns, they all done crimes 
 They so wild, they even scare my ass sometimes 
 Other niggas on the blocks is so corny 
 I got my dime, I'm lookin like someone smoke for me 
 Bad bitches kissin' my ass 
 I got a few mill in the stash with beds made of cash 
 But on my head was a price 
 I made the bad-guys in Miami-Vice look nice 
 All of a sudden, I got raided, my crib was invaded 
 But, the Nas still made it ... 
 ... To the getaway car 
 And now my drivin' skills gotta be up to par 
 The cops parked the car and sprayed till it was smoked up 
 That's when I woke up 
  
 [Hook: Piano hook] 
  
 [Jungle] 
 Yea Nas, nigga 
 Word Life Kid 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The whole thing was a nightmare 
 I fell asleep watchin' Scarface, layin' in the chair 
 Standin' on the block, it was flooded with cops 
 Through the parks was the D's and the Narcs 
 Watchin' me walkin' out my buildin 
 Starin' and hawkin shit, but I as fortunate 
 I usually be goin' out with the 9 
 Instead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime ... 
 ... Bag of weed, never cracks, I ain't with that 
 I bought Buddha, some Phillies and a Kit-Kat 
 Now I'm walkin' back, through the drug infested area 
 Which was filled with hysteria 
 When a cop yelled, "Come here, black." 
 I thought to myself, "What part of the game is that?" 
 I didn't do no crime for you to be wastin' your time 
 With your antagonistic mind 
 He said that I was bein' smart and I better run 
 He looked like a Klans-man with a gun 
 So, I started floatin' 
 Police in Queensbridge, they don't be jokin' 
 I ran up my crib, in the nick of time 
 Rolled up a Philly and stashed the 9 
 Police later left, I was outta breath and what not 
 Somebody got shot, that why it's hot 
 I called my man and told him the adventure 
 And later, I meet him at the community center 
 I need a six pack of Beck's 
 It's Just Another Day in the Projects! 
  
 [Hook: Piano Hook][Produced by Dame Grease] 
  
 [Intro: Nas] 
 Where my real niggas at 
 There's a lot of real niggas out there 
 There's a lot of real niggas everywhere 
 That's why you don't fuck with just anybody 
 A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin' 
 Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em 
 And then all hell break loose 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
  
 [Verse 1: Grand Wizard] 
 Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust 
 Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see 
 Boldly go where we once took a nigga before 
 Now the motherfucker beggin' for more 
 It's Thorazine 
 Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper 
 Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes 
 Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop? 
 Nigga standin' there just like a cop 
 Braveheart I'm screamin up the block 
 Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact 
 Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect 
 Plans connect 
 The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck 
 More Jazz than Hornacek 
 I blast, leave your corner wet 
 Straight on top of ya 
 Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia 
 In a schoolyard, we make it hard 
 What's poppin' y'all? 
 We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all? 
 They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
  
 [Verse 2: Horse] 
 I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause 
 Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours 
 Time is runnin' out 
 Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak 
 Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep 
 I miss the shit out of David Dinkins 
 Please free John Gotti 
 They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody 
 Drug wars is real 
 You have no friends in the outfield 
 Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills 
 There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9 
 Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine 
 My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this 
 Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation 
 Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin' 
 You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin' 
 Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin' 
 You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin' 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
  
 [Verse 3: Jungle] 
 Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal 
 Shots in your body make you see-through 
 Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas 
 25 to life bid, never cry niggas 
 Floss when they up north 
 Chest gettin' bigger 
 Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga 
 Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor 
 Come through one man gang like The Predator 
 If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up 
 The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you 
 Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what 
 Ill Will the label 
 Bravehearts, y'all scared of us 
  
 [Verse 4: Nas] 
 Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed 
 When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid 
 These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge 
 Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid 
 Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes 
 Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight 
 Know how much force this is 
 Jungle, Horse, and Wiz 
 Nothin' but horses, kid 
 We go to war for this 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga 
 Quiet niggas will kill 
 Loud niggas talk shit 
 Them be the ones who get killed 
 It's wild where we walk, kid 
 Is you brave nigga 
 Is you a slave nigga 
 Is you a made nigga 
 Or is you a paid nigga[Chorus: Emily] 
 I see people hating other people 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money 
 What's the reason? 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 By the time of age nine I'm already decidin' 
 If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin' 
 Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one 
 By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment 
 And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects 
 Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man 
 I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy 
 Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me 
 So I would go to school and try to get good grades 
 Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids 
 So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum" 
 They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from 
 Got a little older and now I see 
 Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be) 
  
 [Hook: Emily] 
 I see people hating other people 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money 
 What's the reason? 
 For these wars we're fighting with each other 
 Season after season 
 When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin' 
 What's the reason? 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave 
 She never had it, it's not hers to begin with 
 She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners 
 Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on 
 Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid 
 Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin' 
 Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him? 
 I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing 
 Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean? 
 Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom? 
 Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin' 
 But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated 
 A man feels he has to conquer all 
 The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know 
  
 [Hook: Emily] 
 I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace 
 Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason 
  
 I see people hating other people 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin' 
 What's the reason? 
 Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive 
 She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit 
 She called the cops cause she hated his mother 
 Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover 
 How many niggas gon' die this summer? 
 I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder 
 There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer 
 It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife 
 He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night 
 Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz 
 In her pad while she slept 
 They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister 
 Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next 
  
 [Hook: Emily] 
  
 Emily harmonizes as Nas talks: 
 "Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what 
 Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they 
 Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there 
 To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what 
 Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah 
 Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what 
 We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and 
 Shit. Just man... man."[Nas] 
 First I see a flashin' light, then on my own 
 I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone 
 I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole 
 Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul 
 Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell? 
 Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell 
 Is it now that I'm to be judged? 
 Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights? 
 Will embrace me before force takes me 
 Like I'm movin' through high winds 
 See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends 
 Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here 
 Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land 
 Made in my image son of God son of man 
 You came in the spirit for I am that I am 
 Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb 
  
 [Nas] 
 Seen my body layin' down in the ground 
 It was painless, didn't feel a thing 
 Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run 
 I was atheist, committed Suicide 
 I wish I could erase this shit 
 I seen a new life before the Christ 
 He created night & day, the sun & moon 
 From the virgin woman's womb 
 We lookin' down at my body, emergency room 
 Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed 
 It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire 
 Far past the stars far past the Orion 
 I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin' 
 Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin' 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I 
 Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?) 
 Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin 
 When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin 
 When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10 
 It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then 
 Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and) 
 Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin' 
 You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God) 
 Send me on a trip God please the Earth 
 So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin' 
 He gave me life, I screamed out loud that "I Am..." 
 (Nas... Nastradamus) 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am) 
 Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus) 
 And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am) 
 And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am) 
 And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus) 
 And his name was Nastradamus (I Am) 
 (I Am Nastradamus) 
 Nas... 
 Nas... 
 Nas...[Chorus] 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)

 [Verse 1] 
 Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat 
 A good nigga, you don't leave tracks 
 A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that 
 You feel you need that, where the juxs at? 
 These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu 
 Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official 
 Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people 
 They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos 
 Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens 
 All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen 
 She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen 
 Put a root on you, next week they find you missin' 
 Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and 
 Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up 
 Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices 
 Two sides of us, negative and positive 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power) 
 Some of us have angels (the power, the glory) 
 Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)

 Some of us have demons (lust, temptation) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now this is your mom, your good luck charm 
 Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long 
 Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy 
 In and out of jail, mom's screamin', "God take me!" 
 This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him 
 The man of the house, mom and pops separatin' 
 Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked 
 The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now 
 This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies 
 Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be 
 Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values 
 Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you 
 This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of 
 Niggas around you make threats 
 They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament 
 Even though your decision won't help you benefit 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power) 
 Some of us have angels (the power, the glory) 
 Some of us have demons (greed, and lust) 
 Some of us have demons (lust, temptation) 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power) 
 Some of us have angels (the power, the glory) 
 Some of us have demons (greed, and lust) 
 Some of us have demons (lust, temptation) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires 
 Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire 
 Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed 
 Tryin' to eat? You form material needs 
 The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off 
 By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off 
 His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span 
 He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan 
 What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers 
 And any chance he get, he can take niggas 
 He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is 
 When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me 
 You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head 
 And if I let go I'm dead 
 He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit 
 An out of body experience, so now I feel it 
 Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me 
 Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary 
 I never hate, that's just wasted energy 
 The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery? 
 The future - and time only reveals, what fear is 
 False expectations, appearin' real 
 We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told 
 And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power) 
 Some of us have angels (the power, the glory) 
 Some of us have demons (greed, and lust) 
 Some of us have demons (lust, temptation) 
 Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power) 
 Some of us have angels (the power, the glory) 
 Some of us have demons (greed, and lust) 
 Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)[Cee-Lo (Nas)]

 [Verse 1] 
 Mr. International, the man centerfold, women loathe 
 Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls 
 Craftiness, take a stab at it 
 Don't ask if Nasty's back at it 
 I don't run out of magic 
 Popular, box-cutter flow 
 Time is money; the watch cost dough 
 Shakin' the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies 
 The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life 
 The money, hotties on each arm - It's on 
 I party like a rap star, baby, the facts are 
 The third time's a charm 
 So, meet me by the Eiffel Tower 
 Bring a bottle of Dom 
  
 [Cee-Lo] 
 I am here (I am here) 
 This is the place (This is the place) 
 The atmosphere of espionage at expensive taste 
 And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face 
 So, I guess I'll just cut straight to the chase 
 And before I could say the name of who've I came to see 
 Someone suspicion then came to me 
 I'm so close and I've come so far 
 A glass of red wine sent from the woman at the end of the bar 
 I love to talk to you; but I don't have the time 
 She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime 
 Ohh, if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower 
 But darling I have Less Than an Hour 
 (I.... have Less Than an Hour) 
 (I.... have Less Than an Hour) 
 Hmmmm... Ohhhh... funny how time flies when you're having fun 
 (Nas: Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done

 You're on a winnin' streak 
 You've survived the killer streets 
 Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet 
 Number seven might get you to Heaven 
 You break the bank, just might make you a legend 
 It's after eleven, you playin' against a poker face 
 Genie eyes, light green, sippin' on Bellini's 
 You play your cards right, she'll let you touch 
 She'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus 
 Better know who to trust 
 She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs 
 I'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em 
 The crews do somethin' new, inform me 
  
 [Cee-Lo] 
 (I.... have Less Than an Hour) 
 Ohhh... time will wait baby 
 (I.... have Less Than an Hour) 
 Ew-ohhh.... ewwwwwwwww.... hmmmmm.. 
 I'm in the pursuit of my own personal power 
 And I only have an hour[Intro] 
 La la 
 La la, la la, la la la la la la la 
 La la, la la, la la la la la la la 
  
 [Sample 1: Live at the Barbeque] 
 Street's disciple, my raps are trifle 
 I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle 
 Stampede the stage 
  
 [Sample 2: Halftime] 
 Nas, why did you do it 
 You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime 
  
 Check me out y'all 
  
 [Sample 3: It Ain't Hard to Tell] 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Sample 4: The World is Yours] 
 It's yours 
 Whose world is this? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this? 
  
 I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged 
 Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
  
 [Sample 5: One Love] 
 One what? 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
  
 [Sample 6: The Message] 
 Fake thug, no love 
 You get the slug CB4 Gusto 
 Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though 
  
 [Sample 7: Street Dreams] 
 QB since 1933 
 Street dreams are made of these 
  
 Everybody's looking for something 
  
 [Sample 8: If I Ruled the World] 
 Just some thoughts for the mind 
 I take a glimpse into time 
 Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine" 
  
 If I ruled the world (Imagine that) 
  
 [Skit] 
 [Horse]: Yo Jungle, how you feel about that Nas shit? 
 [Jungle]: Niggas heard that shit, man, the fuck is that, man? Sorry man, y-you gotta play that shit to niggas man, niggas know what the fuck time it is man.

What the fuck y'all want, man. Listen to this gangster shit, this is gangster. Real shit! How 'bout that? For the Nas, man. [?] Drugs, man 
 [Horse]: Fuck all y'all faggot motherfuckers[Verse 1] 
 In the Rotten Apple, take a bite, taste the worm 
 Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn 
 Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest 
 I keep my mug blessed,the evil is illegal substance sold 
 Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep 
 MAC-11's in Legends, cracks in the streets 
 Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers 
 Never sober, takin' over, my blood is colder 
 Niggas respect violence so I become it 
 I'm from it, I even done it blunted, so run it 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Yeah, son, you know what this is 
 Take it off, [come on, dunn 
 Don't even come at me like that] 
 [Dunn, come on, dunn] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yeah, imagine this: no guns, no knife 
 It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son 
 Imagine this: no gun, no knife 
 It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah 
 Yeah, imagine that, no gun, no knife 
 It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah 
 Yeah, imagine this: no gun, no knife 
 It's a one on one, son… 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, I'm a cream fiend with a mean dream 
 Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens 
 Give you what you never seen, the infs on the MAC-10 
 It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens 
 Try hard and die hard 
 Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard 
 I walk at piece with a deadly shadow 
 They want to blow me with the double barrel, foul, no sorrow 
 I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in the thinker, dome 
 Make hell your new home, with the blue chrome 
 Mid-State wants me, suave fellow but raunchy 
 The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country 
 But only to shed tears for years 
 Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near 
 Street fightin' was cool, but in school I brought a new tool 
 Duelin' with the devil, a rebel, a fool 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Imagine this: no guns, no knife 
 Just a one on one so now we gots to fight, son 
 Imagine this: no gun, no knife 
 Just a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah 
 Imagine that, no gun, no knife 
 It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah 
 Imagine this: no gun, no knife 
 It's a one on one, son… 
 Yeah, take it to the bridge – Queensbridge 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Yo, whassup money? [Yo yo, do you remember this face?] 
 [Yeah yeah yeah, run these, run these] 
 *sounds of brawl* [Break you down! Get broke!] 
 [No hands, run that, run that, run that, no hands] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep 
 Marked money I keep, play the benches all week 
 I visualize Coups, alligators in suits 
 Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof 
 Sippin' 80 proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up 
 I see some brothers tryin' to roll up, wishin' I could fold up 
 It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie 
 Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me – I'm out 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah yeah, kid, don't front 
 360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin? 
 That's how it comes back at you 
 Queensbridge, that's how we live 
 South side, all that 
 New York, light it up, light it up 
 Yo yo, you saw how I snuffed that kid? 
 Yeah, I saw that, I saw that 
 Ain't no half  steppin' out here 
 That's how we do out here in the street fight![Intro] 
 Crime, life, bitches, money 
 Time.. 
 For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what? 
 One time.. two times.. 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin platinum 
 Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source 
 Nine-one, nine-two, time flew 
 Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule 
 Younger frame, older state of mind 
 Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89 
 When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's 
 Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme 
 God guides us, from public assistance to high rises 
 Condos, houses where y'all can't find us 
 Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up 
 My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up 
 Took advice from a street legend 
 Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent 
 Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes 
 Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate 
  
 [Hook] 
 Look way deep inside yourself 
 Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
 Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
 Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO' 
 Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
 The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
 So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
 Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket 
 Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets 
 Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics 
 We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors 
 I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend 
 Less than ten years ago for me to get dough 
 What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow 
 Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot 
 Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown 
 Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains 
 Canal Street, just lookin at rings 
 Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked 
 How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off 
 For some other big time customer, probably a hustler 
 Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up 
 I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Look way deep inside yourself 
 Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
 Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
 Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO' 
 Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
 The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
 So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
 Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge 
 Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood 
 Keepin bitches, comin through on visits 
 You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished 
 You first time in you known for poppin your toast 
 By your third year in you forgotten by most 
 Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write 
 Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites 
 It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed 
 Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards 
 In they own backyard or in the park 
 One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart 
 In the projects, who gon' die next? 
 Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow 
 Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole 
 Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro 
  
 [Hook] 
 Look way deep inside yourself 
 Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
 Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
 Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO' 
 Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
 The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
 So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
 Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
  
 [Outro] 
 Feel me? 
 One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh 
 What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..[Intro: Nas] 
 Yea, uh, uh, real niggas dawg, ya heard 
 Yea, journey to the life, just journey 
  
 [Verse One: Nas] 
 I'm the nigga that ain't loud 
 Throw C-low, never ace out 
 Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds 
 The observer, money and murder the hood praise it 
 I was raised in it, early age 
 Was presented with the ultimatum 
 Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games 
 Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out 
 Brains numb out, guns out 
 I was smart high hopes in my heart 
 But dope cartels would emerge 
 Bloody shirts on niggas while they hollerin' 
 'Til their lungs don't work 
 Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth 
 With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny "SHOOT" 
 My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth 
 Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit 
 My eyes are the window of my soul 
 My niggas let the Indo roll 
 Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old 
 That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg 
 We been rollin since day one, he down for the cause 
 All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit 
 I'm like - "yo think positive", but he act sick 
 He only think about lettin' his Mac spit 
 He like fuck who he hit 
 Me it bothers, cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless 
 If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets 
 So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em 
 We already lost niggas by how we was movin' 
 We still livin', but our lives need much improvin' 
 I think I'm gonna lose 'em 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 I was blind in this world 
 All I thought about was diamonds and pearls 
 I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl 
 Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib 
 Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live 
 It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror 
 Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind 
 Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be 
 In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me 
  
 [Verse Two: Nas] 
 Feelin' like I got the dons clout 
 Trigger pawn cocked Glocks spray up your moms spot 
 I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols 
 Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles 
 Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved 
 Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars 
 Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers 
 Coroners pick you up from the grass 
 Livin' fast 'til somebody tries meltin' my chest 
 I'm high loosin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec 
 Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax 
 It's like I can't hear my words 'til I'm trapped to the max 
 Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me 
 I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy 
 That don't mean nigga's stupid 
 But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses 
 Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed 
 Planted in this ghetto, where my niggas can't read 
 Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks 
 Now what y'all know about that 
 One side of me wanted out of this life 
 Glue traps on the floor for the mice 
 'Til the nigga saw the light 
 I wanted money when I got it, I would spend it 
 I wanted jewels, but when I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen 
 All of the drama in my life I got my self into 
 All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental 
 I let these niggas words get to me 
 But I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley 
 It's the end of the century 
 I recognized the world is a beautiful place 
 Niggas opinions ruinin' my musical taste 
 Cause everytime I caught a case, could of got me in jail 
 If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail 
 I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt 
 And +My Worst Enemy+ was my self 
 Word to my self...word to my self...word to my self... 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 I was blind to the world 
 All I thought about was diamonds and pearls 
 I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl 
 Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib 
 Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live 
 It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror 
 Cause all this time, it was a fragment in my mind 
 Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be 
 In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Born in NYC beastin', the lord left me no choice 
 Christian pendants, Islamic thoughts, criminal courts 
 Father forgive, I wanna die like Godfather did 
 Standing in lineups I'm paying lawyers, ain't trying to bid 
 Alliances surveillance watching 'em careful when plottin' 
 My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners 
 Ski masks and fake tags in case the car was spotted 
 Lavish hotels, Central Park West, fly apartments - let's rob it 
 Forensics get us sentenced so we the smartest 
 It's livest as Saturday night as I load up a cartridge 
 Let off the fully, got alibis, no need to worry 
 Done right, we don't see the prosecutors or grand jury 
 Reputed mobster style, take the money and run 
 Count it in warehouses, leave town and live 100 years like crocodiles 
 Straight up NYC like a Mets fitted 
 This a tower heist, even Donald Trump can get it 
  
 [Hook x2: Nas] 
 You want respect, money and power, right? 
 Well let's ride tonight; it's a tower heist 
  
 [Verse 2: Rick Ross] 
 I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket 
 Got my J's on, spend a hundred for my watch 
 I feel amaz-on, it's a jungle in these streets 
 Choppers be going "bang", your people need be deceased 
 Everyday is war, living legends you must applaud 
 So light my cigar, or for the foreigners living large 
 Dealin' straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage 
 Your girl on my dick and I may just feel like menage 
 I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask 
 Cause, bitch, it's a heist, give me ice or lose your life 
 My profit's so nice me and dog gon' count it twice 
 It's poppin' tonight, roll the weed, give me a light - UGH! 
  
 [Hook][Intro:] 
 Take it to the bridge 
 To the motherfuckin' bridge 
 Queensbridge in the motherfucker 
  
 [Hook:] x3 
 It Ain't Hard to Tell 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell 
 I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a Tec with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose 
 Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x3 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 What's a beat if the rap don't click 
 I spit rhymes like I'm sick, dying loss in a pit 
 The only way I can escape is by vocals 
 Verbalize a strife 
 Stabbin' ears like a knife hood like 
 The Prophet of the gutter 
 Lyrics are silk mega butter 
 I flow never stutter 
 Clever poetic brothers on a mission 
 Dissin' all who perps the fraud 
 Scrams listen, (and) do what the experts record 
 Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not 
 Well I be packin' like a rasta in a weed spot 
 Hittin' your hearts like a hollow tip 
 Verbally illin' minds manipulated 
 My raps a nickel-plated 
 I illustrate it, X-rated, then move out 
 Nas the parlayer takes you on a new route 
 It's suicide poetry released from a cell 
 With immense clientele, I excel 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x3 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 Now, I'm blessed with the finesse to express like Shakespeare 
 The blocks "Cape Fear" drop metaphors when the breaks clears 
 My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining 
 Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing 
 Cause in my physical, I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x3[Intro 1: Malcolm X sample] 
 The white power structure of today is just as much interested in perpetuating slavery 
 As the white power structure was 100 years ago 
 Only now they use modern methods of doing so 
 And, uh… 
  
 [Intro 2: Paul Mooney sample] 
 White folks made up nigga and don't want me to say it 
 Ain't that a bitch? 
 You made it up, you shouldn't have made it up! 
 You done fucked up, you shouldn't have made up nigga 
 And you made up a song to go with it 
 Please don't make me sing the song 
 Eenie meenie minie 
 You know the god damn song I'm talking about 
 And you change the words when you see black folks 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album 
 My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners 
 Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline 
 I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in 
 I overcame all the opposition 
 My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison 
 Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes 
 But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty 
 This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis 
 I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac 
 Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P 
 I'd take the grave or a bid 
 Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib 
 And plant cracks on the man that's going to church 
 Plants packs on the man that's going to work 
 And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers 
 Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases 
 The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist

 Third grade, singin Star Spangled Banner 
 Using proper manners, learned to handle anger 
 Animal behavior 
 Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on 
 Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song 
 Socks long to my knees 
 Summer breeze runnin through the leaves 
 Playin freeze tag, can I stay out, please dad? 
 Can I hang wit my little gang out? 
 Hearin shots rang out, heard my moms call my name out 
 Come upstairs, run up stairs 
 Take a bath, shit stained underwears 
 Wipe yourself wit paper 
 Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30 
 Wash my plate, ate dinner up late 
 Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball 
 Was my future for this young one 
 Hooping in the sun, proud to be where I come from 
 Later shootin guns fantasizing 
 Fascinated by gold rope chains 
 Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change 
  
 [Hook] *all Nas samples* 2x 
 "Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America" 
 "Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure" 
 "It's like that, you know it's like that" 
 "Nas-Nas'll catch wreck", "You got the mad fat fluid" 
  
 [Nas] 
 Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes 
 Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews 
 Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats 
 Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes 
 They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood 
 They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood 
 They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm 
 Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won 
 E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus 
 Nixon was the anti-christ 
 Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white 
 Listenin to Malcom speak, talcum powder shaving cream 
 Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean 
 Babies is born, big families started to blossom 
 Mad people just applied for apartments and got em 
 Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers 
 From tommy guns to mac 10's 
 QB's new born killers (shit is changed) 
  
 Chorus 2x 
  
 [Nas] 
 Yo everytime I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed 
 Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab 
 Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets 
 Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin 
 Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status 
 Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin 
 I remember park jams 
 Gazelles, perfect wave shell 
 Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze 
 Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare 
 Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air 
 Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch 
 Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz 
 What project is this? 
 QB, Vernon and Tenth 
 12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat 
 What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game 
 When it's all said and done, just remember my name 
  
 Chorus 2x[Intro] 
 Order in court, order in the court 
 No one else but Mr. Jones has the right to be speaking right now 
 Order in the court or I’m gonna start making some arresting here 
 You don’t belong in the court house anyway, your rap concert has been canceled 
 Order in my court, … 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I wake up, wake up in the morning shake my third leg in the toilet 
 Uzi on my night stand, I’m the man you go to war with 
 Not the man you go to war against, 
 Patience I get you if that means I can’t sleep a whole year 
 I get you, I'm official not a tisket, a tasket 
 I put you in the casket with a biscuit 
 The ratchet, the smoke a biscuit, the planted trees advanced weed 
 Doomed forsakers you fucking fake bloods like movie makeup 
 I flow tight as tootie bracers, who he hating us 
 I’ll be on the state bus, shackles is my eight bus 
 Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers 
 I’m the shit for ages, my clip steel wheel … gangsters 
 Click still move like free masons, so we’re from on the flow from the law 
 Cause large is all across the nation, Nas is bread for the plan 
 The hold the grand dragon head in his hand 
 Come and get me, here I am 
 Pok’em, pok’em 
  
 [Hook] 
 I’m not a law prayer, so you could tell your mayor 
 I’m a non-stop driven by poetry slayer 
 One, two, three, down for the count 
 The result my lyrics oh yes, no doubt (X2) 
 Pok’em, pok’em 
  
 [Verse 2: Chuck D] 
 The good man in me gets money and stay on the path 
 But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass 
 My daughter gave me a gift, something to hold 
 A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows 
 I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes 
 Better wait till 
 You’re grown, when in love you will know 
 Everybody’s gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two 
 … against who I don’t know 
 So one who fed you won’t blow, you won’t eat, you won’t cake 
 Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh 
 Getting tale single breasted 
 A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit 
 A women hates a man and stays with him for many years 
 Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him 
 Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he’s still with her 
 She take his cash give it to some other real nigga, like me 
 Pok’em, pok’em, pok’em

 Aiyo, this is big Nas 
 I wanna give a shout-out to my man Premo, you know? 
 From Gang Starr, no doubt 
 Lil' Dap, Jeru, Melachi, the whole crew (Foundation) 
 Queensbridge Crew, forty busters, shorty busters 
 Vernon Posse, Good Fellas, you know how that go 
 My man Ill Will rest in peace forever, God 
 Tragedy, MC Shan and the whole crew, you know how that go 
 Marley Marl, and my man Big Bo locked up in the piece 
 And my man Drawz, you know 
 (Big Mayo chillin', loungin' at the crib, check it out now) 
  
 [Bobbito] 
 The, the mic is open, yo 
 On the Stretch Armstrong showw, hosted by Bobbitooooooo 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 How should I start this? 
 How should I begin, to sin? 
 Grab the microphone and my rhymes'll win 
 Wheel of Fortune, spin, around 
 Check it out, I'm not a rap clown 
 Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound in your dome 
 Hit you with the nick plate chrome 
 Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' home 
 Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head 
 Police... Police want a nigga dead 
 But I'm not goin' out like that, black 
 I kick the actual facts in solar 
 Cold as a Polar Bear, I swear, word to Will 
 But I'mma chill, rhymes'll kill 
 Niggas know the style when I freak the profile 
 Asiatic Child, yo 
 Grand Wizard on the side of me 
 Get on the mic and bless the M-I-C 
  
 [Grand Wizard] 
 Ayio, but I'mma pass it off to my man Six-Nine 
 Kick it one time 
  
 [Verse 2: Six-Nine] 
 Hey, yo, Six-Nine a true to life nigga 
 Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure 
 Niggas don't fuck with the Six-Niner 
 Shorty, watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina 
 Here's the reefer, crack the Sunrise Tequila 
 Kill the Margarita, here's a 50, get some more cheeba 
 The ghetto trooper, so spark up the Bu-Buddha 
 My thoughts'll stay nasty like the underground sewers 
 To be the man, you gotta beat the man 
 It ain't nothin' startin' over here but nothin' mark my Timberlands 
 You want static? Let's have it 
 Niggas who flow like the Atlantic will sink like the Titanic 
 Since birth, I was thinkin' too fast 
 My first beef was with the doctor when he smacked me on my ass 
 The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam 
 My skill's so ill like a white chick with a suntan 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Check it out now 
 One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars 
 Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars 
 I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz? 
 My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses 
 Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real 
 A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja 
 Here's my basis: my razor embraces many faces 
 Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces 
 Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow 
 And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so 
 My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank 
 I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank 
 Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail 
 Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales 
 My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails 
 I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real 
 Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats 
 But, chill! Bless the microphone and say peace 
 So, Sudan, take the microphone in your hand 
 Kick the flim flam 
  
 [Sudan] 
 So, check it out 
 I'm gonna give a strong shout-out, this is to my man Will 
 A little somethin' I done wrote up for my man Will 
 It goes somethin' like this, it's called Rock-a-bye Homeboy 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 4: Sudan] 
 Queensbridge, when will the drama ever cease? 
 I'd like to say peace, Willie, and rest in peace 
 A cool brother who's all about justice 
 I still can't understand how he left us 
 Well... he's gone and life goes on, you know 
 We had a crew, but one by one we go 
 Memories of his face that was full of joy 
 Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye homeboy 
 Reminiscin' with the brothers standin' on the block 
 Never talked a lot, never was a big shot 
 It's so hard to say goodbye, a sad song 
 And damn, I can't believe my man's gone 
 Diggin' back in the days when we used to laugh 
 Now its a memory that's haunted from the past 
 Poor Willy, its a shame how the ghetto got him 
 And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him 
 Three bullets to his back on his own block 
 Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot 
 Queensbridge, wake and up and smell the air 
 And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care 
 Remember Willie and the times we had with joy? 
 Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy 
 Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy 
 Quensbridge style! 
 Rock-a, Rock-a bye 
  
 [Verse 5: Jungle] 
 My skills are ill like the prez with a plan 
 My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan 
 Like a kamikaze, Saddam Hussein then won 
 Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill (Wooo-ooooh) 
 I spill a verse so you can understand 
 I kill rappers off quicker than a motherfuckin' Mic Man 
 And when it comes to a battle, I stand out tall 
 Like the man who played the man on The White Shadow 
  
 One two, one two 
  
 [Nas] 
 What you gonna do when the flavour's comin' after you? 
 Grand Wizard, take my side 
 Grab the microphone and I'mma rock it up like... 
  
 [Verse 6: Nas] 
 To my man Jungle, dwellin' in the jungle 
 Where must we go? Where must we wander? 
 Deep out the skies come the MC Nas 
 Not to surprise, but to civilize 
 All the dumb men wanderin' around the streets 
 Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats 
 I just kick the mad Phillie style 
 Get buckwild 'cause you know my style 
 I could run a word, kick it to a herd 
 Make 'em turn into a rich man, increase the plan 
 The master plan, yo, I'm buggin' out 
 'Cause the weed got me buggin', plus the Guinness Stout 
 Grand Wizard, yo, you my physical 
 Why don't you mic the make, make the microphone miserable? 
  
 [Verse 7: Grand Wizard] 
 It's the G, the G, the G, the G, the Wiz 
 You know that our culture's gone get theirs 
 I got my man Nasty on the side of me 
 My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hidin', G 
 I am the man that'll break it down 
 I'll break it all down 'cause I got the sound 
 I got Queensbridge backin' me 
 The Tec and everythin', I'm comin' strapped, G 
 It's like that, check it out, uh huh 
  
 [Verse 8: Nas] 
 Yo, check it out, y'all 
 Money and murder, money and murder 
 The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin', my swerve 
 The words are poetic 
 I sound energetic when I'm blunted or Moët'd 
 My microphone's upsetted 'cause I'm crazy 
 Now you know, never lazy 
 Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can 
 Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman 
 Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'... 
 Nah, can't be flippin' like that 
 'Cause you niggas try to jock the style 
 But I left that shit to get the new shit to flow like the Nile 
 Now you can't catch up, G 
 'Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C 
 I keep gettin' newer, can't step to a 
 Nigga from the Bridge, so, you keep that shit 
 And I'mma flip the script next year 
 And my real name is Nasir 
 Can't spell it 'cause I say it too clear 
 The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use 
 When it comes to mics, I bruise 
 I just go with the magical mystic flow 
 Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo 
 I get Illmatic with the style that's insane 
 Comin' out a fuckin' murderer's brain 
 Grand Wizard, please take this mic from me 
 Before I bug the fuck out and wind up D-A-E-D 
 Wait, D-E-A-D, I'm buggin', fuck that shit 
  
 [Various shout-outs][Produced by Bud'da] 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 (I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain 
 (I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you 
 (I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game 
 (I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My daily dose is ferocious 
 I smoke dope, just as strong as opium 
 Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration; 
 Speakin on podiums 
 Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals 
 Young black, poor education guns crack 
 The gang violence done that 
 Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches 
 Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open 
 Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires 
 Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in 
 Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac 
 To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret 
 Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness 
 Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten 
 I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin 
 What happens when money don't make you happy 
 I wish this on no person 
 Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements 
 I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit 
 Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on 
 Pull up the block my brother's on 
 I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police 
 Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here) 
 We left the drug game alone 
 Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home 
 What could you tell us? 
 At funerals my eyes swell up (damn) 
 Look at my dog lay in the casket 
 Twin shotgun barrels had blasted 
 And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper 
 As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin 
 It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die? 
 It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by 
 Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room 
 I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons 
 And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead 
 Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but.. 
  
 [Hook][Nas] 
 Uh, word 
 You dont get this everyday word 
  
 With so much drama, in QBC it's kinda hard bein Escobaro 
 Eldorado red sippin Don out the bottle 
 My lifes like a Donald Goines novel, 
 We wave glasses like bravo Drunk niggas with mad problems 
 Shot pockets niggas on the block rock this 
 Buy cocaine cook it and chop it, lookin to profit 
 In triple ways goin through this difficult stage called life 
 With each year my physicals praised, 
 Niggas slip beyond the reach of help 
 Caught in the street, thinkin they can teach they self 
 When all we wanted was a piece of wealth 
 And randomly feed our family these streets are insanity 
 Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy 
 Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be 
 Heavy desire hold this 9' ready to fire, you know me show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire, it's on.. 
  
 [Nature] 
 Its time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way, predicted Platinum in less then a day 
 So for that we toast, this ones for us why you acting Hov, all I do is write rap, stack, relax and smoke 
 Watchin my dreams come true, stay humble in the eyes of others, politicing with the wisest brothers 
 Its Nature, one a the latest, peak how I play this, straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites 
 From now till the day that I'm stiff, foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift 
 Stuck in my ways type chauvinistic, since a youth I had a thing for big hoops, flooded rings and older bitches 
 Holdin my riches in lump-somes for trust funds, fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns 
 While some'll get drunk beat wives and cuss sons, a slow process called life lets show progress.. 
  
 [Dre] 
 When I said I hold my own I wasn't frontin never claimed to be the baddest for skills, I got a little something 
 Coming through never the same old, hit a slick verse sippin drinks under a tropic rainbow 
 Nothin could give me more pleasure to spark this I worked the hardest, ducked the farthest makin me illest producing artist 
 Done crimes I ran from one time, could catch me with my crew bustin rhymes in the Sunshine 
 State, no case to fear I been with millionaires, out to make a killin for real's my resolution this year 
 Few places I walked most imagine, new faces I met at beauty pageants, past cuties now wanna do me 
 But never forgot where I was from, I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one 
 If you ain't speakin money language I can't hang with peak, your conversation is weak, I need the heat to get us famous, so it's senseless speak[Chorus: Amerie] 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh) 
 The rest of my life 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Life: dead presidents, devilish men 
 Overthrow king from they thrones cause of their negligence 
 Death, real shit'll start comin' to light 
 Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, what? 
 Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin' 
 Pork bacon, double-cross Satan 
 Heathens, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons 
 But glory go to God, y'all beneath him 
 If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat 
 He'll show you streets where them big dealers drove at 
 Where low-key killers let the fo' clap 
 Blocka-blocka-blocka—oh 
 The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows 
 Everything a hood brother think he needs—yo 
 You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap 
 And I'mma use that for the— 
  
 [Chorus: Amerie] 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Burnt-out, kicked to the curb 
 So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' real fast 
 In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the past 
 Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash 
 Lawyer want cash, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gel 
 They burnt a range with a Molotov cokctail 
 My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover 
 Them cops swear, my little nigga told on me 
 I'm thinkin, "Hello, where's the L-O-V-E" 
 Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names 
 Word to his pops with elephant veins 
 They both locked-up still, word to Will 
 I'll make it and chill for the— 
  
 [Chorus: Amerie] 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 My man gave his mommy coke 
 So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke 
 Damn, nigga, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms 
 So she don't have to bone for dimes? 
 Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects 
 Where dogs shit and piss 
 Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed 
 Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics 
 Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars 
 To ten LPs 
 What can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all? 
 I'm Nas—on a track that's unorthodox 
 Like my life could've been offed by the cops 
 Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale 
 About the rest— 
  
 [Chorus: Amerie] 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life 
 Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The rest of my life[Verse 1: Nas] 
 It's the late night greasy spoon patron, poolhall making 
 Big bets, midsection got the 8 in 
 Dior Christian pimping, got that penal system diction 
 Riffing, you don't want it you snitching 
 Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR 
 Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat 
 Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black, bitches want my chipped tooth back 
 Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked 
 Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi 
 Still playing numbers you can't stop me 
 Still wearing bundles and spark weed 
 If I ever say 'Queens get 'em', you know they got me 
 Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef 
 So lead by example or get trampled 
 Since Hip Hop is Dead, this is the N 
 Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Don't hate me now, congratulate me now 
 I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe 
 Don't hate me now, congratulate me now 
 I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes 
 Still getting it and don't even love the doe 
 Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo' 
 Stay splifted cause you know that I love the dro 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The style is taboo, the chain's offensive 
 Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage 
 The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes 
 Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants 
 The Apprentice but not Trump, I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps 
 That you don't see much, sucker free from chumps 
 Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em 
 He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son 
 Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns 
 Don't make me grab your only son, I'm coming from 
 A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape 
 From phonies who hate when you rolling with papes 
 That's why the god party with juicy models 
 They mob me, the gnarly, Charlie Luciano - hardly 
 Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all for spitting songs that involve me nigga 
 Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yo this is Nas, Queens own 
 Hip Hop Is Dead so put this shit in your vein 
 Queens Own 
 Queens Own[Rich Nice] 
 What's happening brothers and sisters? 
 Welcome to our time 
  
 [Jessica Care Moore] 
 Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles 
 Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write 
 Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight 
 Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right 
 Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsing 
 Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blasting 
 As the Earth rebels my womb swells 
 The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit 
 You can't find if you ain't never had it 
 Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted 
 Power-shifting comb-fisting I predict Goddesses you running after witches 
 I kiss my fourteen stitches 
 Keep all my baby girl wishes 
 I predict all the oceans turn dry 
 Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert 
 We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers 
 Wash your face between our legs 
 While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja 
 Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills 
 Ban all pink and yellow pills 
 I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch 
 Hate groups will be bombed 
 Childbirth becomes outlawed 
 Always will be branded numbered and logged 
 All paper money is gone 
 Confused scholars can't interpret our scrolls 
 Your sky has holes 
 We know the young is old 
 Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told[Verse 1] 
 Yo, my man was regulatin' on niggas he used to thug with 
 Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars 
 BM, Jaguars, they cash was large 
 Since he was wild, they let him in 
 He did a crazy number of things 
 To put himself deeper under they wing 
 It didn't take long for duke to get on 
 Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong 
 Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin' 
 Drivin' they cars, robbin connects 
 Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin' 
 Young don, now they know they weakness 
 They never seen it comin' 
 Son was on some real take over the streets shit 
 Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now 
 Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin shit is different 
 'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it 
 I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years 
 6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear 
 Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like 
 Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her 
 'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen 
 On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava 
 Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil 
 Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only 
 Fuckin' with kings, niggas official 
 If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you 
 We converse on the state of hip hop 
 We share the same views and feelings 
 He sling 'caine, crib costin' 2 million 
 He plan to leave the streets forever 
 But niggas that wanted him left him 
 Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him[Intro] 
 Yo it's your boy Rodney Darkchild 
 Cracking it up.. 
 With my favorite DJ, DJ Stolen 
 You already know.. 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Heard you got your master's, did college up 
 Never looked back, now that's what's happening 
 And it's good to see you made it out the hood 
 With a degree, a true man with passion 
 Now you could enter the so-called 
 "White Man's Society" and go right past them 
 Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face 
 But it's always absent 
 You know that's him eating foie and ambrosia 
 Watch on his arm, golden, Latin 
 Try to get his attention 
 But he's flinching, guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention 
 We were neighbors some time ago 
 He was kinda cold, in this restaurant 
 Full of his kind and more 
 He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know 
 His side of the city where he resides, so 
 I had to go 
 I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes 
 Hate so-called "intellectuals" 
 No balls, he suggests we vote 
 He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks 
 He want to lecture folks 
 Cause he professional and he suggest that we don't sell dope 
 Suggest that we don't sell dope 
 And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Who are you, tryna tell me who I am? 
 Tryna tell me who I am? 
 Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not? 
 Tryna tell me what I'm not 
 Who are you, tryna tell me who I am? 
 Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm Idi Amin, Marcus Garvey, H. Rap Brown 
 I'm Muhammad Ali, I'm Reginald Lewis 
 George Washington Carver, I'm Nas with incredible music 
 Let's do it, thinking of a master plan 
 Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster 
 Watching niggas argue, killing like a boss do 
 With my hell up in Harlem, hat in hand 
 With a girl named Pat, she more than a waitress 
 To order a drink with. She divorced a banker, and bought the bar 
 She got an automobile, she gives an order to kill 
 You get caught and robbed 
 We could see your walk is off, you could lose your rhythm 
 When you walk in the gutter for a while 
 You easily go to soft from hard 
 Now we all about hustlers, number runners 
 Hoes and sharks and we all know the code of the block 
 And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit 
 Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks 
 Brother don't start, go build your Noah's Ark 
 You could float to the end of the world 
 And pretend what you not, but I know what you are 
 While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot 
 While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot 
 Matter of fact, you're an easier target 
 And I respect everything you accomplished 
 But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense 
 So who the fuck are you? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 She Queen of Nzinga 
 Winnie Mandela, Ida B. Wells 
 So why can't you tell? Why can't you tell?[Intro] 
 I'd like to dedicate this one here, to my star 
 Someone I cherish, she loves me unconditionally 
 No matter what, our love will always be here for you baby 
 Yeah 
 So from God, he gave me this gift, you (ha ha) 
 And I give you this, the world (If I had it all) 
  
 [Hook] 
 (If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world 
 Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all) 
 Yeah, just me and my little one 
 Just me and my little one (If I had it all) 
 I'd give you the world 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Even though we don't live in the same home 
 And I mightta miss your graduation 
 And no matter how many miles I'm away from you 
 You know that I love you 
 Hear daddy on every station 
 Thinking, I'm loving my occupation 
 I know I got you home waitin', Desy 
 I do it all for you (if I had it all) 
  
 [Hook] 
 (If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world 
 Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all) 
 Yeah, just me and my little one 
 Just me and my little one (If I had it all) 
 I'd give you the world 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Even though you'll be grown soon 
 You gotta stand on your two 
 Please listen what daddy told you 
 I know you think that I'm old school 
 You'll see that I was right soon 
 One day, you will meet the right groom 
 And then, you will see your life bloom 
 And then you'll know what's right for you (If I had it all) 
  
 [Hook] 
 (If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world 
 Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all) 
 Yeah, just me and my little one 
 Just me and my little one (If I had it all) 
 I'd give you the world 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Respect your mom, no one will replace her 
 She's the one who went through the labour (If I had it all) 
 But you don't owe her no favours 
 But her respect is due 
 See, daddy just wanna show you (If I had it all) 
 All the heartache I go through (If I had it all) 
 It's for you 
  
 [Outro] 
 If this world were mine, I'd give it all to you (If I had it all) 
 Yeah, (If I had it all) 
 It's your world baby girl 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, just me and my little one (If I had it all) 
 Just me and my little one (If I had it all) 
  
 (If I had it all) 
 (If I had it all)[Intro (Sampled)] 
 Angel Dust 
 Yeah, Angel Dust 
 Yeah 
 Yeah, Angel Dust 
  
 [Verse] 
 Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings 
 The devil's dust, PCP invading bloodstreams 
 People lining up to get it, fantastic, knew how to flip it 
 Illegal substance constructed and plus addictive 
 Trusted and respected, almost got me arrested 
 All the time I invested in school is now of question 
 Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own vomit 
 A fool for chaos, taking what we could salvage 
 Hustling is a art, I'm just tryna be smart 
 Strung out bodies found in the park, Shaolin was my heart 
 We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back 
 My raps were like crystallized powder before crack 
 Raw, uncut, like what is sold in front of the storefront 
 The sidewalk was my brother's office 
 We cut our losses, I had choices 
 I took a pen, became the voice for the voiceless 
 My people walking in a zombie state 
 Life is short, even mine's at stake 
  
 [Interlude] 
 "The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others." 
  
 "The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source."[NAS] 
 Yea (House of Hits) 
 Finally up in this nigga 
 On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal 
 On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal 
 To my seed, May I lead you into no breed of evil 
 In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
 You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's 
 Monkey see, Monkey do 
 A shorty sipping sunny dew 
 Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. thats mad smokey 
 Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
 Up in the Marriot, Suite 3010 
 Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell the hoes to hurry in 
 We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
 And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
 Rolling on you non descript niggas 
 Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
 Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
 In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust 
  
 Chorus 
 On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
 On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 
  
 [K-L from ScrewBall] 
 Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
 This is your sorry excuse 
 Get your neck put in a noose 
 K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
 Over the snare drum 
 We reproduce like cum 
 Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
 Giving life to idea 
 Through the verse is what he does 
  
 [Kamakazee a.k.a. KL] 
 See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
 We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
 QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
 We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
 We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
 Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
 Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
 From the ruckus 
 Your gone and your crew still love us 
 Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
 I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
 Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
 Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
 Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
 Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town 
  
 Chorus 2x 
  
 [Cormega] 
 (Play some treats on us) 
 Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
 The side bubble converti 
 Eyes low cause the lye blow 
 Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
 Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
 The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
 When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
 Exhale precise shine like cocaine white 
 Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
 With diamond rolexes, that drive infinit's and lexus 
 So send my enemies a message 
 My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
 I'm still protected 
 So never ask why I write so violent 
 My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
 I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
 When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
 To the kid who made my man Ill Will's blood spill 
 (On the real) 
 When I catch up to your ass you know the deal 
  
 [Nas and Cormega] 
 On the real 
  
 Chorus 4xAyo I hit the Earth like a comet, Invasion 
 Nas is like the afrocentric asian 
 Right here with the amazing Green Lantern 
 Serious radio, y’all know what it is 
  
 NaS too real, NaS true king 
 You know the king 
  
 Cars with police radars on highways boppin 
 Bullpin therapy cell block dodging 
 Pissy stairways missed them days not when 
 They shut down the stores when I’m shopping 
 Used to be pop locking, train hopping 
 Face covered in stocking 
 Six pack Bud drinking gambler 
 Fuck them cameras in front of the man 
 Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck 
 More hits than gambling huff 
 I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes 
 I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota 
 Nigga honestly I call this a culture 
 My sister’s a snake, my brother’s a vulture 
 My mother’s the block, my father’s a ghetto piranha 
 Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama 
 Obama, if the kids mirror you 
 We’ll all push Masaratis with the silver hue 
 They fear that connection 
 I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection 
 Gotti was a racist but he still get praises 
 We don’t give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta 
 Bricks come with Bill Clinton’s name on it taped up 
 Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them 
 Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim 
 Know some hood girls who did time that could take them 
 Rappers changing families, fags are all lost 
 I’m at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve 
 Save the small talk, I feel alive 
 New Porches Jordan number fives 
 Already said I’m the last real nigga alive 
  
 Nas, let my words guide you 
 From crips to piru this is survival 
 Turn my voice up 
 Let my words guide you 
 From crips to piru this is survival 
 Invasion![Hook] 
 Honies, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk 
 Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy 
 Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities 
 Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly 
 High up in a five, realizin' the price paid 
 For this life laid in the light shade 
 One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl 
 Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it 
 Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless 
 Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives 
 While you could catch me in a crisp white five 
 Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on 
 My theme song, Love and Happiness, how can it seem wrong? 
 I mean, before this, I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts 
 Now, I grown up, got it chromed up 
 Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff 
 Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love 
 I feel a slow buzz off the dutch 
 This is everyday, every second, got to make it pay 
 Every lesson I learnt got me open 
 While most of these rappers'll stay burnt 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro 
 El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle 
 My life is like a Donald Goines novel, we wave glasses like bravo 
 Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets 
 My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it 
 Lookin' to profit in different ways, goin' through this difficult stage 
 Called life, but each year my physical's praised 
 Some fell beyond the reach of help 
 Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself 
 When all we wanted was a piece of wealth 
 And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity 
 Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy 
 Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be 
 Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life 
 Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain 
 Ice, the chain and all the followers came 
 They tried to throw me off track but I caught that 
 They thought I lost that but I'm continuin' to make more stacks 
 Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin' 
 Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches 
 Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared 
 On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds 
 The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks 
 It's real, you violate, be in a pine box 
 If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy 
 I didn't make the game, the game made me 
 Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions 
 Haters keep hatin' and ladies'll keep glancin' 
  
 Y'all know the routine out this muthafucka, word up[Nas] 
 Alka Seltzer... in this motherfucker... I gotta take shit 
 Ay there go my book... I been looking for this book 
  
 What, What... Yea 
  
 [Nas] 
 I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79' 
 Everybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons 
 Shorties on the block, push drops and carry on 
 Niggas look through our window, where ever we drove 
 Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes 
 We the Queens Kings 
 I used to view the cats that I owe... see things... 
 That made me real, but my skin and my soul 
 Girls who turned hoes 
 Friends who turned foes 
 Bad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go 
 Never sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!... 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Everything Is Real... And... Where We Heading Now... Up to more Money... It be More Fun... Leave with Mo' Bitches... and Carry More Guns 
  
 Where We Heading Now... Where We Going Yo... Getting Real Son... We Gon let It Flow... Leave with Mo' Bitches... And Be More Dough... It Be More Fun... Holding More... 
  
 [Nas] 
 How the hell, are we supposed to excel from the street... 
 Where the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat 
 Quantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos 
 Cell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil 
 Bust a lil metal lead (led) 
 Wrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound 
 That's if the God's down 
 It's a struggle, brothers jump bail 
 To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale 
 On the hard with the god Shapelle... a Queens Conrad 
 Yo run and come with the dime bag 
  
 [Shapelle] 
 Yo, Yo-Yo 
 Ayo I need dat 
 I got to smoke dat... 
 Sell me some Chunky Black 
  
 [Nas] 
 So I could smoke away the pain 
 Try to find my brain 
 But the thought still remain 
 Yo it's on again 
 Once the jail take these chains 
 Cause I been through it 
 The drug game I thought I knew it 
 I got knocked, went to trial 
 But I blew it 
 25... but only lived 20 years of my life 
 Took 5 from me 
 Got me wrapped up like a Mummy 
 Now I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home 
 Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone 
 Now I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers... 
 Bitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers 
 Imagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict 
 Who love fucking with faggots 
 But I sip alot of Savage 
 I sat him down, and made him study mathematics 
 Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking... 
 About this reefer I'm a get this weekend 
 On the V.I. (visit) 
 I rather be... uh, dam, dam 
  
 [Fades Out]Ruk: 
 Ill Will...yeah yeah yo...Queensbridge niggas...crud love baby.. 
  
 Verse 1: (Ruk) 
 Aiyo, I zone out 
 Feelin' like I'm in Capone's house 
 Starin' at Manhattan and The Bridge with the chrome out 
 Ki's on the table, black tanktop, long cable 
 Thoughts of overtakin' the table 
 Dismantle and disable 
 Verbal, made fatal, what drug paper do 
 Straight duct tapin', apin' a few 
 Takin' Mo' and Henny straight and things loose 
 Puffin' the fruits, thug in a duece 
 Flaggin', pants saggin', fuckin' ya goose 
 I'm like nothin' to you 
 Dumpin' the Rug' and your group in a red coog' 
 Jump in the Isuzu and cruise 
 Blank tints, bulletproof, red Timb boots 
 Nigga loose, license plate screamin' "Fuck you" 
 Drunken days, I wish ya'll knew 
 Thug dreams, what it means to you 
 Red seams, triple beams 
 40 inch blings, Ill Will the fuckin' team 
 This for my niggas in the Bridge from Queens

 Verse 2: (Nas) 
 Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes 
 Pinky rings, big rounders with tools, bossin' wild crews 
 Slacks, overlaps, applejack hats quarterfield coats 
 Cadillacs with white walls and chrome wheel spokes 
 They were organized, investin', had a piece of the hood 
 They had drugs, bettin' numbers, police understood 
 They played the Cotton club, red carpet, hoes on they arm 
 Plush mink, pimped out gangsta, civil rights wasn't won 
 Every Christmas they were Santa Claus, Nixon was the Anti-Christ 
 Bitches asses were bigger then, sniffin' nose candy white 
 Listenin' to Malcolm speak, talcum powder, shaving cream 
 Layin' back, barber chair, straight razor clean 
 Babies were born, big families started to blossom 
 Mad people just applied for apartments and got 'em 
 Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers 
 From Tommy guns to MAC Tens it's Q.B.'s newborn killers 
  
 Verse 3: (Ruc) 
 96 buildings of children, guns, and bad feelings 
 Q.B. see we rep by the Millions 
 Each block, ten spots, a hundred different villians 
 In abundance my dunnettes run this drug dealin' 
 Stash the jums in hallway ceilings 
 Gangsta paradise, watch the ice, nigga make a killin' 
 In the cut on the steps yo gettin' good neck 
 Only in the projects, we die with respect 
 Pussy niggas quiet as kept will riot the set 
 Six blocks of real niggas vexed 
 Assorted irons and vests, stress on they chest 
 20 half a G's on Henny, Son, the whole hood is wet 
 In memory of...who's next? 
 Train they set, lend they Teck, earn your check 
 Nigga, you better rep 
 Real niggas come out the projects 
 40 to the 41st, Vernon to the 12th

 QBC's finest, Bing, Crime Fam, Killa Kids, Malik The Hitler 
 Hot Bars, Mo King, shouts to Pop, Wild Gremlins, Germ and Norm 
 Let's get it on.....[Verse 1 - Nas] 
 If Macy's don't have it 
 A hatred addict 
 I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around 
 Or I'm wasting fabric 
 I don't feel great until my plushest pieces 
 Cause you to suck your teeth 
 Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing 
 Women dream I'm your husband 
 I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian 
 Ice disgusting. I started bling 
 How could you question my direction? 
 I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of 
 The foreign movie posters, the frames 
 Starring French names, look closer 
 ? to the worm food 
 I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool 
 And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled 
 Hard-bottomed shoes, chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia 
 My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier 
 Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope 
 Til my body cut up like a bag of dope 
 And hope I die ? 
  
 [Hook - Nas] 
 Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights 
 If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right 
 Nah! No not never, no not ever 
 I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are 
  
 [Verse 2 - Nas] 
 Diggi-diggi-dignitaries, Carhart congress 
 Fitted hat high rank officials 
 World Bank like Rothschilds 
 Take the wool from over your eyes 
 Who conspired to deceive you and I 
 It's easier for a man to believe a big lie 
 Than a small truth. Money's not evil 
 It's the love of money that's the root 
 Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase 
 Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise 
 Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye 
 To see if I'm high. I got my piece of the pie 
 My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly 
 Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk 
 You wouldn't understand our thoughts 
 How many black leaders are bought 
 Why the fuck you care if I rap about 
 How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss 
  
 [Hook - Nas] 
 Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights 
 If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right 
 Nah! No not never, no not ever 
 I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are[Verse 1] 
 Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison 
 Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM' 
 I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor 
 I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you 
 Street connects, Mob ties on East and West 
 We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much 
 Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff 
 Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5 
 Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts 
 Conscience who tolerate no nonsense 
 Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert 
 Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth 
 I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe 
 The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggas work with the feds 
 Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead 
 I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned 
 From the corner's with the winos laughin' 
 Dealers and five-o blastin' 
 Capitalist thoughts like Presidents 
 I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to fuck wit 
  
 [Hook: Uncredited Female (Nas)] 
 You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma) 
 ..Don't think so (Don't think so) 
 It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?) 
 What do you know about me? 
 (See what you don't know me you'll never will) 
 (And what you don't know will get yourself killed) 
 About me 
 (See what you don't know me you'll never will) 
 (And what you don't know will get yourself killed) 
 You'll never know 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin 
 Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons 
 Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches 
 Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches 
 Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's 
 I fuck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's 
 I fuck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me 
 My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat 
 Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master 
 Half Apache, half African, mutts is what I call us Black men 
 Lead astray, on drugs and cups of alcohol, cause back when 
 They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in 
 But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town 
 It's all haunted, all on top slave burial grounds 
 Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage 
 Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways 
 Money and murder: interprets the American dream 
 The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing 
 Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous 
 Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this 
  
 [Hook: Uncredited Female (Nas)] 
 You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma) 
 ..Don't think so (Don't think so) 
 It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?) 
 What do you know about me? 
 (See what you don't know me you'll never will) 
 (And what you don't know will get yourself killed) 
 About me 
 (See what you don't know me you'll never will) 
 (And what you don't know will get yourself killed) 
 You'll never know 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores 
 The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor 
 Without God to worship, see we would be more lost 
 Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws 
 A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions 
 My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers 
 Niggas is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive 
 My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers 
 Niggas I fuck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's 
 Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees 
 Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free 
 But bitches saw my video and think they know me 
 These niggas bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me 
 Stay out my path homey, you fuckin' wit a true G 
 Bitch +You Don't Know Me+

 And Femme Fatale 
  
 [Nas] 
  
 Black pirellis rolling over this makaveli 
 Two platy LPs 
 Still the feds tap my celli 
 Made a mil and another mil 
 Just signed another deal 
 From the bridge ever summer deal 
 Niggas run to steal 
 Cracks and bundles 
 Wanna be down ask Jungle 
 React humble but we blast guns too 
 Now to son you is a deeper plan 
 So when I jam 
 Reach the pan 
 Check the sale let the sound scan 
 Keep a brown tan 
 From vacationing 
 Chicks in Vegas 
 Tryna guess us how much we made to spin 
 Two Tiphannys from the Colosseum 
 Green olive BMs 
 Tracks from TM lack when we see em 
 Grip the heat 
 When the sixth season 
 Jump out the S4s 
 And test yours 
 Tudor watches 
 Allah watches 
 Stubborn, you won't admit that Escobar got this 
 On top let me explain what the cock is 
 Firm Biz came livin' 
 Naturally fly, diamond rings glistenin' 
 Make it seem sickenin' 
 What's really ill is how the team's clickin' 
 Femme Fatale on some dope shit 
 Flow sick we stay incorporate 
 Firm giving you a dosage 
 Of high explosives 
 You kidnap we kidnap 
 You blast shit, I did that 
 Cuttin' through the chase we bring it to where you live at 
 I wouldn't play you 
 I'd rather try you by your label 
  
 [Mary J.Blige] 
  
 Miss maximillion 
 Exotic diamonds let it charm 
 Legal life of bear arms 
 Protecting my squad from harm 
 Murder, Danger 
 Backstabbers and snakes 
 Murderers and Jakes 
 Spend thugs but the drugs a case 
 Fuck y'all feel 
 And them accusations you make me 
 Wow femme fatale we increasing the stakes 
 Platinum plates choosin' isles 
 Like my cheese willie style 
 850 on the dig and if you see me

 Major league mamis

 Got your clique quick to buy these 
 Who wanna try these? 
 Firm colleagues 
 Somali's, think they're badass 
 16 bars on that ass 
 Y'all niggas shat ass 
 Ali aye quatro 
 Play the passenger of chaco 
 6 to got though 
 Think you hot but you not though 
 Play the corner 
 Be the type of bitch to run up on ya 
 Much longer 
 While y'all get short bread like launa 
 You're a goner 
 Rhyme shoota, top shootas 
 With the lugas true das 
 Stats rulas 
 Firm biz grab the cougas 
  
 [Noreaga] 
  
 It be the firm biz getting it off 
 Slow regez the elegant black prince 
 We take the top gator 
 Black and shrotopass like im a raider 
 Sophistacater 
 Hang tight like dre right 
 Flow like hawian in the broad day light 
 I give all that I have 
 All in my power to see the day 
 That the crowd weighted 
 You expired and outdated 
 Re segregated 
 None of my people graduated 
 Ain't no progress in the projects 
 It's the same process 
 Rise to the top of New York 
 Keep the digest 
 Through all my cornets 
 Global solar 
 It's young omar 
 The shuffuler 
 We analyze who they really are 
 Familiar, blow holes into your interior 
 You minute, little man 
 You think you general? 
  
 [Nature] 
  
 I put the hinds betters 
 Fake thugs styles glued together 
 Saying old rhymes show signs 
 You're through whatever 
 Eat your heart out 
 I play my part now 
 Fiend to be part of the squad 
 But I'm not gonna be shot down 
 Who's how now? I'm disgusted at you 
 Rap doo doo 
 It's funny if you let these cats fool you 
 The whole no wait 
 Your values dying at a slow rate 
 Opposition track live niggas pop gats 
 Been doin' this since the days of hot tracks 
 Claimin' you in the firm how's that? 
 When you got your spot jacked 
 Read between the lines 
 The foulest dreams was lead to blind 
 Tonight is excellence redefined 
 In the form of Nature, Noreaga 
 Nas, Mary J. Blige 
 Femme Fetale on the rise 
 Manager extraordinaire 
 My man, Jungle 
 Pussy rebundled like desert plans 
 Spitting vivid raps 
 My whole clique rocking fitted hats 
 Millionaire status play the block give it back 
 Thanks to who? 
 My pen names tight like langston hughes 
 Generating chips, picking which banks to choose 
 Clever robberies, on deposits 
 I got this, why niggas on the blocks 
 Stare at bitches gossip 
 I pop shit so understand me 
 From day one I rap whole new guns 
 That run in the family

 Wa dada dang wa da da dang Hey Listen to my mac milli just go bang 
 Wa dada dang wa da da dang this is the firm biz[Intro: Nas + Alicia Keys] 
 Nasty ("Yeah, yeah") 
 (New York, New York, New York, New York) 
 Ayo, Black, it's time—again! ("Yeah, yeah") 
 (New York, New York, New York, New York) 
 Yeah—Premier! ("Yeah, yeah") 
 (New York, New York, New York, New York) 
 ("Ayo, Black, it's time") 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 If you knew my streets— 
 —you would know, all everybody talk about is who got beef 
 Who's snitchin', who told police 
 Who came home, who's still gone, who rest in peace 
 Now they killin' over music-money, not drugs—rap replaced it 
 'Cause thugs with no brains got no patience 
 New jacks—I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin' 
 Musician, inflictin' composition of pain 
 I'm like Saddam Hussein 
 —still alive, lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains 
 I birthed the game, learned you lames a new lesson 
 Your crew's soft, man, y'all need some new weapons 
 The Ps breed warriors in skullies and Timbies 
 Around micks, spics, niggas, and guineas 
 From my ghetto kings in deep thought, we don't blink 
 But don't think we wastin' our time 
 It's a New York state of mind 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys] 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoah ohh 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty 
  
 [Verse 2: Alicia Keys] 
 It's like a jungle out here 
 So much struggle out here 
 And my dreams steal my rest 
 Sleep's the cousin of death 
 Always feels like a race against father time 
 In the Streets of New York 
 (New York state of mind, New York state of mind) 
 All I see is street hoes 
 And bullet holes in our people 
 Only crime fills the brain 
 Feels like I'm goin' insane 
 The revolution has to start, don't waste no time 
 In the Street of New York 
 (New York state of mind) 
 New York state of mind 
 (New York state of mind) 
 C'mon 
  
 [Altered Chorus: Alicia Keys] 
 New York, New York, New York, New York ohh 
 State of mind (New York City) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York ohh 
 State of crime (New York City) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York ohh 
 Big dreams (New York City) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York ohh 
 Big schemes 
  
 [Bridge: Alicia Keys] 
 Oh, it's like the game 
 Just ain't the same 
 Baby thugs and girls 
 With no shame 
 Can't get away (get away) 
 Epidemic plague (plague) 
 Every hood in every state 
 Don't have no reasons cause believing's hard to find 
 In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) 
 In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) 
 In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) 
 In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) 
  
 [Verse 3: Rakim] 
 I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin' 
 A lot of footsteps to follow, I been steppin' 
 Mind stressin'—tryna find direction, crime spreadin' 
 Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11 
 I live fast, hustle like today is my last 
 I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave 
 Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin' off 
 Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war 
 The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics 
 Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis 
 The opposite of Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra 
 Alicia Keys, Nas and, Ra; the gangsta's opera 
 So, New York City—walk with me, talk gritty 
 It's up to us, New York, it's our city 
 Here the man come with the anthem—hands up 
 It's time, the thrill is back New York, so stand up 
  
 [Chorus + Outro/Coda: Alicia Keys + Rakim] 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh 
 (Uh. Yeah.) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty 
 (Crucial Keys. Ya God, Rakim Allah) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh 
 (New York City. Nasty Nas) 
 New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty 
 (A. Keys. Yeah, c'mon)

 Where we met, I had to give her her respect 
 She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette 
 He told her he'll be back 
 He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at 
 Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car 
 She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket 
 Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects? 
 She ain’t got no cash, and she struggling while walking 
 So I drive past, "Yo" I say "I ain’t no stalker wit yo big ole ass 
 Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift" 
 Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix 
 Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin 
  
 ('Now girl, you mean the world to me' repeats) 
  
 I’m a king, you the queen 
 His and her 6’s and diamond rings 
 You don’t have to look back at him 
 Just get your bags packed and then.. 
 A new life soon begins 
 Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Baby girl had a son 
 He was 3, yea I took him in 
 Now she call him little me, I even look like him 
 Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker 
 She be calling him Blackie..that’s cause his real father jet black 
 So she treat him like it’s a setback.. 
 I don’t respect that 
 Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number 
 Now how he get that? 
 See, now I knew we was a mismatch 
 I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked 
 I see where I went wrong at 
 I just tried to bring out the queen in you.. 
 But when you make a girl leave a man.. 
 You never really know where she stand.. 
 How you know she really yours? 
 Somebody could do the same to you..![Intro - Nas] 
 Uhh yeah yeah yo 
 It goes Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks 
 Comin' through better hide your wristwatch 
 Because niggas well live they shits pop 
 Hey hey 
 Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock 
 Light a L baby let the Crys' pop 
 Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday 
  
 [Verse 1 - Nas] 
 5'8" with double-X-L pen saggin' blunts draggin' 
 But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street 
 One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap 
 The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet 
 Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete 
 So you can be an architect design appartments and shit 
 Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip 
 Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool 
 But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze 
 Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word 
 Puff some herb, all I see is niggas runnin', chin shots 
 All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground 
 Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down 
 Now it's back to the same old shit, you know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit 
 In the jungle swingin' on vines, I saw the gat with the same old clip 
 Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dyin' 
 I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are 
 Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah 
  
 [Hook - Nas] 
 Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks 
 Comin' through better hide your wristwatch 
 Because niggas well live they shits popped 
 Hey hey 
 Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock 
 Light a L baby let the Crys' pop 
 Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday 
  
 [Verse 2 - Prodigy] 
 It's like this nigga 
 It's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big 
 While I reveal the story of a wild street kid 
 Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit 
 The spittin' image of how I live 
 Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks 
 I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen 
 Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open 
 Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot 
 Deuce deuce, had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose 
 Thug parties out in wave crash always got shot up 
 Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up 
 No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic 
 Niggas aim on the fight, we cut yo melon 
 Drinkin' that old english red bull and blue bull 
 Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke 
 Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this 
 He said: P you gon' wind up dead 
 You and Hav' real good with that music shit 
 You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street 
 And it stuck in the back of my head, though 
 I still did my little bit of menacin' 
 Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight 
 Like these things really happen niggas get cut up 
 I put it in my rappin' 
 It's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale 
 It couldn't get more graphic I'm so trail 
 I said it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale 
 City you havin' let me touch that ass 
  
 [Hook][Jessica Care Moore] 
 Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves 
 Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water 
 My skin layered in diamonds and sage 
 Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days 
 Time keeps on whorin us 
 Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us 
 Flowers and flames flew from her fingers 
 Rifles pointed from her sac 
 Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones 
 Either way, she wore a compass on her head 
 Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red 
 Her hair was half permed, half dread 
 We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced 
 Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life 
 A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice 
 Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run 
 Time travelling was late 
 Watching was a blind man's mistake 
 All his assets melted right in front of his face 
 His right leg drabbed with demon pace 
 Shoes stayed angel laced 
 Never count your blessings with haste 
 Even a prophet can catch a case 
 Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste 
 Telepathically cutting through mental gates 
 Words were weapons against their hate 
 Shepherds search for stars in her hair 
 Her chest grew fermented like yeast 
 She broke her body like aged bread 
 He gave her truth from all the books he'd read 
 She wrote her poems inside the mud 
 Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future 
 Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth 
 Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly 
 Resurrected from bones and dirt 
 She made hard niggas smile 
 Left her seeds inside the Earth 
 Gave hustlers and killers life's worth 
 This is the life we chose, remember who was here first 
 Find a reason why you curse 
 Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose 
 Sporting electronic nooses 
 Hoeing humanity love takes over lust 
 Despite the damage to Destiny 
 You can't take the best of me, In God We Still Trust[Intro] 
 You are who you associate with 
 Look around at your five closest friends 
 And that's who you are 
 If you don't want to be that person 
 You know what you gotta do 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state 
 Time waits for no man, but no man 
 Wants to die a poor man with no plan 
  
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state 
 Time waits for no man, but no man 
 Wants to die a poor man with no plan 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 You can try to kill me, but I come back 
 Hate me, that's a small thing 
 Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring 
 Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor 
 Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war 
 With my body, gravity got me 
 Police want me arrested, just to see me naked 
 Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip 
 Thugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas) 
 Wonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?) 
 Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river 
 You should watch them people with you 
 Let them street rules hit you 
 If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that 
 'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that 
 There's slugs for that 
 Oh, you didn't know your man was talking? 
 That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin 
 When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought 
 Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk 
 Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas 
 So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas 
 I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique 
 Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick 
  
 [Chorus: Nas & Stic.man] 
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state 
 Time waits for no man, but no man 
 Wants to die a poor man with no plan 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not 
 Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot 
 They can shake your hand, girl 
 Then they take your man, girl 
 The whole hood knowing 
 We got something good going 
 None of these hoes is after me 
 'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me 
 Now they wishing that they had me 
 So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with 
 You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips 
 (With a baller) after she done gave him some head 
 (He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead 
 Birds of a feather fly together 
 But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die 
 And you affiliated, now you look weak 
 'Cause your peeps is freaks 
 Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets 
 And they brought your down in the dirt 
 You was a pretty, young, smart thing 
 Going to work, I bet it hurt 
 'Cause you had a clean rep 
 But the girls you seen with make these niggas say 
 "I bet that bitch suck a mean dick", word 
  
 [Chorus: Nas & Stic.man] 
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state 
 Time waits for no woman, but no woman 
 Wants to die a poor woman with no man 
  
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state 
 Time waits for no woman, but no woman 
 Wants to die a poor woman with no man 
  
 [Verse 3: Stic.man] 
 A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne 
 Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own 
 I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth 
 Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss 
 Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down 
 Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown 
 And some only come around when everything is green 
 Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team 
 For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus 
 If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it? 
 There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly 
 Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy 
 Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant 
 My politics bosses up, for you black empowerment 
 I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent 
 Only associate with those for my betterment 
 I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines 
 Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind 
 Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through 
 And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you 
 Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly 
 If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye 
 You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew 
 I'm like Scarface: Who I trust? -- Me, that's who 
  
 [Chorus: Nas & Stic.man] 
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas 
 'til six niggas carry me 
 Poverty's a mind state

 Wants to die a poor woman with no man 
  
 Association breeds similarity 
 That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas

 [Verse 1] 
 It was '87 
 Crack money was "Ghetto Heaven" 
 Niggas gettin' it 
 Every block rise to perfection 
 Green tops, boulders and bottles 
 Soldiers who follow leaders 
 You owed 'em dollars 
 Know that tommorrow you might not see it 
 Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked 
 All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked 
 That's other niggas territory had fiends in the cheese line 
 They told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime 
 They never scared of Po-Po, was only one patrol car 
 They wasn't up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa 
 Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin' 
 But one kid was into takin' 
 Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican 
 Fort green he laid 
 First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade 
 Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood 
 Dodgin' and runnin' 
 The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin' 
 They went to war, Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake 
 Niggas got knocked by them Jakes 
 Homicide suit and tie cops, Mayor Koch, screams in rage 
 Niggas so thugs got pits rocking thick chains 
 Stick-up niggas so thug they got pits with sick names 
 Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it 
 But he was regulatin' 
 A ghetto king, now he levatatin' 
 They say he smiled in his casket 
 This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic 
  
 [Hook: repeat 2X] 
 Tales from the hood, trails of blood 
 But it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yeah I'mma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you 
 Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews 
 Top of the world's all he views 
 A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules 
 Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do 
 Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to 
 You could ball wit' me or get arrested too 
 It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands 
 Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams 
 You bought you a Lexus, BBS spendin' Abrahams 
 Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction 
 Thin line from life and death and my man checked in 
 A motel, same one as a young G he know well 
 Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run 
 But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done 
 Nobody to run to, what succumb to 
 My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street 
  
 [Hook] 
 Tales from the hood, trails of blood 
 Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should 
 Tales from the hood, trails of blood 
 Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds 
 The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list 
 Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggas would snitch 
 Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since 
 Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed 
 Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle 
 Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his 
 Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid 
 Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream 
 Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream 
 Seeing money's face starin' at him 
 In black space feelin' hands touchin' him 
 Wake up it got too much for him 
 Once liked to be alone 
 Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things 
 Now it's time to go home 
 Niggas shocked to see him 
 Gave him respect what he was missin' 
 All the way from VA his aunt yell "He hate to listen" 
 So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love 
 Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs 
 He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up 
 Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up 
 Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine 
 Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene 
  
 [Hook] 
 Tales from the hood, trails of blood 
 The book of the dead, translated in thug language, understood? 
 Tales from the hood, trails of blood 
 The book of the dead, translated in thug language, you understood[Intro: Anthony Wilson] 
 Ay yeah, what's happening mommy? How you doing baby? 
 Oh you looking kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby 
 Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me? 
 Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby 
 Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig? 
 Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness 
 You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you 
 Guess why, 'cause I'm a motherfucking pimp 
  
 [Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)] 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 I-In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, you a nigga 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, you 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 The good man in me say, "Get money and stay on the path" 
 But the pimp shit in me say, "Yo, keep looking for ass" 
 But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold 
 A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow 
 I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes 
 Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know 
 Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two 
 Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick 
 Revenge to get, against - who I don't know 
 Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake 
 They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored 
 Single breasted, a lip brush, it's senseless, some pimp shit 
 A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years 
 Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him 
 Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her 
 She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga... 
  
 [Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)] 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 I-In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, you a nigga 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, you 
  
 [Interlude: Anthony Wilson] 
 Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time 
 You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind, and get mine 
 So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know 
 Do what you gotta do man 
 Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves 
 A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is 
 Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings 
 Let's just say more than collectively all of his players 
 That's business, not really pimp shit 
 Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits 
 And not own the masters, that's the deal 
 By the way, portea helps all the Denzels excel 
 He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out 
 I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9", so fine, she could for sure grind 
 She was sleek, sheek, with a classic mouth 
 Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch 
 She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler 
 She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road 
 I showed her all my stones and gold 
 I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga" 
  
 [Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)] 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 I-In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, you a nigga 
 (Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe 
 (I be...) Staying on that paper chase 
 In this life there's pimps and hoes 
 Tell me which one are you, youNas: "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are 
 Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our 
 Heroes." 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB 
 Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's? 
 Never got Emmy's but were real to me 
 Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels 
 Cause they said they played they parts well 
 Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail 
 Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel 
 Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well" 
 Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro? 
 The acceptable Negro -- hell nah 
 But they say, "These are our heroes" 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play 
 Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud 
 But there's somethin' they don't say 
 Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay 
 From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe 
 First he played his life cool just like Michael 
 Now he rock ice too just like I do 
 Yo, you can't do better than that? 
 The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat? 
 Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back 
 Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you 
 You turn around then you shit on Shaq 
 Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes 
 He love a little butt crack, got enough cash 
 Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you 
 To do something for the youth, stupid spoof 
 But you let them use you as an example 
 They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles 
 But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through 
 But what's your excuse, dude? You talk Black 
 But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque 
 You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface 
 You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe 
 Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it 
 Huh, and in the end we all got dicked 
 These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot 
 Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks 
 Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout 
 Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson 
 Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them 
 Nicky Giovanni poetical black female 
 Jim Brown to the people who sing well from 
 Fela to Miriam Makeba 
 The mirror says you are the next American leader 
 So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records 
 These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records 
 Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC 
 But next year, who knows what we'll see? 
 Ha-Ha, these are our heroes 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas:] "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know 
 The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard 
 Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up 
 To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs 
 What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit 
 And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit." 
  
 [Male Heckler:] "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though 
 Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at 
 All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in 
 My hood. What type of shit is that?" 
  
 [Overlapping dialogue] 
  
 [Nas:] "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please 
 Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I 
 Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha 
 Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE." 
  
 [Thug Heckler:] "Come on man, give back to the hood. Cocky 
 Motherfucker!"[Verse 1] 
 I wouldn't marry a black woman here's the reason why 
 (Why) 
 Black women's evil, do things on the sly 
 (No) 
 You look for your supper to be good and hot 
 (Hot) 
 She never put the neck bone in the pot 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 She's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (She's on the road again) 
 She's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (On the road again) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I went to my window, my window was propped 
 I went to my door, my door was locked 
 I stepped right back, I shook my head 
 A big black nigga's in my folding bed 
 I shot through the window, I broke the glass 
 I never seen a little nigga run so fast 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 He's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (On the road again) 
 He's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 God, a natural-born eastman 
 (On the road again) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Your friend at your house just to rest his hat 
 Next thing he wanna know where your husband's at 
 She says "I don't know he's on his way to the pen" 
 Come on mama, let's get on the road again 
  
 [Hook 3] 
 She's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (She's on the road again) 
 He's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (On the road again) 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I'm with my black woman let me tell you 
 (Why) 
 Black women's evil, do things on the sly 
 (No) 
 You look for your supper to be good and hot 
 (Hot) 
 She never put the neck bone in the pot 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 She's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (She's on the road again) 
 She's on the road again 
 (Just as sure as you're born) 
 Lord, a natural-born eastman 
 (On the road again) 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah! 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah[Intro:] 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 (Whose world is this?) 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged 
 Writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
 To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement 
 Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with 
 The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right 
 The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe 
 The mind activation, react like I'm facing 
 Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing 
 Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets 
 And the Nikes on my feet keep my cipher complete 
 Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep 
 I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep 
 I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (take money!) 
 I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me 
  
 [Hook:] 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The world is yours 
 Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Yea, the world is yours 
 To the Philly blunt-heads, crack pumping drug murderers 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The world is yours 
 To my niggas coming home from lockdown with new plans 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Fuck it, the world is mine, holding the stolen cop's Glock with G notes in my hand 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 To my man Ill Will, God bless your life 
 To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life 
 My insight enlights vision words of wisdom 
 Niggas pay me in tuition to listen 
 The murder paragraphs of mysticism 
 Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds 
 So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free 
 Son I need weed to proceed 
 Change the flow speed 
 I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666 
 There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays 
 I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed 
 Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle 
 The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso 
 And yo, the trife life is most influential 
 The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental 
 How you livin', large or broker 
 You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers 
 Catchin' court papers gettin' broker 
  
 [Hook 2:] 
 The world is mine 
 Persona of late Tony Montana, yea gettin' mine 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 The whole world is mine, who wanted? 
 I never fronted, I'm forever blunted, getting lye 
 Henne up with the lye, never stop, we don't stop the - henne low, puffin' lye ya'll 
 Don't stop the henne low, we puff the lye, everyday puffin' lye, plus the henne low 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed 
 For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded 
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne 
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home 
 I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow 
 Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow 
 Trying to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip 
 Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip 
 And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs 
 Headed for Indiana, stabbing bitches like the Phantom 
 The crew is lampin', Ill Will style 
 Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild 
 Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stove 
 Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames 
 Plus the games people play 
 I check the dames plus the games people play 
 Bust the problems of the world today 
  
 [Outro:] 
 (Whose world is this?) 
 Yea, Wizard, keep that lye in the air, yo 
 I wanna give a shoutout to the whole fucking Queens 
 My man Tipster on the boards, keeping it real lord 
 The Queensbridge nation, get it on 
 Faking no fucking jacks 
 Fuck around get your wig pushed back 
 Big shoutout to my man killa, Ron do is on you 
 L-A-S is on another murder quest 
 '94, we out 
 Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere 
 (La-la-la-la-la-la) 
 Keep the la-la going 
 (La-la-la-la-la-la)[Hook] 
 I know all of y'all hear me, none of y'all scare me 
 Cause niggas die daily 
 Coming out with my guns real early 
 Laying in your stairway, cause niggas die daily 
 So I got niggas around you 
 Mad like they're back for their man 
 You've killed just a year ago today 
 So call it a death anniversary 
 Rushing to emergency, niggas die daily 
  
 [Nas] 
 What if I told you that AZ didn't exist 
 And I put him there, played it like a ventriloquist 
 Cause niggas spit fake shit and y'all respect it 
 I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record 
 What if me and the rapper homey was really cool 
 And we used that whole thing as a media tool 
 Would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy 
 If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married? 
 What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate 
 And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment 
 What if I really died when Ill Will got shot 
 This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac 
 What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way 
 And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play 
 I'd have to load another AK cause niggas be jealous 
 Cause we real like them Brazil favelas 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 Scream at the nigga "breathe don't breathe your last breath" 
 But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself 
 Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em 
 Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em 
 Loosen up the nine out of his fingers 
 Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing 
 And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B 
 This your niggas first year anniversary 
 This how it goes down in every ghetto 
 So it's quite natural for rappers to settle 
 And make pop music, nursery hooks 
 Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks 
 They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first 
 I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth 
 The next anniversary we all unite 
 Let's all get together or we're loosing the fight 
  
 [Hook][Intro: Swizz Beatz] 
 Swizzy! 
 Wherever you are (Shine) 
 Whoever you are (Shine) 
 Wherever you are (Shine) 
 Whoever you are (Shine) 
 Wherever you are (Shine) 
 Whoever you are (Shine) 
 Hey, Hey, I told ya 
  
 [Hook] 
 Ridin’ with my top down, and my jewelry on 
 Hey, I’m just getting my hood on 
 I’m just, I’m just, doing my thing 
 I’m just, I’m just, (pimp) doing my thing 
 Hey (yup) hey (yup) hey (yup) hey 
 I said I’m ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on 
 Hey, I’m just getting my hood on 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 It’s the late night greasy spoon patron 
 Poolhall making 
 Big bets, midsection got the 8 in 
 Dior Christian pimpin’ 
 Got that penal system diction 
 Riffing, you don’t want it you snitchin’ 
 Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR 
 Try to kill me I’m the leader, that’s coup d’etat 
 Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black 
 Bitches want my chipped tooth back 
 Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked 
 Squeeze the fifth with a grip as I dip 
 From the paparazzi 
 Still playing numbers (you can’t stop me) 
 Still wearing bundles, and spark weed 
 If I ever say “Queens get ‘em”, you know they got me 
 Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef 
 So lead by example, or get trampled 
 Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the end 
 Congratulations in order ’cause we did it again 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The chain’s offensive 
 Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage 
 The two Tec Don in Yukon’s and Benzes 
 Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants 
 The Apprentice but not Trump 
 I’m the nigga with Glocks and pumps 
 That you don’t see much 
 Sucker free from chumps 
 Homes with cobblestones in front of ‘em 
 He’s got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son 
 Don’t make me have you running from a hundred guns 
 Don’t make me grab your only son 
 I’m coming from 
 A place Tanqueray and weed’s the only escape 
 From phonies who hate 
 When you rolling with papes 
 That’s why the God party with juicy models 
 They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano – hardly 
 Have to tell y’all, I kill y’all 
 For spitting songs that involve me nigga 
 Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I got the armour tucked with the no drama luck 
 Tatted up, everywhere, my neck, arms and stuff 
 Like I roll my body around on wet comic books 
 The Dalai Lama prodded up, lighting chronic up 
 Ugh, of course I’m at it again 
 When I do it you know N, I throw caution to the wind 
 I talk about the life I’m in 
 But I swear to God I may never write again 
 But if I hit em hard, they say the World must kneel 
 Baddest girls gon lick my Tim’ boot heel 
 Sayin’ Nas running out of time 
 This is my last chance 
 Gotta shoots to kill, this is my last dance 
 I say hell nah, don dadda 
 Goons act fly, fly swat ya 
 Rapping ducks, modern day dracula’s 
 What you coming out your caskets for 
 This game been dead but guess who came back for more 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 This is a Core DJ Exclusive.... 
  
 [Nas] 
 Ayo, check it out, this is Nas 
 Is Hip-Hop dead or is it still alive? Ha ha 
 Well, check it out 
 Right about now, I'm ridin' with my homies from the Westside 
 (West Coast) 
 Showin' love 
 (West Coast) 
 I asked where are they now? 
 (West Coast) 
 2007, they right here, yeah 
 (Where are they now?) 
  
 [Breeze] 
 Yo, it's time to rhyme, keep it in mind, I'm gifted 
 With the strength to go the length, and if it’s 
 Rough enough to keep the crowd wonderin' 
 Breeze and L.A. Posse (Where are they now?) 
 Still layin' in the land of the palm trees 
 Warm breeze, sippin' on Dom P, still chillin' with King T 
 Slowed on MCin’, pass the series green 
 Gettin' money off the words I spit, yet still gee-in' 
 Still the young son but now a nigga got a baby girl 
 Tryin’ to raise her right and guide her through this crazy world 
 Still got a slow flow and fast raps know 
 Reppin' twenty years, still gettin' ASCAP checks 
 Still, spittin' the truth when I mentor the youth 
 On how to be professional when they step in the booth 
 And never cuppin' the mic so you can hear me clear 
 Nas wondered, yo, where are they now? 
 I'm right here, G 
  
 [KAM] 
 Goddamn, that nigga KAM back on the scene 
 With the O.G. West on the same team 
 Hittin' corners in a Six-Trey Chevrolet 
 Ragtop Impala, gettin' dollars every day 
 For pushin' heavy yay to this rap shit 
 Fuckin' with niggas I done put L.A. on the map wit’ 
 So that the legacy lasts long 
 We're givin' it up for all the homies that done passed on 
 And you can check Bobcat’s file 
 He can tell you who we are, what we did and where we at now 
 This bullshit, niggas tired of that 
 Fools runnin' they mouth, so where the Southside riders at? 
  
 [Hook: Breeze, KAM, Nas, King T] 
 Everybody’s talkin' about the South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 (West Coast) 
 Everybody talkin' about this South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 West Coast, yeah, Nas's ridin' with you right here 
 (The who?) 
 West Coast 
  
 [King T] 
 Hey, watch it resurrect from the jump 
 House shoes, Khaki suit, riot gauge pump 
 Black Raider hat with ‘Bitch Please’ on the side 
 Central and Greenleaf, 1989 
 Just in time, King T pushed the line 
 The G's had to have it, Eazy and Dre had it 
 I was a damn fool, now dudes wanna act it 
 (Where are they now?) He's still active 
 We go back like the Jheri Curl shag 
 When Pooh was from the Gate, Bobcat was from the Aves 
 I was in that green 6-4 with the rag pull back in slow motion 
 T-La showboatin' 
 They lookin' for that West Coast Trojan 
 Thought to be in exile but I'm just posted 
 Blessed to be the best to crack the West Coast open 
 King T-La back, muthafucka, it's a wrap 
  
 [Candyman] 
 The C-A- to the N-D-Y-The-M-A-N 
 I still melt in your mouth, not in your hand 
 I love to hear the story, again and again 
 But it originated from this man, The Candyman 
 Damn, it feels good to hear my West Coast peers 
 Makes me wanna shed a tear for the ones who ain't here 
 I was just a young player in these Westside streets 
 Motivated to be innovative like Ice-T 
 King T, Toddy Tee 
 R.I.P. to Mixmaster Spade, MC Trouble, Rudy Pardee 
 And it's a trip to witness trap rap 
 When I’m on the first album cover with Eazy-E doin' that shit way back 
 Hell yeah, we need a new West, Dirty South respects 
 I remember doin' shows out there 
 They never tripped off the Westside 
 Spend all their chips at the Best Buy 
 Groovin' like they just don't care 
  
 [Threat] 
 No mistakes, can’t get away 
 Dumpin' with them funky rhymes 
 Yep, that's MC Deadly Threat 
 They play him on the radio all the time 
 I love my folks, I love my G's 
 They can't kill Cali, they love my weed 
 West Coast done it, East Coast did it 
 Then the South came wit’ it like ‘let's go get it’ 
 Red Ghost did it like the ones before me 
 The batterram came and took all the glory 
 I got an Army like Uncle Jamm’s 
 K-D-A-Y bumped the jam 
 Bobcat, Battlecat and DJ Pooh 
 L.A., S.C., but we say Zuu 
 It still never rain or snow in Cali 
 We're gettin' blunted in the back of the bowling alley, like.. 
  
 [Hook: Breeze, KAM] 
 Everybody’s talkin' about the South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 (West Coast) 
 Everybody talkin' about the South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 Where are they now? 
  
 [Ice-T] 
 This is it, dope from the fly kid 
 Iceberg bang for the West, servin' a life bid 
 Westside nigga for life, ride or die 
 I get so gangsta, I stay so fly 
 Saggin' my Khakis, reppin' my flag 
 Nigga, break out the gun, bitch, let's play tag 
 Every day in the street, somebody calls me Cube 
 I tell ‘em that's my loved one, but it’s Ice-T, dude 
 I come from that Crenshaw strip, ya heard? 
 It’s way Cripped up, chrome when the 6-4 lift up 
 It's hard to rock a party, L.A. don't like nobody 
 Niggas rather pop the trunks and dump shotties 
  
 [Sir Mix-A-Lot] 
 I'mma show my nigga Nas what I got in my garage 
 Yeah, my publishin' is large, water fountains in my yard 
 The Posse left Broadway to get ‘em on the glass 
 I got class, but still I like a fat ass 
 Mix-A-Lot sheenin' with this S-Class gleamin' 
 Aggressive pimp leanin’, marked the game like a demon 
 From TVs to movies, Hollywood use my shit 
 Seven-figure years keep comin’. Who's your pimp? 
 F430 with these black paddle shifters 
 This may not uplift ya but I'm still takin' pictures 
 And I'm lovin' all you sisters, Mix'll never disrespect ya 
 Westside vet; you need your paper? I'll connect ya 
  
 [Hook: CMG from The Conscious Daughters] 
 Everybody’s talkin' about the South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 (West Coast) 
 Everybody is talkin' about the South and the East Coast 
 But what about the West Coast? 
 (The who?) 
 The West Coast 
  
 [CMG from The Conscious Daughters] 
 It's the rhyme-spittin' kitten you’re never hittin’ 
 The legendary, all-time great phenomenal female 
 Monarch, hittin' charts 
 Flowamatic nine spitta shoot like darts, blowin' bitches apart 
 It's The Conscious Daughters, still stompin' over soil 
 Holla at your folks, the females is royal 
 Bay Area OGs, still gettin' cheese 
 Like we sidin' on the block with 'Pac and Eazy-E[Verse 1: Quan] 
 Can we please have a moment of silence? 
 That's for my niggas doin' years in confinement 
 And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living 
 That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em 
 Can we please pour out some liquor? 
 Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that 
 Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here 
 And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here 
 This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain 
 Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine 
 Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by 
 To live it alive, so instead they live it to die 
 Can we please have a moment of peace? 
 For every G that fell for his flag in the streets 
 Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin' 
 Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin' 
 Or just for poor righteous teachin' 
  
 [Hook: Quan sings] 
 As days goes and nights fall 
 For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all 
 And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn 
 While wishin' y'all were home 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence? 
 For brothers who died from black-on-black violence 
 From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds 
 To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin' 
 And can we please pour some more liquors? 
 For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggas 
 Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan 
 It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on 
 Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets 
 And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest 
 And can we please have a moment of truth? 
 For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots 
 And families back home who pray they make it home safe 
 Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles 
 This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you 
 Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you 
 Let's take 'em home 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Quan] 
 And can we please have a moment to mourn? 
 For Pac, Biggie and Pun cause through us they live on 
 Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah 
 Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya... 
  
 [Nas] 
 Photographs of lost memories 
 On the blocks with blunts and Hennessey 
 Picture some niggas in mock neck shirts 
 Ballantine Ale in brown bags 
 Brothers like to brag 'bout their cousins 
 That locked in the system 
 We all fall victims, we all call Christian 
 Or Islamic faith, to restore all our faith 
 Barbed wire and tall brick wall 
 But we all can escape

 Afterlife (Intro) 
  
 Almost Kings[Verse 1] 
 Queensbridge, 41st side 
 Yo yo yo 
 I gots no birth records, no next of kin 
 Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends 
 Know the weather checkin 1010 WINS AM 
 First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing 
 Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin 
 Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose 
 I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas 
 Keep showin y'all what difficult is 
 Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge 
 What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it 
 Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses 
 Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions 
 I repeat this is not a question 
 If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em 
 Keep the Glock by the intestines, .38 waist 
 Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell 
  
 [Hook] 
 Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this) 
 There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me) 
 I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew) 
 We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong) 
 We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles) 
 Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that) 
 We want it dead and want it now (We want it now) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes 
 Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes 
 Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood 
 And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food 
 Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes 
 Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain 
 I rap for math, english, even rap for science 
 Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin 
 I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets 
 It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex 
 New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her 
 Rappin got me two proper nuts 
 It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach 
 White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates 
 Creamed out, dope stashin 
 For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo 
 Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts 
 Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops 
 Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged 
 In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed 
 Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom 
 Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours 
 I watch the game like it's Saint John's 
 It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs 
 Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do 
 In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move 
 Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure 
 Once I quit, niggas wanted more 
 Cop my shit once it come in store 
 The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off 
 Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts 
 One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse 
  
 [Hook[Intro: Nas & Maxwell] 
 *Oooooooooooh!* 
 Maxwell go and sing 
 *Ooohh, this for the ladies* 
 M-A-X 
 *Doin' it* 
 N-A-S 
 *I'm back again (who's back) 
 Again, again, I'm back again (who's back) 
 Ooh, tell me (who's back) 
 I'm back again (who's back) 
 Again, again, I'm back again* 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, yeah the booty is the bass 
 The highs, the beauty in ya eyes 
 First glance I became alive 
 She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise 
 Now she would decide on Nas 
 Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me 
 In the party, it was a early day a March 
 When I first had ya legs arched 
 In the park, wasn't even dark 
 We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch 
 Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked 
 She said till you get enough, please don't stop 
 So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot 
 If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top 
 My hair cut look air brushed 
 Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks 
 As we sashayed across the dance floor 
 Just, me and you no one else but us two 
  
 [Hook: Maxwell] 
 No other girl in the room 
 No other girl in the room but you 
 (There's no other girl lookin' as good as you) 
 There's nobody but you 
 (They can try, they can try) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (But you know, you know, you know) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (Oh, oh, ooo ooo) 
 No other girl in the room but you 
 (There's no other girl, no) 
 There's nobody but you 
 (They try) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (There's nobody to,) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall 
 A super freak as my thoughts revolved 
 It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway 
 Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip Jose 
 On our honeymoon everyday 
 We dance to the same tune everyday 
 Beauty and the goon they would say 
 You promise, savage beast 
 You a sexy freak 
 Your moist lips negates the ecstacy 
 Number one in my book, no discrepancy 
 When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me 
 I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe 
 No matter what's going on around us 
 All I could hear was the sound of (her) 
 Twirlin' her around just (her) 
 See nobody in the crowd just (her) 
  
 [Hook: Maxwell] 
 (No other) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (No one) 
 No other girl in the room but you 
 (There's no other girl) 
 There's nobody but you 
 (Thinkin' about you baby, baby) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (Never ever, ever, ever, see you) 
 No other girl in the room 
 (Oh) 
 No other girl in the room but you 
 (No other girl has, they're not you) 
 There's nobody but you 
 (Oooh baby yeah) 
 No other girl in the room 
  
 [Bridge: Nas] 
 Uh, horns! 
 Clap 
 Everybody clap 
 C'mon, clap 
 Max mellow 'em out 
  
 [Maxwell] 
 Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl 
 Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you 
 Just you, just me, no one else but you 
 No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe 
  
 [Nas] 
 Clap! Break it down 
  
 [Olu Dara] 
 You know it all comes from Africa 
 But my version is the blues[Intro: Nas] 
 Yo this Nas niggas whuttup? 
 QB Album coming, niggas Ill Will, Bravehearts 
 My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas 
 Desert Storm baby 2000! 
  
 [Nas] 
 A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game 
 Cause entertainment money now is off the chain 
 I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game 
 I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game 
 But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death 
 Energy could neva be destroyed 
 Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me 
 With bullets to my head 
 This is my you can't kill me niggas 
 I'm already dead, BRING IT!! 
 I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery 
 Black blood raining on the street 
 All you niggas, buried y'all 
 Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens 
 Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens 
 It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal 
 Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison 
 Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan 
 But thought I was dreaming 
 I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons 
 I cried with every bit of strength of my small body 
 This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny 
 Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up 
 You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck 
 You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave 
 Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade 
 You're on top -- WHAT? 
 Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated 
 Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated 
 Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead 
 He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs 
 'Stillmatic', still eye 4 an eye, wanna be God 
 You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas[Intro: Nature] 
  
 [Verse 1: Nature] 
 Y'all know my pedigree, hoes blow the gods voluntarily 
 We're world wide, my heart pumps where the ghettos be 
 Young sharks be telling me, y'all niggas can't swim, y'all drowning 
 From my hood to your hood, the anthem, y'all wilding 
 I die for my coalition, the foes whispering 
 Hating, Wild Gremlins and those that roll with 'em 
 So I chose rap, we vamped to neva go back 
 Until this life of animosity, the high velocity 
 Niggas be on the same team planning to blow shots at me 
 Be the same mouths I try to feed 
 I write shit, entice it properly, 'til it hurts me 
 The same game as James Worthy, they spread my name like it's Herpes 
 Nature, niggas on the block boxing me, y'all not complete 
 We take this shit to where it gots to be, now smile philosophy 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Sex and money go together like techs and nine shells 
 Swiss cheese you and cover it up like Roswell 
 Cartel, you ain't seen no iller regime 
 The Celest team, prophecy, project warrior, owns property 
 Crackers hate it, cops get jealous cause I stay with 
 The '98 temporary plates on my whip 
 The system thing is not right 
 A rich thug could fuck a cop's wife 
 Cause I'm on television and live the pop life 
 I rock mics, make mills, sound scan sales 
 One point whateva records, professional skills 
 Money's the root of evil but it'll make you happy 
 Don't wanna shoot my people but still they might clap me 
 Cause I talk like Dr. Malachi york, played the sidewalk 
 Hold fort, diamond plate chain, gold fork 
 Get in tune, rich life Ricky for silver spoon 
 Frank Lopez's crib, elevators and living room 
  
 [Verse 3: Noreaga] 
 Ayo we're still in Queens, same place where we use to be 
 Often you won't see us, cause we're usually out touring 
 Leave the hood now the hood boring 
 NORE, you know me, we're regulating 
 Straight from Iraq with QB affiliated 
 It's like a higher learning 
 From 99th street down to Vernon 
 Letting our heat burst burning 
 Like henny wet, throwing up my set 
 Catch me on star tec, 'bout to set the connect 
 Yo sex, drugs, money and murder, beers and sex 
 Lands and Lex in the projects 
 The 4th floor where we score through our cook-up 
 D's shook-up, hit the block and now you look up 
  
 [Verse 4: Nature] 
 Whispers turning to screams, from screams to hollers 
 Fans turn to fanatics, go home and dream about us 
 My zone, I need the chronic, my habit daily 
 Spitting, rapping fury, I got more steps then Alvin Ailey 
 Thousands will feel me, my nickname Braille 
 Dietec, the fakest niggas, cause their cliques ain't real 
 Each verse be pain filled, force to taking Motrin's 
 From the street to the screen, pictures be major motion 
 Nature grossing, holding my square where snake's approaching 
 React quickly, keeping gats where my dick be 
 A buck equal a hundred, so a half is fifty 
 Y'all do the math with me, before I hurt you 
 It's personal, you and I know, my whole squad be U-N-I-versal 
 From blood in to blood out, we thugged out 
 Fuck a four-four, I go to snub route, leave you rubbed out 
  
 [Verse 5: Nas] 
 Death followed him, before it swallowed him whole 
 It was signs he should of read that was inside his soul 
 Niggas light dutches to 'em now 
 So long miss a mutha fucka but still life goes on 
 Hope I'm rich on my last day, clutching some ass 
 Nigga said he came in with, got a nut when he passed 
 An old man laying dead on my bed, with some young shit 
 Screaming out "freedom" when I slumped her chest 
 After that, chill, be a bitch with a hex 
 Every nigga she sexed, be the next put to rest 
  
 [Verse 6: Noreaga] 
 Yo since a young sibling, had every flavor Timberland 
 Always had a jump shot and always dribbling 
 John McEnroe, Jose lay like Casserole 
 Doling Mike Tys', the jungle low, cut the china white 
 Come check ya, mixed the henny with the nectars 
 On straight flights while y'all cats connectors 
 If it was up to me, the whole world would be comfortably 
 But since its not, y'all niggas stay fucked up 
 I think about y'all too much and be bankrupted 
 So niggas get yours, I got mines niggas, so what, what? 
  
 [Outro][Spoken: Nas] 
 Twenty years in the making 
 What was I thinking? 
 1992, wow 
 I wasn't sure how to get into the rap game 
 The incredible rap game 
 It's all a dream 
 It's time, and when that time came 
 I took it 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Rappers, I monkey flip 'em, with the funky rhythm I be kickin' 
 Musician, inflictin' composition of pain 
 I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine 
 Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme 
 Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes 
 I'm suited up in street clothes 
 Hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes 
 Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay 
 I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway 
 Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs 
 Laughin' at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps 
 G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk 
 Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped 
 Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin' 
 Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston 
 Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass and 
 I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin 
 Picked the MAC up, told brothers, "Back up!" — the MAC spit 
 Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip 
 Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look 
 Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!" 
 It wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger 
 Pulled my shit back and saw 
 Three bullets caught up in the chamber 
 Now I'm runnin' to the building lobby 
 And it was full of children prob'ly, couldn't see as high as I be 
 (So what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same 
 Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name 
 Claim some corners, crews without guns are goners 
 In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us 
 45's and gauges, MAC's in fact 
 Same niggas will catch you back-to-back 
 Snatchin' your cracks in black 
 There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked 
 So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop 
 I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock 
 And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots 
 But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation 
 Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin' 
 It drops deep as it does in my breath 
 I never sleep—‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined 
 I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "New York state of mind" 
 "New York state of mind" 
 Where I live, where I'm at 
 "New York state of mind" 
 "New York state of mind" 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta 
 Drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's 
 Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped 
 Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks 
 Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops 
 But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger 
 Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' 
 Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have brothers undressin' 
 Thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter 
 Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta 
 In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays 
 Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze 
 Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed 
 From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back 
 Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black 
 The fiends fight to get crack 
 I just max, I dream I can sit back 
 And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn 
 Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes 
 I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane 
 Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain 
 And be prosperous, though we live dangerous 
 Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages 
 It's only right that I was born to use mics 
 And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes 
 I've taken rappers to a new plateau 
 Through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule 
 The smooth criminal on beat breaks 
 Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes 
 The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps 
 That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks 
 I'm an addict for sneakers 
 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers 
 In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya 
 Inhale deep like the words of my breath 
 I never sleep—‘cause sleep is the cousin of death 
 I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times 
 Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "New York state of mind" 
 "New York state of mind" 
 Where I live, where I'm at 
 "New York state of mind" 
 "New York state of mind" 
  
 [Nas] 
 But tonight, tonight 
 In the D.C state of mind 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Detonize, come on 
 Detonize what 
 Detonize all 
  
 [Spoken: Nas] 
 Thank you 
 20 years ago, I was writing that rhyme in a small apartment, in a small room, inside that small apartment. Just living in a world that I knew, talking about the things that I see and live man. You know, teenagers' mind is wild[Nas] 
 Peace, how are you? 
 I ain't mean to be late 
 It was my night to watch my little girl 
 It's chilly out here 
 What happened? You crying? 
 Y'all got into it again huh? 
 See you gotta let them know from the jump 
 I don't care who they are, or who they're with 
 Yeah I know they know we're talking 
 Shh, why don't they just leave us alone? 
 I know it's hard for them to understand people like us 
 Could love each other 
 Come on, stop crying now 
 Oh, there's something I gotta tell you 
 I heard they're watching you 
 Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too 
 But there ain't no reason to get low 
 I'm proud, I'm here 
 You know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what 
 And I know you'll stand up for me 
 I don't have no doubts about you being true to me 
 The world is ours 
 But right now it feels like the whole world is against us 
 So study, be strong, don't cry no more 
  
 *Immediately follows A Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People*[Verse 1: Nas] 
 You cocked back 
 You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man 
 He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man 
 You missed him by inches, he sprinted 
 Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered 
 Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished 
 You took the life of him 
 The part about it that's crazy, you was aiight with him 
 Tight with him, why was he in the way? 
 Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day? 
 His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive 
 Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit 
 Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised 
 Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days 
 They never had no probs 
 Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage 
 These two different personalities had to collide 
 Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died 
 You ask why, cause of a 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose 
 Liars brag, you put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Streets are full of them, read the bulletin 
 Accident murderer 
 You just a accident murderer 
  
 [Verse 2: Rick Ross] 
 We grew up doin' graffiti 
 Now hollows is gettin' heated 
 Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded 
 Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars 
 But fuck 'em all, we ballin' 'til they come lock us up 
 Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight 
 We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night 
 Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war 
 Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah 
 Memoirs of a rich nigga 
 Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers 
 New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer 
 You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo 
 Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique 
 Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips 
 In a hole, sell your home nigga don't sell your soul 
 This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge: Nas] 
 Accident murderer, accident murderer 
 You just an accident murderer 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up 
 Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya 
 And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome 
 How they gon' kill that beautiful sista? 
 Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons 
 Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin' 
 Tell me who you impressin'? 
 Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them 
 Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' wrestlin' 
 Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin' 
 But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went 
 Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas 
 Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless 
 Wish I could build with him, but will he change really? 
 Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry 
 Fake 'til my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me 
 You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 4: Ryan Leslie] 
 Born on June 4th - the mind of a Gemini 
 Plight of a societal OutKast - Aquemeni 
 You bought a hammer just to silence the clamour 
 For another real G on the block, after your man got popped 
 When shots rang out, you ran for cover 
 Bought your first gun, spent a couple grand for another four 
 Told your mom you was preparing for war 
 She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door 
 But you ain't never had the mind of a killer 
 You was more of an actor - with the movement of a small time dealer 
 When the feds came they got you for light work 
 Facing a few years, defence attorney told you it might work 
 To cop a plea and turn informant - you could save a few tenants 
 And at the same time reduce your sentence 
 You wore a wire to the home of your old supplier 
 And when they raided, you ain't make it - you was caught in the fire 
 Of an accident murderer 
  
 [Hook]I came from the city 
 Yeah, got my name from the city 
 Where? The most dangerous city 
 Let's take a trip back, back into time 
 1977, it was maximum crime 
 The President neglected us, him and 6 masterminds 
 6 powerful men put New York through some drastic times 
 The rich and selfish ones, feed off the welfare ones 
 And which borough suffered the worst? Hmm, where I'm from 
 The Bronx 
 We had to rumble with rivals on the rubble 
 While buildings around us would crumble 
 I dreamed right but it seemed like nothin' found me but trouble 
 I see the light, it's right there at the end of the tunnel 
 Had to find my rope, to pull me up 
 Cause I needed some kind of hope, to fill me up 
 'Til I met one guy, took me under the wing 
 I could have died if this man ain't intervene 
 He was an orphan, my savior, free spirited 
 No man braver, he was honored and gifted 
 His name was Shaolin Fantastic, the lady-killin' romantic 
 Can't forget the day we met, and this story recants it 
 But yo my life began last year, sophomore of high school 
 That summer I saw her, said to myself, "She'll be my wife soon"[Intro] 
 It's yours 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged 
 Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
 To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement 
 Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with 
 The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right 
 The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe 
 The mind activation, react like I'm facing time like 
 Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing 
 Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets 
 And the Nikes on my feet makes my cipher complete 
 Whether cruising in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep 
 I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep 
 I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me 
 I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me 
  
 [Hook] 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 To my man Ill Will, God bless your life 
 To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life 
 My insight enlights vision words of wisdom 
 Niggas pay me in tuition to listen 
 The murder paragraphs of mysticism 
 Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds 
 So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free 
 Son I need weed to proceed 
 Change the flow speed 
 I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666 
 There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays 
 I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed 
 Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle 
 The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso 
 And yo, the trife life is most influential 
 The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental 
 How you livin', large or broker 
 You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers 
 Catchin' court papers gettin' broker 
  
 [Hook] 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed 
 For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded 
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne 
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home 
 I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow 
 Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow 
 Trying to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip 
 Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip 
 And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs 
 Headed for Indiana, stabbing bitches like the Phantom 
 The crew is lampin', Ill Will style 
 Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild 
 Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stove 
 Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames 
 Plus the games people play 
 I check the dames plus the games people play 
 Bust the problems of the world today 
  
 [Hook] 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world is this 
 The world is yours, the world is yours

 [Nas] 
 I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces 
 Check out my jewelry piled in your faces 
 Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave 
 Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze 
 It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to masochist 
 Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world, I laugh as if 
 Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you 
 But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you 
 Fallen angel after them halos 
 Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow 
 Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like Entenmann's and Breyers 
 The flyest 
  
 [Hook] 
 You got to be the flyest 
 I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them 
 Jeans, but you can work it like that 
 You got to be the flyest 
 You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps 
 Cause you can work it like that 
 You got to be the flyest 
 You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair 
 Cause you can work it like that 
 You got to be the flyest 
 You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but 
 You work it like that 
  
 [Nas] 
 Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow 
 Your CD needs me, keep it kickin' like Del Greco 
 Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know 
 For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe 
 Spandex for money, I stay on the tight 
 G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight 
 Elbow out the left window, K's on the right 
 Canary out her ears, you know she playing them right 
 Hilton style, Billionaire Boys club 
 Braveheart, y'all don't want no war with us 
 Dump a semi out a Maybach, I made girls bust 
 When I hit them full thrust, full throttle 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Nas] 
 Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life 
 To move an eight, every night was my passion 
 Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces 
 Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses 
 I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough 
 Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin' 
 It's at my mind, just a mystery school 
 Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools 
 Mami hit me with some moves 
 I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters 
 Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants 
 I been okay with these warmers 
 Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Move your waist girl.. Yeah yeah (x2) 
 You got to be Nas's Angel 
 You can be Charlie's Angel 
 You can be Nas's Angel[NAS] 
 In my darkest days lighting up the rightous smoke 
 Cause I'm dealing with this thug life crisis and can't cope 
 Niggas on my dick beef don't stop 
 Niggas asking what happed to the Firm 
 Did you and AZ bone Fox? No 
 How was it working with Dre though? 
 Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on 
 There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart 
 The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don 
 Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's? 
 Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of 
 Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life 
 Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife 
 It's true, me and 2 PAC once steped to each other 
 Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers 
 As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base 
 I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard 
 What your hearing is a replica 
 I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses 
 Double edges playing both sides of the fences 
  
 [Hook] [Nas & Lake] 
 Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug? 
 One never knows do one 
 The things that I've seen in the streets I'm from 
 One never knows do one 
 The stuff that I've done what I've become 
 One never knows do one 
 Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what? 
 One never knows... 
  
 [LAKE] 
 The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face 
 And did he really shoot at the Jake's? 
 When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace 
 Why was Lake name mentioned? 
 Was he reppin on the island taking phone time? 
 Did he get Prodigy his chain back in "99"? 
 Who's writing his rhymes? He is 
 Do he be with Kingpin like Delson and Jesus, What was he thinking? 
 On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler 
 Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge? 
 Why his last case made the daily news in June? 
 Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem? 
 Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects? 
 Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off

 [Verse 1] 
 Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit 
 On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot 
 Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas 
 Little kids scared cops, wit red dots 
 Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors 
 Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers 
 Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires 
 Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin' on 
 Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up 
 And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em 
 Cops see them and run, don't want no drama 
 Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of 
 Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota 
 Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace 
 He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians 
 From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts 
 Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh 
 Lightning hits the top of the church steeple 
 When I'm writin', semi-automatic no hyphen 
 It's frightening.... {*scratches*} 
  
 [Hook] 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I take summers off, cause I love winter beef 
 Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep 
 Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill 
 Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd 
 Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth 
 Woolrich, Carhartt, gun powder stains 
 Smellin' like trees, sensimille on the brain 
 Skeemin' on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain 
 Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap 
 Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks 
 Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises 
 Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys and, it's 
 .... Just another day in the hood 
 And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good 
 We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em 
 But our style was let them pile then, we robbin' 'em 
 Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes 
 Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin' 
 And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life 
 For the thief's who come out at night 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro]

 {*explosion*}Yo this Nas niggas whuttup? 
 QB Album coming, niggas ill Will, Bravehearts 
 My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas 
 Desert Storm baby 2000! 
  
 A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki, get out the game 
 Cause entertainment money now is off the chain 
 I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game 
 I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game 
 But I'm never gon' die, I never heard of death 
 Energy could never be destroyed, only the flesh 
 So when you niggas try to murder me with bullets to my head 
 This is why you can't kill me niggas I'm already dead, BRING IT! 
 I'm busting, bodies fall in the cemetery 
 Black blood raining on the street 
 All you niggas, buried y'all! 
 Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens 
 Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens 
 It's pitiful - what a bid could do, especially federal 
 Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison 
 Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan 
 But thought I was dreaming 
 I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons 
 I cried with every bit of strength of my small body 
 This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny 
 Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up 
 You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck 
 You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave 
 Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade 
 You on top - WHAT? 
 Copying fuck, I said it first, you repeated 
 Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated 
 Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead 
 He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs 
 Still-matic, still eye 4 an eye, wannabe God 
 You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with NasNow on July 13th, 1977 
 The blackout, streets is lookin' like Armageddon 
 Swelterin' heat, suffocate in this Hell within' the 5 boroughs 
 It's like the Sun roastin' the Earth 
 The hood was called turf, my girl was thrown out of her church 
 Out of her home, and by her family, she's disowned 
  
 She's the love of my life, up to us to go on 
 And everything's burnin', buildings illuminated by the fire 
 And the city was lost, we tryna save it, the cross 
 The Star of David we lost 
 We started prayin' to governor, he a gangster 
 In cahoots with the mayor, the roof startin' to cave in 
 No, it's not a game, all is dark except the flame 
 Now nothin' will be the same 
 Now the whole world's changed 
 Music is soundin' different 
 Radio stations don't pump us up in their mix yet 
 Disco still gettin' that air time for big checks 
  
 Yo, somethin' gotta give 
 And somethin' gotta die so somethin' new can live[Intro] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail 
 The mic is contacted, I attract clientele 
 My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin' 
 Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin' 
 ‘Cause in my physical I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop 
 Place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille 
 It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a TEC with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose 
 Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This rhythmatic explosion 
 Is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again 
 Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot 
 Vocals will squeeze Glocks 
 MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep, I never fell 
 Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 It ain't hard to tell[Hook] 
 To the kids in the p.j.'s 
 Ghetto children I know it ain't easy 
 Ya'll wanting millions 
 Sunshine turns to rain 
 Its ghetto pain 
 When a one time raise 
 Sometimes the young is slain 
  
 To the kids in the p.j.'s black babies 
 Brought up in this world where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile 
 Future lifestyle looks hazey 
 Dreams to drive a Mercedes 
 With a pile of ladies 
  
 [NAS] 
 Third grade singing star spangled banner 
 Using proper manners 
 Learnt to handle anger animal behavior 
 Later on my block rocking with my jocks on 
 Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn 
 Humming a KISS rock song 
 Socks long to my knees 
 Summer breeze running through the leaves playing freeze tag 
 Can I stay out please dad 
 Can I hang out with my little gang out 
 Hearing shots rang out 
 Heard my moms call my name out 
 Come upstairs run up stairs 
 Take a bath shit stained underwear 
 Wipe yourself with paper bad 
 Little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate 
 Ate dinner up late 
 Gazing at the wall praying basketball 
 Was my future for this young one 
 Hooping in the sun 
 Proud to be where I come from 
 Later shooting guns fantasizing 
 Fascinated by gold rope chains 
 Looking back at my hood days 
 But things ain't changed 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Millenium Thug] 
  
 In my hood niggas smoke wood 
 Nothing is good 
 Look at my eys and see what I could 
 Living my life and feel what I felt 
 The hand that I was dealt 
 Drama that my uncle Shabazz had 
 I was a little lad 
 Niggas shooting through my Grams window shattering glass 
 Had the chicken pox 
 On that toy horse that rocks 
 My moms grabbed me down to safety 
 Everybody in the crib was going crazy 
 That was in the 80's 
 And now im 17 
 Money cash dreams 
 Niggas be slave 
 I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s 
 Close range niggas see brains 
 Millenium Thugs the name 
 But now it's slash cocaine 
 Blast niggas in vaine 
 Satch yo' chain 
 Cherrish the life 
 My niggas got a fetish for ice 
 Turn out the lights 
 I bust so I could spar up the night 
 Uniting the pipes 
 Queensbridge niggas is sheist 
 Need no price body yall dudes on spite 
 Who knew I would of spazzed out 
 Little Nayshawn owner of the crack house 
 Get my papes on 
 Tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone 
  
 [Wiz] 
 Now picture this shit 
 With six Aunts five Uncles 
 Thugging a double apartment out 
 Kids, cousins, and brothers 
 There I go in the pamper by the radiator 
 Cursing eatin first 
 Little nigga with a appetite that got worst 
 Firs day of school ten man cliq 
 All I'm learning is how to extort shit 
 'cuz class I forefit 
 Graduated on another level 
 Selling birds busting birds 
 Fuck with the herbs 
 Never we fuck up the herbs 
 Make 'em pay like you 
 Stick 'em up get down 
 Since ten was taught to turn 'em around 
 Rip they pockets out 
 Bust two the way they run 
 I ain't give a fuck that's how I was 
 I was young 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Horse] 
 Horse was born as a brave child 
 Big for my size 
 A bully to little guys 
 With chocolate miks and apple pies 
 The playground was mine 
 I stayed scarred up all the time 
 From shopping carts flipping 
 Now we race to the finish line 
 Hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit 
 Wasn't fun all the honey's say I'm it 
 Then they little ass run 
 I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones 
 That I caught 
 I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk 
 Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot 
 Squirrles and cats 
 Wanted to be Captain America with the 
 Shield and the hat I started getting older fell 
 More in love with the streets 
 Infactuated by the ropes and the shiny 
 Gold teeth I was to big to break dance 
 Fuck spiining on my back 
 My role models now run numbers and sell 
 Crack this project child blessed 
 Chasing ghetto success 
 He needs a name for himself 
 To ge the same respectClick, BOOM!, that's what I heard 
 Things crash 
  
 Listen up to what my soul conjures up 
 My tear ducts dry, can't cry, I conceal it, I die 
 My index finger and thumb push the pin to the drum 
 You ask where I've been, New York City, BX where I'm from 
 No figment of my imagination, sad situation for my dad 
 Killer came in my pad and started sprayin' 
 Father layin' on the floor, he breathin' no more 
 Shot to death, the reaper came like a thief through the door 
 Shaolin, he helps me, he wealthy in street knowledge 
 He deep in the path of drug dealin' and violence 
 Day in and day out, drama, we couldn't stay out 
 Livin' in my aunt's house, music the only way out 
 Cause we was in the broke down belly 
 Of a hungry beast 
 We stayed true, then we made up a crew 
 Shaolin gave me the name Book, I became a ragin' bull 
 Back when I was first enchanted by Grandmaster Flash 
 You had to be there, imagine him scratchin' wax 
 Up in his habitat in the Bronx, he got it on 
 The birth of a new group has spawned[Intro: Nas and AZ] 
 Aiyyo, wassup wassup let's keep it real son 
 Count this money, yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 Yea yea 
 Aiyyo, put the Grant's over there in the safe yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 Yea yea 
 Cause we spendin these Jackson's 
 The Washington's go to wifey, you know how that go 
 I'm sayin, that's what this is all about right? 
 Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 Yo then what man, what?? *echoes* 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Visualizin the realism of life in actuality 
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary 
 And my mentality is money-orientated 
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
 'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters 
 But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners 
 Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin 
 Others such as myself are tryin' to carry on tradition 
 Keepin this effervescent street ghetto essence inside us 
 Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
 Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go 
 But as long as we leavin thievin', we'll be leavin with some kind of dough 
 So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors 
 Me and my capers'll be somewhere stackin plenty papers 
 Keepin it real, packin' steel, gettin' high 
 Cause life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body now I'm fresh in 
 My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it 
 One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from 
 My skull causes pain in my brain vein money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain simple and plain 
 When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbin' foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards 
 Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash 
 And got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash 
 Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggas I used to run with 
 Is rich or doing years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto -- instead of saying fuck tomorrow 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric 
 Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 *Olu Dara plays trumpet until fade*So many niggas get fucked up in the game 
 See that's where they get caught out there in that word "Game" 
 Cause its not no fuckin game 
  
 When you hear shells coming at cha 
 Hot Ones from a shotgun I bet nigga runs faster 
 Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster 
 Think about that casket you don't wanna be in that shit 
 Quick to take his signin you taking every bodies package 
 Money over Bitches was a loyal practice 
 So you act as if money was no object 
 Spinin 5 zues trips for your whole projects 
 Epcot center linins for ya bitches, roli's for dogs 
 Now we in the mall slayin by his bitches 
 Everyday I reminiscing how he was living having fun 
 Cause any day could have led to prison 
 Not for a short bid cause if the feds ever caught kid 
 It be like 25 years conspiracy 
 Another 25 for rico snatching up him and his people 
 He had his jeep bullet proof with silencers on the desert eagle 
 Flipping bricks in Gary Indiana 
 He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer 
 Only trusted Two things his trigger and his hammer 
 Used to be a bum till had a six month run 
 Had a law suit three G's the case was won 
 Met with Mexican hoya cop boya 
 Bought barber shop named it after c shaday 
 There where they found his body 
 In a barber chair face down, bullets in his chest 
 Sliced apart from the waist down 
 Planned to sell his shop stick hoya for everything he got 
 Take jewels and his 5 
 Then his shoes where cemented 
 Drop his body in the tide but hoya was wise 
 Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes 
 Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive 
  
 Chorus (X2) 
  
 Always wanted things always wanted cash 
 To Live fast get the girls with tha biggest ass 
 Fuck her 9 to 5 gotta drive a 5 
 Now that I got it the Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive 
  
 Coke head Saundra she grew in Gruwana 
 Her man was large and Saundra was his baby mama 
 Stayed in drama Fighting with hood rats that he was fucking 
 No job all day she did nothing 
 They son was 7 years old, she really was a wifey 
 First should she would transport blow overnight for a G 
 He paid up front they laid up once 
 She got pregnant she would dead it 
 She had a boy, named her son infinite after his father who did dirt 
 She didn't noses after would follow 
 Capsules and bottles and crack in the back of his baga 
 He let her drive while he drove the burgandy 5 
 He often talked about how he wants to murder these guys 
 ]From off of burger street, had nat workin the street 
 Lifestyle richest nigga from how he use to be 
 Never thought he'd rock diamonds never took weakness for kindness 
 That's how he gradually grew 
 Did a Favor for a favor now the nigga in with the crew 
 And Now he live major house in dix hills next to Brook Shields 
 With the cook and the maid shit was real 
 Saved his first bill, maid, and his bodega 
 Good Luck playa sign on the paper taped to the window 
 Escaped from a would be kidnap 
 And slept and thought niggas fearless rep until he got wet 
 Would had the world in his hands his girl did a scam 
 The owners rich is boning niggas to get rid of her man 
 Welcome To The Game Baby 
  
 Chorus (X2) 
  
 The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive... 
 The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive... 
 The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...[Verse 1] 
 Man, Prince was a pimp, appolonia vanity 
 Sheila E. had me on the edge of insanity 
 Swore if I made it in music I'd be similar 
 Here I am, this is the future, I'm where the woman are 
 Rocking with Tim and Bob, y'all need me, shine a spotlight up 
 In the sky like Batman, I pops right up 
 This is Nas hate if u must hate been hot since the days of cassette tapes 
 T-shirts over the thermals dripped in our memories 
 Sipping that Hennessey .45th in my denim jeans 
 She told me she was my eyelashes 
 When we hump, I grunt just like a bull mastiff 
 They call me the best who ever did it 
 Only in the club one minute guess who I slip with 
 A chocolate dike ghetto thing sweet 
 We going to pop tonight, bon appetite 
  
 [Hook] 
 Do you know who I am? And she says 
 La lalala I already know 
 What we can't hold hands? And she says 
 La lalala I already know 
 You got to leave by three? you with me? 
 La lalala I already know 
 So until next week? you know, ma 
 La lalala I already know 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You know, mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who's the nastiest sexiest thug of them all? 
 I seen her in the mall, she was wearing home 
 Degarsole keyoke mose cherry cologne 
 She was looking very alone 
 'Til this big weightlifting Mr. Universe clone starts grabbing her own 
 But she can't stop looking im in the zone 
 One look at the kid she taking of her stone 
 Cash crazy ass crazy hair long 
 And baby amaze me because im in rare form 
 She like an ice cold bowl of post honeycomb 
 Followed me in the shop while I cop Nina Simone 
 Tap me on the shoulder I told her I her im on the phone 
 I played it off well nobody was on the cell 
 Shit, she said the tone? 
 She said mister so and so should I leave you alone? 
 I said 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Tick-tock, tick-tock time is passing 
 Hello? 
 Turn the television off, focus here 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You know, lover not a fighter 
 I'm the vagina liner reconstructor, bed sheet ruffler 
 For you freak girls undercover who loves ya? 
 I'm not a priest don't front for me, but step in my confessional 
 That's the bedroom, tell the truth I'll be impressional 
 Wait before you pass your collection plate 
 Show me you a professional so we straight? 
 She tried to kiss my lips, but no I don't do that 
 Want me to kiss my lips but not with a new jack 
 Few stacks spend my chips, yeah I do that 
 See the problem with you women is, look I got 'em 
 You can hear a mouse piss on cotton 
 You don't want to miss it then listen, stop stressing the man 
 We out to get as much sex as we can 
 And you roll wit the plan, shorty you lie 
 But you got to leave, 2:45 
  
 [Hook x2]Yo 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 Yo 
 The trains are New York Veins 
 The cities a cycle 
 People are the blood stream 
 Mean and ice cold 
 Laid back 
 Counter clockwise 
 The dice roll 
 Yank hats 
 Gang flags 
 Plane crash 
 Ground Zero 
 No lost angels 
 Ain't you from my from my man's and them area? 
 It's good to meet you 
 Ya man did 20 years for some FILA sneakers right 
 True 
 Had the 560 benz 
 Light blue 
 Where ed shot himself in the stomach 
 Smoke the dust 
 He let the culture culture bust 
 Back when we took the D train uptown 
 Shante and her whole crew 
 Groovy hair style 
 Yo baby yo baby yo t-shirts 
 Gold teeth smirks 
 At mark 125th 
 Hope the heat work 
 Few numbers I bagged 
 Then caught a cab back 
 To Jamaica Ave by the library 
 Seen the part of shabazz

 Skate Key 
 Empire USA 
 Rooftop 
 2 O'clock 
 Skates off break north 
 To the rink 
 Minks 
 Springfield in Newark 
 The 6 borough Jerz 
 Car jack city 
 The GW bridge 
 The Coop City 
 Popo's hot 
 Glocks in your Benzy box 
 Stash 
 And we move fast 
 Dropped off Miss Pretty 
 Shakes her ass to the building 
 Knowing I just killed it 
 Dudes in front of her door blocks her entrance 
 Asking her "who she been with?" 
 She laughs "mind ya business" 
 Tinted windows 
 Pop dutches with box cutters 
 Drop brothers off at comstock to see locked brothers 
 Hick town up in New York State 
 Jakes 
 Hate a black New York face 
 Jumping out the phantom with the Baps 
 Planet of the Apes 
 With the hammers on her waist 
 Gorillas in the tristate of 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 It dont matter if I been out of town 
 Cigar lounge 
 Doing rounds of tequila 
 Soon as I touch down 
 In NYC streets 
 The heat is on 
 The Talk 
 Who said what 
 I catch up on 
 The New Teflon Don 
 Who got they death bond 
 Who still stable 
 Where beef got squash at the round table 
 Who still holding it 
 Who hanging with snitches 
 Couple of Zulu's from back in the days who still up in clinton 
 No more hand shakes fake arm swing 
 See if your flinching 
 Need to hold something thats mention in every nigga sentence 
 When I get it you got it 
 D's went up in the project 
 Bail a couple of homies out 
 No doubt 
 Ferrari's in the summer 
 When its the hummer 
 Or the turtle top band satellite 
 Spilling drinks 
 Hitting potholes with savage types 
 Club 17 marque 
 The team flash 
 Next day hit the spas and the steam bath 
 Knock out this business 
 Do some promo 
 Make paper in the grind capital 
 Sign a graph then hit the hood 
 See the folks reminisce on how it was 
  
 In the most powerful city that i love NEW YORK[Intro] 
 Aiyyo whattup niggas? 
 Fresh off the honeymoon 
 The honeymoon's over 
 Fresh off vaca' (Yeah, yeah) 
 I'm jet-laggin', still jet-laggin' 
 But this just a preview 
 Let's get it on again y'all 
  
 [Verse] 
 I designed it, rhymed it, flow classic 
 You askin' who am signed with? 
 The real deal's Ill Will, stay scomit 
 Why's drama when other artists pay homage 
 You hatin any rapper I do a song with 
 "What's wrong with Nas helpin' crews get stronger" 
 You selfish, wantin' me to yourself 
 But prophets need help too, y'all see Nas get insulted 
 I ride for the real shit, High as the Lock's get melted 
 Twelve Years, givin' you nuttin' but big moments 
 How can Murda Inc not wanna fuck wit 
 The top hustler - R.O.C. crusha 
 Nas a legend 'fore BIG & Pac left us 
 Bubbled wit Dr. Drizze, you heard it on Makaveli 
 Sayin': "Nas is ring leader, brings Ether, brings heater" 
 Your dream teamer scream, "He's the Supreme Teacher" 
 Similar to anybody you know 
 Oh, I created, cremated, bodied that flow 
 Anyone you think is fuckin' wit me 
 Better be vets, better be Ra, better be Kool G, or KRS 
 Better be LL, or Slick or them 
 Neva put me in the Top Ten, bitch! 
 It's disrespect to the life that burnt the verses 
 Or nigga writes who comes first 
 It's the Ice Cube, MC Shan, them type dudes 
 So BET's list was wrong, don't get me wrong 
 I did chill in the throne alone so long 
 This is my My Will 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah, Escobaro Cigars, that's how we doin' it 
 Ayyo Quan, welcome to the game! 
 Shot-out to Ill Will (This is my my will) 
 Bravehearts stand up! Whuttup Scarface? 
 Whuttup Tre Williams? (This is my will) 
 Ill Will '05, what y'all know 'bout that? 
 Queens, Queens I know you miss me 
 I gotchu, I gotchu Queens, New York stand up! 
 Aha, I gotchu baby, let's do it again!"Ladies and gentleman 
 In this corner 
 The champion of champions 
 From Catskill, New York 
 Iron Mike Tyson" 
  
 And in the other corner 
 The lyrical champion 
 Hailing from Queensbridge, New York 
 Is the one and only 
 Nas 
  
 And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME! 
  
 Verse 1: 
 Spirit of the streets 
 Walks in the ring 
 From Brownsville to spar fit 
 To boxing king 
 Man or machine, an animal 
 Physical strength and intelligence 
 But that type of intellect 
 Y'all respect 
 To connect those punches 
 Still as a kid he stole lunches 
 To mak'in millions and the hundreds 
 Chaotic conscience 
 The rage, the stage, the grander 
 Had to endorse slander 
 Took it like a man 
 Cause the mighty stand alone 
 In the bigger ring hole 
 The penitentiary 
 Barbed wire and stone was amp up 
 They locked a champ up 
 Even my brains in handcuff 
 The robin hood, seasonal santa 
 And y'all give him nothin to begin with 
 Dilapidated buildings 
 The drug epidemics 
 Historical stories 
 Pain, love and glory 
 Mike Tyson 
 Never see another like him

 Verse 2: 
 True legend 
 His hands was two weapons 
 Understand this minds a true blessing 
 Designer jewels and diamond 
 A modern day Jack Johnson 
 Flying private jets and fully protect'in 
 Automized with ladies Godiva complexions 
 Lots of sex'in 
 Hung with a lot of stars 
 Learned a lot of lessons 
 Between dead homies and best friends 
 And getting domed out in stretch Benz 
 Educated from the hood and pestilence 
 The dead presidents don't see your pockets 
 You just gett'in 
 You got a full court press for them 
 Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men 
  
 It's a warriors world 
 Only the strong survive 
 Who's next to try 
 Who's next to be the next 
 T-Y-S-O-N 
 He gave us hope 
 May the best man win

 Visualizing the realism of life in actuality 
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary 
 And my mentality is money-orientated 
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
 Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters 
 But somethin' musta got in us cause all of us turned to sinners 
 Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin 
 Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition 
 Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us 
 Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
 Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go 
 But as long as we leaving thievin' 
 We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so 
 Until that day we expire and turn to vapors 
 Me and my capers, will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers 
 Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high 
 Cause life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Hook: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
 That's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
 That's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go

 [Bridge 2: ?] 
 You gotta get the ground beneath your feet partner 
 Get the wind behind your back 
 Ride the blades of Glory if you got to 
 Otherwise you ain't shit 
 You might as well be (?) your damn self 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and 
 My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it 
 One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from 
 My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain 
 When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbin foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards 
 Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and 
 Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash 
 Now I think about cash in abundance 
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow" 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Times is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric 
 I Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

 [Outro: Arsenal] 
 Yea, you know the flavor, Nas and AZ on the remix joint 
 This is another explosion from the Arsenal 
 Yes, man[Intro:] 
 I-i-i-i-t-i-it ain't hard to tell 
 Nas, Nas, Nas is the king of discoing 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail 
 The mic is contacted, I attract clientele 
 My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining 
 Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing 
 Cause in my physical, I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Nas, Nas, Nas is the king of discoing 
 Nas, Nas, Nas is the king of discoing 
 Nas, Nas, Nas is the king of discoing 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell 
 I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a Tec with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose 
 Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again 
 Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks 
 MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep, I never fail 
 Nas's raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:]Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong wars! Killing each other is definitely played out. Being hurt from the lost of a love one was never cool. 
  
 Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong war! I know that feeling, that frustration with life and needing to take it out on someone, any one. But.... 
  
 We chose the dumbest things to go the hardest for. I remember seeing deaths over 8 ball jackets, Fila sneakers, and name plate chains. Deaths over "he say, she say"!!!!! "I'm from this block or I'm from that block", or "my moms n pops is f*cked up now the whole world gotta pay"!!! 
  
 I remember feeling like I was the hardest "n*gga" breathing. And I couldn't wait to prove it. But let's think. What are we really proving?? And proving what to who?? Everybody knows Chicago breeds the strongest of the strong but I just feel, me, being ya brother from another state feels your pain as if I grew up with you in ya very own household. 
  
 You have the ability and mindpower to change they way we are looked at. Look who's watching us young warriors, look who's throwing us in jail constantly, look at the ignorance in the world. Look at the racist dogs who love to see us down. Loving to bury us in the ground or in jail where we continue this worthless war on one another. 
  
 Young warriors.... We are WASTING more and more time. We gotta get on our jobs and take over the world. Cuz this movie left the theaters years ago, Juice, Menace, Boyz n the Hood , Blood n Blood Out, Belly! 
  
 When we see each other why do we see hatred? Why were we born in a storm, born soldiers, WARRIORS....and instead of building each other up we are at war with each other.. May the soul of this young person find peace with the almighty. I'm with you young warriors. You're me and I'm you. But trust me! you are fighting the wrong war.

 There's a man who live the life of danger 
 To everyone he meets stays as stranger

 Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

 Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan 
 Secret agent man advance his game

 [Verse 1 - Nas] 
 Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice 
 Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us 
 U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time 
 Whether you innocent or did the crime 
 Say you come from who this cops pursue you hard 
 Run your plates, put guns in your face 
 Put you in the car, for nothing 
 Now your strugglin', tied up, standing in line-ups 
 Call your lawyer, they charged you with murder 
 Why? Cuz these liars said you shot another man on his driveway 
 Guilty, just for being black on a Friday 
 Polygraph test you failing, because you're nervous 
 Charged for murder you didn't commit, then they serve ya 
 Fifteen years, maximum security 
 Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone injuries 
 You were placed there intentionally 
 Either you bang or you miss me, listen to me 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Im grippin' the Nina, visions of 9/11 
 Visions of three sixes, no sevens 
 This is Bushonomics, George is a modern day Ronald Reagan 
 I pray to god in the midst of Pagans 
 Niggers I'm just saying 
 When do we stop playing? 
 When do we stop pimping and start spraying? 
 50 shots for every cop that popped Sean Bell his body lay'in 
 But they acquit cuz they know 
 That our generation won't do shit! Nothing, nada 
 But every rapper is a shotta or a Don Dada 
 Or a killer, but you ain't killing nothing 
 And it's peace unless it's another nigga 
 Tryna raise boys to Superman 
 And while I'm at it fuck Arthur J. Cooperman 
 It's never justice for blacks but they send just us to Iraq 
 With poor whites and Latinos 
 I pray to God that you hear this single 
 This is Banner's middle finger y'all 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 You still want to be nigga too? 
 (*Gunshot sound)[Hook - Keyshia Cole] 
 I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's 
 More than I can say 
 It would take a whole lifetime to tell you 
 More than I can say 
 Every time I wrote a line it’s still 
 More than I can say 
 This is the realest shit I ever wrote 
 More than I can say 
  
 [Verse 1 - Nas] 
 Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure 
 The sickness: dreaming of riches 
 Reality was the cure. My doctor 
 Physician was music, I'm sure 
 The prescription was super-model sandwiches 
 And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror 
 Fixing up my hat right 
 DMV don't make licenses for the fast life 
 Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right 
 And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights 
 I just want the whole world to bop their heads 
 Someone to stop my bread 
 If my pops was here, he'd be like "son, you the one 
 They gotta crown you, a gift from around you 
 Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle? 
 If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over 
 Just stay on point, do what you do 
 Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder.. 
  
 [Hook - Keyshia Cole] 
  
 [Verse 2 - Nas] 
 Keep having the same dream 
 About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all 
 In the middle of flames 
 An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain 
 Hear a voice that asks what do I claim? 
 I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance 
 As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands 
 I could do what I wish with it, and waking up 
 To study my dreambook, see if it links up 
 Looking for some significance, like does the dream 
 Represent this cold world I'm living in? 
 Ask my man, then his laughter begin 
 He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun 
 Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic 
 The cross, I had it all my life, the same height 
 I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out 
 Time out: my body won't wind down[Intro: Nas (Redhead Kingpin)] 
 Aiyyo check it out y'all this is Nas, y'all know what I do to the business 
 (Yeah! Uh!!!) I bring back the business (Nas you my dude for this B) 
 Awww man y'all ain't ready (Straight check it) 
 Here they are the remix, let's go 
  
 [Verse 1: Redhead Kingpin] 
 It's Kingpin plus two I'm on the guestlist fam 
 But if this dude ain't like thirty he don't know who I am 
 Boo boo my name, monetary gain is better than fame 
 But let's face it without the spotlight you thinkin Red is Eddie Kane 
 If I was drugs then I used to be a key 
 Now I'm a couple ounce, on the come up hustle me 
 Yeah, and hip hop man ain't no 401K 
 I got my MPC I'll see you one day 
  
 [Verse 2: Rob Base]

 Still rippin shows, Rob Base let me get ill yo! 
 It's the O.G., (who?) R to the O-B

 If you don't it's the one that hit you with the WHOO YEAH 
 Used to make it so hot, you couldn't breathe the air 
  
 [Verse 3: The Original Spinderella]

 Hard body, fuckin wit a Coke bottle model 
 Auburn, full back and observe 
 While I BLAP BLAP to your nerves, uh! (OH!)

 Anything y'all will do, Spin dunn done it

 On the turntables, call me Gillette 
  
 [Verse 4: Father MC] 
 Yo! First of all big up to Nas the killer rip spitter 
 The Q.B. hitter called this Far Rock nigga 
 Yeah I'm drippin heavy from my head to my feet 
 From the bars that I spit to my name on her cheeks 
 Catch me on the mixtape, Bentley with the Queen draped 
 Pilot on deck G5 when I gotta skate 
 Let you know when I'm out on the dough that shows I'm sellin them 
 My LP's drugs nigga be like runnin listen

 Is she out for the count UK mic deceased? 
 You never heard again from words not the least 
 I checked first set net worth mic relief 
 Remain calm more vowels spit battles 
 And associate the kid when they hustlin up the cattle

 Hip Hop crowd well in doubt where are you now?

 To play bad mitten at the top of your position 
 Wit a whole lotta niggas wouldn't play but it's written

 Nicholas one son the (Greatest Man) livin 
 True school be like e'ryday thanksgiving

 Squeeze ya dick up in ya in the ear as if ya for me

 [Verse 9: Krazy Drazy from Das EFX] 
 Miggity [microphone check], "Where Are they Now" Nas remix 
 Feel how real Hip Hop needs this 
 Wish B.I.G, Pun, and Pac could see this 
 Diggity Das-EFX piggity pioneers in this 
 Made his kids just reminded y'all 
 Throwback go back to the nineties y'all 
 Look it up, hook it up, get the catalog 
 We your favorite rappers, rappers, rappin dog 
  
 [Verse 10: Mr. Do It All from Lords Of The Underground] 
 Yeah I go Nas, Lord Do It All 
 Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl 
 Burst in the bricks, talked to buyin ?leather? 
 Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered 
 I do this with a passion, spray-paint tag in 
 Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon 
 On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin 
 It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin! 
  
 [Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens] 
 Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move 
 And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof 
 Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it 
 With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!! 
 When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you 
 I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room! 
 Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar 
 Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo! 
  
 [Verse 12: Dres from Black Sheep] 
 For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin 
 For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla

 Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation 
 But I not try and snitch upon my ?inclamation? 
 On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation 
 And my mind has been kenotic, kill the pres led a netion, Dres 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles 
 This your man Nas, here they are 
 Unbelievable, Hip Hop is Dead 
 Let's see what happens aight!!![Pop] (Intro) 
 Uhh, still out in these motherfuckin projects 
 Still a nigga ain't never gonna get the fuck up outta here 
 Niggas just don't understand the story 
  
 Chorus: [Pop] 
 Niggas die for the street glory 
 Go to trial get tried for each story 
 And each nigga got a story 
 And QB the streets call me 
 So if you see me slippin' reach for me 
 I'm goin' after street glory 
 Go to trial get tried for each story 
 And each nigga got a story 
 And QB the streets call me 
 So if you see me slippin' reach for me 
 I'm goin' after street glory 
  
 [NAS] 
 Yo 
 Every time I turn around niggas shot, niggas stabbed 
 When tonight's pregnant girls struggling to get a cab 
 Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets 
 Kids put to bed duck they heads from gats poppin' 
 Queensbridge slingers hoppin' out Benzes 
 Don status, dope fiends got syringes 
 Poppin' out their arm scratching 
 I remember park jams 
 Gazelles, perfect wave, shell Adidas 
 Smellin' reefer way before purple haze 
 Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare 
 Hats tilted wild niggas lickin' shots in the air 
 Me and Pop was there, through the years our names have switched 
 Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz 
 What project is this? QB, Vernon and 10th 
 12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat 
 What could you tell me? Nigga's seen it all in this game 
 When it's all said and done just remember my name 
  
 [Pop] 
 I'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime 
 Embryo of the ghetto born face and time 
 Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine 
 Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined 
 How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted? 
 Where corruptors and new police being recruited 
 Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded 
 While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed 
 Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly 
 That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street 
 Through all the pap grease and street chases 
 Sudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases 
 I blew smoke through hallway window 
 Watched the buddah clouds linger 
 Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers 
 My eyes flip different shades 
 Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways 
 Seein' nothing but another day 
 In this six story rat trap 
 Them gats clap another nigga's blazed 
 Events in my hood rotate 
 Like the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love 
 Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs 
 Coming at you kisses and hugs 
 When death calls who's really a thug 
 The street glory got me deeply in love 
 Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it 
 Got me needin' this drug 
  
 (Chorus)[Talking: Nas] 
 The wild Gremlins 
 Ya'll know the F. right? 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 When the winner lose... and the losers win 
 Nobody scores just a few good men 
 But everybody sins 
 A lot of young die 
 Fall in the trap, strung high 
 Try to go legal, but the hood calling you back 
 Flipping the crack, cause I miss it for example 
 Watching base-heads wildin' on my first sample 
 I elevated up, since snakes in my circumference 
 Now I hit my niggas with cakes and say, "Pump This" 
 Thank god for cracks, corners, and marijuana 
 Hoodrats and good gats to carry on ya 
 I got dead friends, misled friends, crackhead friends 
 Wild Gremlins, who "bust led" friends 
 Silent weapons for quiet wars 
 Or loud gats 
 Tussle too long, some shiny moves the crowd back 
 It's powerful, niggas would die over respect 
 And money is secondary to that whole aspect 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 I Love it, when I'm... High 
 I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh 
 I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh 
 Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects 
 And clap at sets, a nigga... High 
 North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh 
 I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh 
 I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS! 
  
 [Nas:] 
 Niggas rushing to the top, not knowing what it takes to be... 
 King Of The Industry, the wise move patiently 
 Ya niggas is hating me, won't be happy till I'm back witcha... 
 Selling crack witcha, half & half on a pack witcha 
 My pen and pad, paint a black picture... 
 Of young goons passing liquor, after-hour store mass of niggas 
 Street corner combos, staggering winos... 
 Tahoes coming through, blasting songs I know 
 Niggas scheme, girls pregnant by sixteen 
 Clique out to get rich... 
 Empty clips for cream 
 Same funeral home, for different stiff bodies 
 Once a month a new family goes there, it don't surprise me 
 Cried 'til the tears, dried up inside me 
 Revenge to the end, laws in NYC 
 Got up by the way I used to be... 
 Apartment 5D... where dope fiends in the hall try your knob when you sleep 
 Surveillance Cameras in my house now, watching you creep 
 Spot you from deep, guns for all possible beef 
 Niggas try to rock you asleep 
 Kidnap your whole fam for a week 
 Asking for ransom, niggas starving, dying to eat 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 I Love it, when I'm... High 
 I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh 
 Yo... I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh 
 Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects 
 And clap at sets, a nigga... High 
 North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh 
 I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh 
 I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS![Produced by 9th Wonder] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
 (What's up niggas, ayo, I know you ain't talking 'bout me, dog, you? what?) 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
 (You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga) 
 Fuck Jay Z! 
  
 [Hook] 
 (I) Fuck with your soul like ether 
 (Will) Teach you – the king – you know you 
 (Not) God's Son across the belly 
 (Lose) I prove you lost already 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waiting 
 It's like an AIDS test – what's the result? Not positive 
 Who's the best? Pac, Nas and B.I.G 
 Ain't no best – East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy 
 I embrace y'all with napalm, blowed up, no guts left, chest/face gone 
 How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage 
 Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne 
 I got this locked since 9-1 
 I am the truest; name a rapper that I ain't influenced 
 Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas 
 With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten 
 Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave 
 Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face 
 Y'all some well wishers, friendly acting, envy hiding snakes 
 With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take 
 When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep 
 That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef 
 Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo 
 To explode it on a camel and his soldiers 
 I can handle this for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid 
 When KRS already made an album called Blueprint 
 First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say 
 That you better than B.I.G, dick-sucking lips 
 Why don't you let the late, great veteran live 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I... will... not... lose 
 God's son across the belly, I prove you lost already 
 The king is back, where my crown at 
 Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches, what's sad is I love you 
 Cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches 
 My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous 
 And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin' his only son that made it 
 You seem to be only concerned with dissing women 
 Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly 
 Well life is harsh; hug me, don't reject me 
 Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly 
 In '88 you was getting chased through your building 
 Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers 
 All I did was gave you a style for you to run with 
 Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the God 
 Wearing Jaz chains, no Tecs, no cash, no cars 
 No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case 
 Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase 
 You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan 
 I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class 
 You Tae-bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic 
 Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge 
 Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though 
 That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow 
 Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy? 
 Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy 
 Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter 
 And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after? 
 Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas 
 And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas 
 Feel these hot rocks fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas 
 In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas 
 Foxy got you hot, cause you kept your face in her puss 
 What you think, you getting girls now cause of your looks 
 Ne-gro please, you no mustache having 
 With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you wack 
 And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame 
 You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G 
 And Eminem murdered you on your own shit 
 You a dick-riding faggot, you love the attention 
 Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha 
  
 [Outro] 
 R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick 
 J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick 
 Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick 
 Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick 
 So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick 
 How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips 
 Wanted to be on every last one of my classics 
 You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss[Intro: Marsha Amborious (Nas)] 
 Oooh oooh, oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh! The struggles of life! (Life!) 
 Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted) 
 Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Before I use to dream I could rule the world 
 Now it's thorough I survived the perils in my fly apparel 
 Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels 
 I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills 
 The president here, he's honest and fair 
 Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared 
 January 20th I was there 
 I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care 
 Recession is a blessin in disguise 
 For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die 
 I'm still sippin' Rose' PJ's it be's like that 
 I brung the eighty seven Fila's back 
 Save collect, B.I.G.'S dream came correct 
 Tryin' to push seven hundreds, they made them yes 
 I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah) 
 The ghetto advocate for education look what I become 
  
 [Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}] 
 Before I use to dream I ruled the world 
 {I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it} 
 So here I am, to rule the world, world 
 But now you used to dream you ruled the world 
 (Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!) 
 {I use to dream} (Ruled the world) 
 So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I don't say I'm maintainin', that's a lame's language (word) 
 Poor English, from a wise man I learned patience 
 Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge 
 I don't say I'm grindin', cause everything I do is redefining 
 Cause when you know the streets to the science 
 Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit 
 Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, "Will I win? " 
 The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense 
 Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress 
 Be responsive, to these inner-city problems 
 Behind a tent with a chauffeur, I rep for the culture 
 Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah 
 I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for 
 A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa 
 I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo 
 Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle 
 Yep! 
  
 [Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}] 
 Before I use to dream I ruled the world 
 {I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it} 
 So here I am, to rule the world, world 
 But now you used to dream you ruled the world 
 (Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!) 
 {I use to dream} (I Ruled the world) 
 So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!) 
  
 [Bridge: Marsha Ambrosious (Nas)] 
 You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!) 
 Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!) 
 Use your mind - make a change 
 Yes, we can - see a brighter day 
 Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain 
 But no excuses to be made 
 This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor! 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong 
 There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on 
 I can't count the amount I drew heaters on 
 Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam 
 Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform 
 The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from 
 Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from 
 I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah 
  
 [Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}] 
 Before I use to dream I ruled the world 
 {I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it} 
 So here I am, to rule the world, world 
 But now you used to dream you ruled the world 
 (Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!) 
 {I use to dream} (I Ruled the world) 
 So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!) 
 Before I use to dream I ruled the world 
 {I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it} 
 So here I am, to rule the world, world 
 But now you used to dream you ruled the world 
 (Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!) 
 {I use to dream} (Oh we come so far!) 
 So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)[Intro] 
 (AZ) Ayo what's up what's up let's keep it real son 
 Count this money, you know what I'm sayin' 
 (Nas) Yeah yeah 
 (AZ) Ayo put the Grants over there in the safe you know what I'm sayin' 
 Cause we spendin' these Jacksons 
 The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go 
 (Nas) I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right 
 Clothes, bankrolls and hoes you know what I'm sayin' 
 Yo then what man, what 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Visualizing the realism of life and actuality 
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary 
 And my mentality is money-orientated 
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
 Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters 
 But something must have got in us cause all of us turned to sinners 
 Now some resting in peace and some are sitting in San Quentin 
 Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition 
 Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us 
 Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
 Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go 
 But as long as we leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough, so 
 Until that day we expire and turn to vapors 
 Me and my capers, will be somewhere else stackin' plenty papers 
 Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high 
 Cause life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Hook: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
 That's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
 That's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and 
 My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it 
 One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from 
 My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain 
 When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards 
 Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and 
 Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash 
 Now it's all about cash in abundance 
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow" 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric 
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1: Foxy Brown] 
 Check it, uhh 
 Protect this, nigga, for the necklace, I throw the death wish 
 The pretty slim sex shit to rep this 
 Remember Fox said this, we on some next shit 
 We are blessed this, the scars on our back mean we meant this 
 To lie for 'em, the 25-sentence to keep my eyes on 'em 
 I'm straight, knowin' Allah'll shine on 'em 
 Shitty drugs and drama, opposite 3 pretty thugs and a don mama 
 Fill in the rest, the steel in they chest 
 When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over and we laid out 
 Chill, I was open off the way he ate out 
 It was real, for real, I was fuckin' with mills and he was frag-ile 
 You wildin', the Brown Stallion stay stylin' 
 On the low foulin', the whole Firm wildin' 
 We lucked it, I know the trick bitch he fuck with 
 On some duct shit, heard through the grape that she suck dick 
 Firm, Sos and Esco, mad loco, Fox and 'Mega for whatever 
 And through this cheddar, we gon' stay family 'til we fry, though 
 The fam will never split even if one of us got old 
 Along with our Kikos, we gon' blaze 'til the brick goes 
 Peep the Na-Na, sweet taboo, The Firm tattooed on the ta-ta 
 Now, tell me what crew will hold it down like we do, Da-Da? 
  
 [Verse 2: AZ] 
 'Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless 
 Ice necklace, high-priced dressed executives 
 Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina 
 .44 nickel-plate long with the silencer 
 Play for keeps, any shut-eye, you stay sleep 
 Shit remain deep, get shells thrown at ya Range Jeep 
 Giuliani sweep got all the kings goin' up creek 
 Devil life biz, now, who left controllin' the streets? 
 No intelligence, strictly slow niggas mind's are negligent 
 It's evident, Feds vest-up, raid ya residence 
 We're all for livin', heavyweight Firm division 
 Mind detect mind, eatin' swine's against my religion 
 You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze 
 It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates 
 Next up? (Yo, I believe that's me) 
 Aiyo 'Mega, represent for the family 
  
 [Verse 3: Cormega] 
 Aiyo, the Feds got me in the top ten 
 'Cause when my door got knocked in, my .44 main cocked spit 
 My sinister mind shines like a Dillinger 
 'Mega exhausted, baby-faced crime emperor 
 Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds 
 And peep the way drugs feed a thug nigga's seeds 
 I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up 
 Coke prices rise when drug supplies dry-up 
 The Millennium drives up, rims semi blind ya eyes temporarily 
 Mind of 'Mega be heavily armed for felonies 
 Shine you could never see, the next phat cat out of NYC 
 It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics 
 Livin' since my real niggas bailed me out of prison 
 A lot of schemes 'cause the narcotics team in Queens 
 Have more dollars then the knowledge of fiends 
 My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury 
 Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me 
  
 [Verse 4: Nas] 
 To all thoroughbreds takin' the corners, y'all need to join us 
 Firm, most powerful nation of rap performers 
 High-class generals, confidants, payin' lawyers 
 Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, Green Beret warriors 
 Fakes, I peep 'em like the J. Kennedy tape 
 In the nude with Jude, bustin' all in her face 
 In other words, yo, you see-through 
 My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth 
 We all eat 'cause I speak truth 
 Uneducated black youth, street diploma 
 Teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stolen 
 It's a Firm thing, generally gleam 
 I wrote the theme on how to sell a million 
 While you crabs is mad at ya promotion team 
 I roll with the nicest, Fox, black Isis pushin' Benz without a license 
 Gear tight as vice-grips 
 Nas got 19 wifies, 7 sheisty, 9 of 'em Pisces 
 3 white meats under Tai Chi 
 Wildin', big links is heavy like bricks 
 That you throw on a pit-bull neck while feedin' him raw steak 
 It's core take, more cake, I take the crown 
 Off the so-called king of the town and lock it down 
  
 [Outro: Jungle] 
 Yeah, dun, that's it, dun, y'all niggas rip that shit, yo, word is bond 
 That's that real shit for all y'all fake motherfuckers out there, yo 
 That's how we do it from Queensbridge, nigga, The Firm, what! 
 This is Jungle, yo, big Jungle, boy, what!? Y'all niggas don't want it 
 Yo, Style, if these niggas don't know right now, yo 
 Fuck all them niggas then"It's much more than a march 
 It will be the beginning of a movement 
 Millions more movement; let us begin" 
  
 "Tell us what you hear" 
  
 [Nas] 
 Dear people of the globe 
 I hope that you're in good health 
 By the time my voice hit you 
 I hope it all is well with you 
 My mission is to bail with you 
 Touch upon some real issues 
 Senators, Government Officials 
 Sit at the conference and listen 
 Have a Coke or mineral water and say I'm reminiscing 
 George L. Jackson, Malcolm X last wind when I'm rapping 
 Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men 
 Send your clergymen to journey with Nas from Queens, projects 
 I promise an unforgettable experience 
 Compare me with, Amenhotep get in more debt 
 History was stolen, get in my zone 
 What makes the powers that be, less gangsta then Al Capone? 
 The Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was 
 Think I'm a thug?, let's talk about some conquerors 
 Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan 
 Hitler, Edi Amin, Attila the Hun 
 Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun 
 From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon 
 I'm sitting on Capitol Hill 
 I'm composing this rhyme, guaranteed to make all of y'all feel 
 The beauty that was trapped under siege 
 Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me

 "We will not surrender or we will not back down, we keep overacting"

 We march for education"

 [Nas] 
 The rejection of what's right could mean you in denial 
 It either breaks you or makes you becomes hostile 
 I swallow many lies before tasting the truth 
 In the beginning there was darkness, beautiful you 
 How will life be without night?, no tranquility? 
 No way to get away and rest, no stability? 
 I can't see the sky without the moon and the stars 
 The sunlight blocking everything, the king I'm in raw 
 People worship the Madonna in the shrines in Spain's 
 I'm proud to share the same blood type in veins 
 The holy mother -- the loneliest color remains 
 Can't be tampering, diluted the chains 
 They try make you not want it, make you run from it 
 The wickedest men, want the ebony punished 
 It's so seductive, it's sensuous in my clutches 
 Hot as fire when Moses saw burning bushes 
 So abused and misused and mistreated 
 Naked men wanna get drunk and get weed it 
 People wild when she comes out pull out and party 
 Catch her body, fornicate some start beef 
 Chain reaction cause it's in the air 
 The lost tribe scattered everywhere 
 From the North thru West Hemisphere 
 Scientist and Archaeologist conceal the obvious 
 The dead, living and little children over time of this 
 Obsession, caressing, every essence of magnetism 
 Every organism when it come to it 
 All question about Resurrection and your connection with God 
 It's answered with the beast in your heart

 UK hot with it, blew spots with it 
 Every continent love when I spit it 
 Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it 
 Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it 
 It's real in the field the Last Mohican 
 Who survived in the streets and did something decent 
 Now I got plans to buy the whole hood 
 Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge

 Nas, and Nasty's the alias 
 Everything platinum I glow 
 Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do' 
 On top out the car, lounge at the bar 
 We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are 
 Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler 
 To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas 
 Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers 
 Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper 
 Look good enough to be taken shoppin' 
 Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking 
 Your body's so nice that I give you this option 
 Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping 
 [Repeat 1] 
 [Repeat 2] 
 [Ginuwine] 
 I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me) 
 I think you owe me some (You owe me) 
 The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas) 
 I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine) 
 (You owe Timbaland, you owe me) 
 [Nas] 
 Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me 
 Mack like Goldie, it's the same story 
 Let you hold something, you spending it right 
 Know where you gon' be by the end of the night 
 Make it bounce, shake it, move it around 
 Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south 
 Fantasizing me inside and you riding 
 Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion 
 [Ginuwine] 
 Shorty, say what's your price 
 Just to back it up

 When I walk through everything stops, silence 
 Remain quiet, babies don't cry thugs don't buss 
 Cops cut off sirens, oxygen freeze 
 Noises to a minimun nigga, I pop and I squeeze 
 I represent the pain and struggle 
 Cut out your eyeballs then brain-fuck you 
 Yo you testin with death 
 I'm confronting the justice, expressing my voice to the public 
 They got to free some brothas or we kidnap the judges 
 They got to free some sistas or we kidnap the judges 
 They got to beat the system that's enslaving the poor 
 Our practicing, gun rages, they R's and .44's 
 Many fought teams and for green this is war 
 This is life and I'm the hardest, got ya label all scared 
 Callin up the radio, don't want my records to air

 I'm the leader, that's it, nobody higher 
 Nobody touchin' my crown, nobody dyin' 
 Nobody smoother, harder, tougher, believe it 
 I'm much more smarter, much more strategic 
 Scholarships and hollow tips, a lot of walkin' caskets 
 They talk a good one but there's never no action 
 And I'm the type to poison ya sista, twist her 
 Through wit' her put the gun in your face and make you hit her 
 Make you quiver -when they silhouette of a Don, Benson 
 Light up a Cu-ban, recite a few psalms 
 Enlighten you quick, teach you how a king wins wars 
 Keep your ears to the street, love your enemies more 
 'Cuz hate can frustrate, and confuse 
 Too eager you lose, patience, plan your attack then you move - ghetto 
 Green Berets, got freaks got hoes 
 Who be jumpin' out of movin' cars and land at my feet - because

 Ya'll niggas see it, it's all in the streets 
 Ya man know it, ya girl know it

 Get high, get ya drink on, relax 
 Why? Cause I'm the motherfuckin' general[Produced by Godfather Don & V.I.C.] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid 
 When the cops came, you should've slid to my crib 
 Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done 
 Plus congratulations, you know, you got a son 
 I heard he looks like ya, why don't ya lady write ya? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flippin', talkin' 'bout he acts too rough 
 He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff 
 I was like, yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too 
 Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach 
 It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime 
 Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines 
 And night time is more trife than ever 
 What up with Cormega? Did you see him, are y'all together? 
 If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest 
 Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? One Love 
  
 [Hook: Sadat X] 
 One L, to the O-V-E 
 Representin' kids on lockdown from stress on the street 
 One L, to the O-V-E 
 It's all real, watch the feds, son, duck that shield 
 One L, to the O-V-E 
 Representin' kids on lockdown from stress on the street 
 One L, to the O-V-E 
 It's all real, I got to hustle, son, my kid need a meal 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on 
 The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin' 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin' 
 That nigga you shot last year tried to appear 
 Like he hurtin' somethin', word to mother, I heard him frontin' 
 And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock 
 And now they run together, what up, son, whatever 
 Since I'm on the streets, I'mma put it to a cease 
 But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece 
 Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira 
 Better chill 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers 
 But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours 
 On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal 
 When we start the revolution, all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next V-I 
 I gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks 
 Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low key 
 So stay civilized, time flies 
 Though incarcerated your mind dies 
 I hate it when your moms cries 
 It kinda makes me want to murder, for realer 
 I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but One Love 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world 
 Thinkin' how can we exist through the facts 
 Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad 
 For the weekend, hittin L's while I'm sleepin' 
 A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home 
 You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible 
 Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue 
 Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop 
 Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops 
 He said "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof 
 So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce" 
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black 
 We was chillin' on these benches 
 Where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard keeps me blasted And starts talkin' mad shit 
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him 
 'Cause when the pistol blows 
 The one that's murdered be the cool one 
 Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up 
 Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed 
 Never bust up at the crowd, catch him solo 
 Make the right man bleed 
 Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only twelve, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes 
 Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man I'mma ghost, I broze 
 Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, One Love 
  
 [Hook]May laughter 
 For backstabbers 
 Turn to tears faster 
 For you I wish no snakes would slither past ya 
 Ya have ta 
 Keep your vision clear 
 Only a coward lives in fear 
 My surroundings, got only real powerful niggas here 
 Real friends we have a code of ethics 
 No question 
 No feminine tendencies 
 We not expecting 
 No gossip 
 No phony logic 
 No counting your homey pocket 
 Spare no expense 
 For legal defense 
 If your homey locked up 
 Who cares who was the last who looked out? 
 Selfishness 
 That's a character flaw 
 No holding out 
 Yo what happened to the honor? 
 You're dealing with 
 Sensitive prima donna drama 
 Teflon love 
 For my dudes who solid[Nas] 
 Don't hurt nuttin.. 
  
 [Hook] 
 A teenage thug (you can't tell them shit) 
 A teenage thug (nigga just chasin his dick) 
 A teenage thug (he want the world to recognize) 
 A teenage thug (he's a man now, fuck his size) 
 A teenage thug (can't stop him, they on the rise) 
 A teenage thug (the court of law despise) 
 A teenage thug (wanna fuck and puff lie) 
 A teenage thug 
  
 [Nas] 
 Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate 
 Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate 
 Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face 
 Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out 
 Lost respect for those cracked out 
 Most of my elders were failures 
 To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic 
 The later I would hang, the greater my slang 
 It took my english, replaced it with game 
 Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets 
 Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it 
 Dared to do what I would 
 First blunt they passed me tasted nasty 
 Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me 
 Eyes red, pants saggin 
 My first dime cut me off for braggin 
 That we was home alone tappin 
 Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker 
 Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya 
  
 [Nas] 
 Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit 
 Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit 
 Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut 
 My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss 
 Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers 
 Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York 
 Talk to this hottie with my niggas who quick to blast you 
 If you old cats, to these niggas, they harass you 
  
 [Millenium Thug] 
 Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans 
 Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man 
 Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time 
 A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes 
 Only twelve in this hell where kids die 
 I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly 
 My Range shift by, I peel the road up 
 With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest 
 Wild as a teenage thug 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Millenium Thug] 
 Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggas 
 And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that 
 Yo where your mack at? I got mine 
 Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine 
 Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin 
 Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips 
 Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with 
 Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen 
 Under my glove shit rocky 
 Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi 
 A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine 
 No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin 
 Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people 
 I chill up in the regal Eagle 
 And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy 
 I rip nappy, nature's to cut the roof off of Caddies 
 You see me?

 For all the brothers uptown 
 Keep that one love 
 For all the brothers in jail 
 Keep that one love

 One Love, One Love 
 One love means keepin' it realUhh, where am I going? 
 Where am I? Where the hell am I? 
 Yo, it's ill... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me 
 Life tries ducking me 
 Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time 
 Mac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm 
 Like Christion, watching my life go 
 Can´t do myself in 
 Wolves in the night yo, hell's men 
 Two revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz 
 Push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me? 
 My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience 
 Telling me that I ain't shit 
 No matter how much cash I sit wit' 
 Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness 
 My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain 
 To replenish my adolescent brain 
 Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane 
 So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain 
 I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets 
 Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat 
 Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive 
 As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is 
 To maintain, bitches playin' games 
 Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names 
 But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang 
 Lost so many close niggas 
 Drunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast 
 Highway patrol will just flash 
 Lights in my rearview 
 If they stop me, I hope they lock me 
 Instead they speed ahead 
 Yo, nigga, watch me 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once 
 Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts 
 For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves 
 Can't tell these niggas nothing though 
 Bullets wake 'em up well 
 Take 'em to hell 
 Stick up niggas once ran up on me 
 My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me 
 I ain't your mark, homie 
 It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake 
 Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes 
 Could hardly look both ways 
 Put out the haze, blurry vision 
 Think about the time in my life before I was in television 
 Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision 
 Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos 
 But what they not seeing is police expect RICO 
 Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated 
 Windows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me 
 I hate it when I'm like this 
 The bottle's my accomplice 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 Yo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The reason that I want to be alone 
 Tired of all the things that went wrong 
 That would have went right if I would have did it on my own 
 Take another swig 
 The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts 
 Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down 
 Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through 
 Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true 
 Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately 
 Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again 
 To keep my mind off that weak shit 
 There's love through it all 
 Things to live for 
 I swerve, almost crash into a wall 
 Think about the good, find myself laughing 
 Turn the cell off, no way to be reached 
 Know I'm near my crib 
 Tryna see my way through the streets 
 Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home 
 Start to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip 
 Bring my ass to the crib, I'm tired... 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself, all alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself[Intro: Nas] 
 Damn 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid 
 When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
 Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done 
 Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son 
 I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough 
 He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff 
 I was like, "Yeah," your girl don't care, she a snake too 
 Messin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach 
 It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime 
 Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's 
 Is more trife than ever 
 What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together? 
 If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest 
 Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my dawg when push came to shove 
 (One what?) One love! 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 One love, one love, one love 
 We should write letters to one another 
 Now they email you from jail, right? 
 Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love 
 Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in New York the same shit is goin' on 
 The crackheads stalkin' 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin' 
 That nigga you shot last year tried to appear 
 Like he hurtin' somethin' 
 Word to mother 
 And he be pumpin' on your block 
 Your man gave him your Glock 
 And now they run together — what up, son? 
 Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a 
 But I heard you blew a dude with a...for the phone piece 
 Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira 
 Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
 But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours 
 On the reals, all these crab dudes know the deal 
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next V-I 
 I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks 
 Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it lowkey 
 So stay civilized, time flies 
 Though incarcerated your mind dies 
 I hate it when your moms cries 
 It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala 
 I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 We keep it 100 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love 
 Here's the summary, for the whole shit 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world, thinkin' 
 "How can we exist through the facts?" 
 Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects 
 I take my pen and pad for the weekend 
 Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin' 
 A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home 
 You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible 
 Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue 
 Or H..., hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop 
 Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em 
 He said: "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof 
 So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce." 
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black 
 I was chillin' on the corner 
 Where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard 
 Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit 
 Told him don't let niggas fool him 
 ‘Cause when the pistol blows 
 The one that's murdered be the 
 Tough luck when niggas are..., families fucked up 
 Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up 
 At the crowd, catch him solo 
 Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only twelve, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes 
 Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze 
 Left some jewels, he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 One love, one love, one love, one love 
 Real shit 
 "Represent" 
 "Represent" 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Lot of dudes I wrote about on that album have passed on 
 And that's [?] specifically 
 Damn, my man George 
 Marty, Yammie 
 There so many of them[Intro] 
 Check me out y'all 
 Nasty Nas in your area 
 About to cause mass hysteria 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Before I blunt, I take out my fronts 
 Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt 
 You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer 
 That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever 
 King poetic. Too much flavor, I'm major 
 Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager 
 Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass 
 40-side is the place that is giving me grace 
 Now wait, another dose and you might be dead 
 And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds 
 And ain't a damn thing gonna change 
 I'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain 
 Nas, why did you do it 
 You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's halftime 
 Hey yo, it's halftime 
 It's halftime 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's like that, you know it's like that 
 I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back 
 When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back 
 So I react never calmly on a hype track 
 I set it off with my own rhyme 
 Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time 
 I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex 
 In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck 
 I used to hustle - now all I do is relax and strive 
 When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5 
 I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it 
 With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach 
 Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise 
 This is exercise 'til the microphone dies 
 Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin' 
 But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and 
 Kick my little raps cause I thought nigga wouldn't understand 
 And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man 
 I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships 
 I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips 
 I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic 
 Versatile, my style switches like a faggot 
 But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual 
 Of rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo 
 These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand? 
 Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man 
 Am I in place with the bass and format 
 Explore rap and tell me "Nas ain't all that" 
 And next time I rhyme, I be foul 
 Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild 
 I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme 
 Stay tuned, Nas soon - the real rap comes at halftime 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's halftime 
 Check it, it's halftime 
 It's halftime 
 We're like that 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I got it going on, even flip a morning song 
 Every afternoon, I kick half the tune 
 And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit 
 Word to Marcus Garvey: I hardly sparked it 
 Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word 
 I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third 
 But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay 
 I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee 
 Putting hits on 5-0 
 Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44 
 And biters can't come near 
 And yo: "go to hell" to the foul cop who shot Garcia 
 I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed 
 That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed 
 This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten 
 Brooklyn and Queens is living fat and 
 The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout 
 Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out 
 Bet you I'm out 
  
 It's still halftime 
 Little greens switch through 
 You know it's halftime 
 Ninety-two 
 It's halftime 
 Halftime 
 The police, man 
 Come on man get out in here 
 Yeah[Verse One:] 
 Yo, the Lord is my shepard 
 The sword is my weapon 
 Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle 
 Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son 
 Cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun 
 Before they choose an education 
 But once dead their ain't no awakenin' 
 So like once said, life ain't for fakin 
 Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em? 
 Fuck waitin' 
 Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation 
 Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan 
 When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination' 
 I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo 
 Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth 
 Is this the truth? 
 This is what we do, sip a brew 
 Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM 
 As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em 
 You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin' 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Okay, you wanna play rough?! 
 (gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes) 
 Okay yo, we could play rough! 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough? 
 Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck 
 I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas 
 Ducked in they seat?  are they lookin' for me? 
 But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought 
 I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did 
 May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit 
 P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips 
 Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is 
 Pull the strap from under the seat 
 Back up in the street 
 Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep 
 Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat 
 Empty every shell in their direction 
 Its you, I should've guessed it! 
 Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you 
 Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 Walked in his house, smackin' him up, "what you talkin' about?" he said 
 Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome 
 Never thought I'd be in his home 
 With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone 
 Fuckin' with me, you should've known 
 I'll have 'em write "stupid nigga" on your tombstone 
 What money can do, get you hit for less than a G 
 For threatenin' me 
 I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free 
 Killin' you niggas with nothin' 
 Left him dead, engine runnin' 
 You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin' 
 Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault 
 They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it 
 But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib 
 For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live 
 Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back 
 I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac 
 Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that? 
 Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats 
 Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react 
 Eye for an eye, cause the sweetest part is payback 
 Somebody kncokin', who dat? 
 "a cop man", let him in 
 And give that mothafucka one under the chin 
 Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds! 
 The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead 
 Dont explain, I put the pound on his head 
 Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said...... 
 Okay, so we gonna play rough! 
  
 [Hook:]"Uh. What?! What?! Uh." 
  
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
  
 [Noise and a gun shot] 
  
 My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square 
 Headed for Delaware wit' one change of gear 
 Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed 
 Wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave 
 Dollars and cents- A fugitive with two attempts 
 Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print 
 Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty 
 I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up for realty 
 For real, G, I'mma fullfill my dream 
 If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M 
 The first trip without the clique 
 Sent the bitch wit' the quarter brick, this is it 
 Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes 
 I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes 
 F' God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million 
 Without the FBI catchin' feelin's 
  
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
  
 From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat 
 Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back 
 Holdin' gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back 
 Livin wit' moms, gettin it on, flushin' crack 
 Down the toilet- Two sips from bein' alcoholic 
 Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou from bein' rich but now I'm all for it 
 My man saw it like Dionne Warwick 
 A wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it 
 The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina 
 Up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina 
 Trina got the fishscale between her 
 The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her 
 She got me back livin' sweeter, fresh Caesar 
 Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins 
 Bitches blow me while hoppin' in the drop-top B-M 
  
 "Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this." 
 ("Uh. What? What? Word?") 
  
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
  
 Ill designer fleece, studded marquise 
 A letta L on my car keys- Thuggin' hard on Cavarse 
 'Posters be Franchesco and all these bets 
 Mobile phones in the armrest, ladies be the bombest 
 I creep tinted, parked the whip and grabbed the rented 
 Seems like I'm changin' my location every minute 
 Like a plague is on my head, son- I vision red rum 
 Warrent squads knockin' at the same time the Feds come 
 Pandemonium got me puffin' Cambodian 
 Grand openin's of barber shops and stock 
 My jew-el rock, tokin' pronto- Livin' like a pablo 
 Papi like a poncho until the state patrollers pulled us over 
 Found the guns and the good 
 Had a nigga like 'Nas had to run through the woods' 
 Sneakin' out the next mornin'- Looked up to God 
 Guess in all this was a fuckin' warnin' 
 Took my diamonds in for the pawnin' 
 Now I'm back on the climbin' 
 Movin' consigned through rain, sleet, whatever climate 
 So many ups and downs shiftin', I was twisted minded 
 'Mazed on top, all the hoes and pussy had me blinded 
 Big lip bitches, suckin' dick rediculous 
 GS'es and vest-es, larger rays lookin' sentious 
 Back on the block buggin', how the fuck I been through this? 
 Nearly caused my life but now I can't show a cent from it 
  
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

 On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin

 And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof 
 Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it 
 With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!! 
 When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you

 "What we need to be thinkin' about is the future! 
 We don't know what's in store tomorrow! 
 All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow; 
 For our family, for our children, for our future 
 But if we don't get up andact like we want it 
 We gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray! 
 You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray! 
 Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today? 
 Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here? 
 Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!" 
  
 [Horse] 
 I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end 
 Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin' 
 Got people witnessin', your co-defendent snitchin' 
 Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin' 
 Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual 
 Scared to face the light of a courtroom site 
 Racist cops on each side cause the know I just might 
 Make a break for the door but I give it my all 
 If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call 
 Cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall 
 Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail 
 Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail 
 I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now 
 Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date 
 Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay 
 To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray 
 For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held 
 And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed 
 Amen 
  
 I only pray when shit is fucked up! 
 I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck! 
 I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs! 
 Callin' out for someone, somewhere! 
 Is there anybody out there? 
  
 [Wiz] 
 I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die? 
 Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me 
 Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me 
 Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin' 
 I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me 
 On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies 
 Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me 
 See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh! 
 Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke 
 Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!' 
 But before I could turn around, before I could I react 
 Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now? 
 Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground? 
 Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple 
 Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple 
 Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin' 
 Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin' 
 Amen 
  
 I only pray when shit is fucked up! 
 I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck! 
 I only pray when I need his help the most, what?! 
 Callin' out to someone, somewhere! 
 Yo, is anybody out there? 
  
 [Jungle] 
 Ain't nothin' stoppin' me - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few 
 Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do 
 Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links 
 Yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think? 
 Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded 
 Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target 
 I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin' 
 I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin' 
 When I come through buckin' this four-fivin' 
 Revenge you sayin' you gettin' 
 But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons 
 So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter 
 Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper 
 Confessions in a church cause it hurts, behind a curtain 
 Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain 
 Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back 
 It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back 
 He set me up, he just got to the preist 
 I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way 
 And said, 'Pray' 
  
 [Nas] 
 "You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray 
 And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh! 
 You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh! 
 You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh! 
 You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong 
 But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong 
 But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin' 
 To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin' 
 To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you 
 To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself 
 And, and, and beg for forgiveness cause it comes back to you! 
 A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray 
 All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God..."[Verse 1:] 
 Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah 
 Fist full of dollars in a dice game god 
 D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings 
 Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful 
 Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor 
 Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor 
 More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em 
 The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming 
 The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up 
 My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus 
 Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers 
 But they small as a shanty in a African village 
 Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers 
 Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia 
 You screaming like you love war 
  
 [Hook: repeat 2X] 
 Everybody's crazy 
 Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop 
 Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop 
 Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop 
  
 [Nas:] 
 Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass 
 You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag 
 You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em 
 8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting 
 Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying 
 No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing 
 Niggas get flashier houses more plusher 
 Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger 
 Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing 
 Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing 
 I'm light year far your mouth get all white 
 When I'm near you I frighten your heart 
 I want you to watch me notice stare look closely 
 Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you 
 Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes 
 Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots 
 War plus money man I got too many spots 
 Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up 
 Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up 
 Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching 
 We all connected so your man know my man 
 Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up 
 Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what 
 Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive 
 Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job 
 Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high 
 Their own my will take the contract surprise 
 So we play a mental game intimidation 
 Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying 
 I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an 
 Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying 
 Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe 
 I got some niggas with acid get it thrown in your face 
 Play dirty catch your moms in J-30 
 Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now 
  
 [Hook:][Spoken: Nas] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Brings me back 
 As you come outside on the block 
 The basketball court was crack and you still played ball 
 Shooting on the rusty rim 
 I lived on the fourth floor 
 Wow, remember those days like yesterday 
 Memories man 
 They feed the soul 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners 
 Henessey-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a 
 Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai 
 I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie 
 Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er 
 My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer 
 Sentence begins indented with formality 
 My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology 
 Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop 
 I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block 
 I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat 
 I can see him drop in my weed smoke 
 It's real, grew up in trife life, murderous night times 
 And knife fights invite crimes 
 Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap 
 With my peeps that's into drug money market interact 
 No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler 
 I guess that means peace 
 For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya 
 Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo 
 With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below 
 Peace God – now the shit is explained 
 I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane 
 It's like that, y'all 
 It's like that, y'all 
 It's like that, y'all, yeah 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Now let me take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Now let us take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Now let us take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Now let us take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Lemme explain 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars 
 Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars 
 I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz? 
 My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses 
 Live amongst no roses, only the drama 
 For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja 
 Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces 
 You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces 
 Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow 
 And back down po-po when I'm vexed so 
 My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank 
 I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank 
 Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail 
 Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales 
 My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails 
 I'll reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real 
 Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats 
 I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "peace" 
 I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats 
 They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black 
 Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing 
 Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin 
 Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still 
 Never talkin' to snakes, ‘cause the words of man kill 
 True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins 
 I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane 
 It's like that, y'all 
 It's like that, y'all 
 Memory lane 
 Nothing like the memories boy 
 Lemme take a trip down (memory lane) 
 Uh, comin' outta Queensbridge 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Now let me take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Remember lookin' out my window pane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Now let us take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 Now let me take a trip down memory lane 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge" 
 "Comin' outta Queensbridge"[Nas] 
 Alright, are you sure 
  
 [Kelis] 
 Yeah, I'm sure 
 So wait, you're telling me there's no- 
 You can't think of anybody 
 In your past, in your dirty dark crazy past (Nas laugh) 
 So if I gave you a free pass, you wouldn't wanna do them just one last time 
  
 [Nas] 
 No 
  
 [Kelis] 
 Come on 
  
 [Nas] 
 No 
  
 [Kelis] 
 I don't believe you, all them- 
 All them bitches? 
 I'm serious, okay I'm saying you have 
 Before we get married you have one free pass 
 I don't need to know about it 
  
 [Nas] 
 Mhm... 
  
 [Kelis] 
 But it's one girl, there's one girl that you had in the past that you could say 
 "You know what? Let me hit that one more time" 
  
 [Nas] 
 Ah, I can't really think of nobody 
 Definitely ain't nobody 'cause I've been there, done that 
 You know, let me go through itThis is what it sounds like 
 When a thugs dies (pow, pow ,pow) (we won’t cry) 
 This is what it sounds like 
 When a thug dies (pow ,pow, pow ) (tears from your mama's eyes) 
  
 When I’m with my niggas this is how it sounds 
 It ain't nothin nigga give my niggas pounds 
 This is what it sounds like when I’m with my hoes 
 Hard dicks bitch you fuckin with a pro 
 This is what I’m thinkin when u bitch niggas plott'en 
 I’m gonna kill this nigga right now I got him 
 This is what he say right before the lead hit him (yo please don’t shoot) 
 Man fuck'em, did him 
 When the cops come this is what a rat say 
 He shot em 4 times and he ran that way 
 Now a nigga on the run, this what real nigga do 
 You can stay at my crib I heard what happened, come thru 
 A bitch or a nigga can help a nigga hide 
 Open up the front door and welcome u inside 
 Coward nigga want war, well then we gonna ride 
 Wit the pump and the 44 and catch a homicide 
  
 This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (your moms cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when a thug die (pow pow pow ) (mamas cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (tears from your mama's eyes) 
  
 At his funeral this is what u heard (oh my god oh my god) 
 Ya that was that nigga's bird 
 And that ***** is foul 
 Do u know that ho's style 
 When u was locked up she had another *****s child 
 The other *****s me, I knew that was his wife 
 What the fuck am I gonna do, bitch is begging for the pipe 
 And I was coming through on the reggy every night 
 But then this nigga came home I said it wasn't right 
 9 months later shit got crazy 
 ***** flipped out when she said it ain't his baby 
 Slapped her up, gun butt her with the nine 
 Put it to her head til she told him it was mine 
 (you fucking bastard I'm gonna bury em 6 feet deep) 
 Heard he looking for me daily, carrying his heat 
 Now he’s under the ground may he rest in peace 
 Cuz he was married to a ho and I was married to the street 
  
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from youe eye) 
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes) 
  
 Its been 2 years ain’t nobody catched me 
 Hennesy and pepsi, my Tech will protect me 
 Out of state made alot of cake, they respect me 
 Got a new identity, hoes want to sex me 
 Havin memories of my seed kind of stress me 
 Cuz my son is 2 and his appearance reflects me 
 Gotta new Lex GS chrome wheels nigga 
 Drove all the way home, man shit is real nigga 
 Got back to the hood it was raining and pouring 
 Knocking on this bitche's door like 3 in the morning 
 She knew I was comin, I saw a cop 2 of em running 
 Let off 4 shots then I caught 2 in the stomach 
 She set me up, the rain and the led wet me up 
 (pow pow pow) that’s the sound of a thug dead cuz 
  
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry) 
 This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes)They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland 
 Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand 
 Illegal smugglin', people strugglin' 
 Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again 
 Yeah, guess that's how we got here 
 Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade 
 Every child's afraid 
 When his Mother and Father get sprayed 
 Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade 
 Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue 
 Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through 
 Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue 
 Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to 
 And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed 
 As I rap with my Platinum chain 
 When you shop for a gift for me 
 You think about the misery? 
 The same way we made Apartheid History 
 We can do the same thing to the conflict ice 
 But everybody wanna shine, right? 
  
 [HooK: Nas] 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed 
 They wanna Shine on 'em 
 Shine on 'em X 7 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 My VVS glimmers on my chest 
 200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist 
 I wonder how people starve to death 
 When God bless the land that lacks the harvest 
 The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty 
 And the whole world ignores the robbery 
 Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me 
 Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity 
 It shocks, so many are killed annually 
 'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity 
 Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it 
 Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded 
 Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive 
 Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly 
 But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine 
  
 [HooK: Nas] 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed 
 Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead 
 Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed 
 They wanna shine on 'em 
 Shine on 'em X 7[Spoken: Nas] 
 So I was talking about this music and uhh 
 To my man earlier, Green Lantern, I said 
 I wrote: "The word best—I'm thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter, my strength. My son, the star will be my resurrection." 
 I didn't know I would have kids at all when I wrote at 20 
 Some years ago, I had a daughter then I had a son just like 
 I setted that rhyme 
 You put down stuff on that paper, you'd be surprised 
 The atmosphere reads it, the universe reads it 
 And hears it, they can hear our thoughts, this universe 
 Be careful what you're thinking because it doesn't know how to differentiate what you mean with those thoughts 
 It will—it will give it to you though 
 I was blessed, I was lucky with that 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (It's yours) 
 (it's—it's—it's—it's yours) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged 
 Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin 
 Behold the mic I'm throbbin', my movement 
 Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe 
 The mind activation, react like I'm facin' 
 Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin' 
 Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets 
 Ralph Lauren on my feet makes my cipher complete 
 Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep 
 I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep 
 I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?) 
 President Barack Obama, he represents me 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 The world is yours 
 It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 Can you believe it? 
 It's your world, it's yours 
 It's mine—it's 
 Can you believe it? 
 I said the world is yours 
 Believe it, yeah 
  
 [Bridge: Nas] 
 To my man Ill Will (God bless your life) 
 To my people right here (bless your life) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I trip, we box up crazy bitches 
 Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures 
 Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's 
 Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul 
 The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child 
 Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled 
 Or caught by the devil's lasso 
 There's no days for broke days 
 We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray 
 Soakin' their sins in trays of holy water 
 Odds against Nas are slaughter 
 Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter 
 My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection 
 Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did 
 He'll lead a right direction 
 How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre 
 You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker? 
 What you are soldier? I thought I told ya 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 It's mine, it's mine (the world) 
 The world, the world, up top 
 It's your world 
 It's mine, it's mine—whose world? 
 The world is yours, the world is yours, uh 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 Break it down 
 Watch what you say 
 Watch what you listen to 
 I've been listening lately and a lot of these days ain't real 
 If I may say so myself 
 Alright, check it 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed 
 For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded 
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne 
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home 
 I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow 
 ‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow 
 Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip 
 Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip 
 And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up 
 Remember that Mike Tyson back in the days? 
 Stabbin' women like the Phantom 
 The crew is lampin', Big Willie style 
 Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild 
 Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge 
 Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames 
 Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 (It's yours) Oh, it's mine, it's mine—whose world? 
 I said the world is yours, the world is yours 
 Whose world? It's yours 
 Whose world? I said the world is yours, the world is yours 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 To my Queens' crew, the foundation 
 The world is yours 
 To my people in B-more 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 To my people in VA 
 The world is yours, the world is yours 
 And the nation capital, you know the world is yours 
 The world is yours 
 Oh, da-da-da da-da-da 
 Smooth it out like that, da-da-da da-da-da 
  
 [Spoken: Nas] 
 Thank youItaliano motto 
 Train like Cus D'Amato 
 Guard your plant 
 Recline low black milano 
 Blessed God feelin kosher 
 One in the top of the toaster 
 ??? 
 My nine is stuck in a holster 
 Dump quick 
 Chasing my dick 
 Made a bum bitch rich 
 Stalefish 
 Heard she naked in jail flicks 
 Mamacita 
 Black widow turned to be a back seater 
 Satin pillows a pimpstress in willow 
 Cookin my blow and heads low 
 Eye swellin 
 The son of the grain 
 I gotta split my wife's melon 
 So I can see the seven seeds of my circumference 
 Beaver lunged it 
 Polishin pistols at the gunsmith 
 Clever 
 My mama told me take cheddar 
 Buy slugs or drugs whatever calculate better 
 When cakes measured 
 Lock the front door secure 
 See the gleaming white crystal when its pure 
  
 Fuck the snake hoes and jealous ass niggas 
 That smash your Benz windows 
 Detecting fake niggas signals 
 Yo live niggas get it too 
 Scarin rappers like the fed time Gotti was acquitted to 
 Bloodshot red eyes, high 
 Yellow envelopes of lye 
 Opening cigars let tobacco fly 
 Kicks matchin my shit my gun on 
 Thinkin of names for my mans unborn 
 Spill the Puerto Rican rum on imaginary graves 
 Put my hat on my waves 
 Latter Day Saints scream religious praise 
 Heat grazed the baby yo 
 Foul shit made a welfare mom crazy 
 More bodies drop by the ratio 
 Paces flow 
 Grisly thoughts for makin dough 
 Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash flow 
 So now its on never wasted a slug 
 Time is money 
 When it comes to mine 
 Take it in blood[Intro: Nas] 
 Man, we love you man, you hear me? 
 This is coming from the General man, Nas man 
 Bravehearts love you man, this is to all of ya niggas 
 Who been using my name from day one to make yourselves famous 
 Whether you shouting me out on your records 
 Whether you try to come at me on your records, or whether you just you know...? 
 You know... you know how you dick riding man? This goes out to ya 
 Cause we love you man, I've done made a lot of niggas famous man 
 But I'm gon' make you...I make you make the papers, this one's for you 
 Ayo, word up 
 It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more 
 Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin? 
 Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds, all that shit 
 Niggas thinking a nigga chilling 
 Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit 
 But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I got the mansion and the nice ride 
 Platinum chain, and an ice watch 
 All this fame in my life's hard 
 I entertain in so many places 
 See so many different faces 
 They look the same from the stages 
 After the concert, hours of long work 
 Home sick from the road, smoking my lungs hurt 
 Even though now I'm recording songs 
 It's better than, when I was peddling, doing wrong 
 I brought the crew along, we thugging 
 Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands 
 Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them 
 Can't even role the streets now, without the heat 
 I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak 
 On trial, what I'ma tell the judge 
 He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury 
 That's when I need celeb status and the blackness 
 This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 My girl hate when I'm with my boys 
 Think I'm cheating, every morning knocking at my door 
 State policeman, give him a reason, but I don't give it to him 
 They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him 
 See, I cooperate until they push me 
 Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy 
 You not fake, can't explain how much I miss the block 
 When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming "Fuck the cops!" 
 Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile 
 Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear 
 I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west" 
 And he told me spit it clear 
 Another hit just made, another album 
 So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding 
 Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo 
 I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me though 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 The haters say I ain't shit 
 Hope I fall, but I can't slip 
 Got to ball, got to bank chips 
 Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ain't amount to nothing 
 Catch my moms on the bench fronting 
 I got to stay awake, got to pray today 
 Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say 
 So many times I ain't wanna rhyme 
 Wanted a normal life where I ain't Nas all the time 
 So many problems too, do what I got to do 
 As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you" 
 I keep laying hits, winners never quits 
 Plus if I stop, how would I stay legit? 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby 
 I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that 
 I made a mil', but that ain't good enough 
 Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up 
 See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby[Spoken: Nas] 
 You know, it's life 
 Life as I know it man 
 This life is crazy 
 I realize that we're all here for a purpose 
 I was lucky to find mine 
 I didn't come from a privileged family 
 I didn't read no fancy books like Outliers or Bounce, and found my way 
 We just rise, right? 
 With no help, we can risw in the wave 
 For me, I needed more than money though 
 I wanted to be heard man 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 20, it's a blessin' 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and 
 My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it 
 One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from 
 My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain 
 When I was young, I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards 
 Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash 
 Got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash 
 Now it's all about cash in abundance 
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!" 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric 
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
  
 [Spoken: Nas] 
 Shoutout to my father Olu Dara 
 This is his horn part he wrote 
 Can we hear the horn? 
 He played that shit so right 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Life's a bitch and then you—then you get high 
 You never know, it's real shit, right? 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Spoken: Nas] 
 Y'all making me high right now, we don't need no weed 
 Yeah, oh 
 Thank you for that[Hook : Kids] 
 I know I can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard at it 
 I'll be where I wanna be 
  
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be 
  
 [Verse 1 : Rakim] 
 I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin 
 A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin 
 Mind stressin tryin to find direction, crime spreading 
 Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11 
 I live fast, hustle like today is my last 
 I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave 
 Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin off 
 Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war 
 The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics 
 Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis 
 The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra 
 Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera 
 So New York City walk with me, talk gritty 
 It's up to us New York it's our city 
 Here the man come with the anthem, hands up 
 It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up 
  
 [Hook : Kids] 
 I know I can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard at it 
 I'll be where I wanna be 
  
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Verse 2 : Nas] 
 For brothers who died from black-on-black violence 
 From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds 
 To clients all over the world, got little Black girls dyin' 
 And can we please pour some more liquors? 
 For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggas 
 Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan 
 It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on 
 Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets 
 And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest 
 And can we please have a moment of truth? 
 For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots 
 And families back home who pray they make it home safe 
 Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles 
 This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you 
 Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you 
 Let's take 'em home 
  
 [Hook : Kids] 
 I know I can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard at it 
 I'll be where I wanna be 
  
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Verse 3 : 2Pac] 
 I want money in large amounts, my garage full of cars that bounce 
 Movin' my tapes in major ways cause every dollar counts 
 Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
 They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump 
 They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary 
 Why you frontin' like you Billy bad-ass, nigga you scary 
 I've been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers, in junior high 
 I was itchin' to kill, and you was, ready to die 
 While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases 
 Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places 
 Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried 
 Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried 
 Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'mma ride 
 Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die 
 It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is 
 Homey got into a fight last night, that killed his kids 
 In this life I lead 
  
 [Hook : Nas + Kids] 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Hook : Kids] 
 I know I can (I know I can!) 
 Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) 
 If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) 
 I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) 
  
 [Bridge : Kids] 
 Ooohh 
  
 [Outro : Nas] 
 Save the music y'all, save the music y'all 
 Save the music y'all, save the music y'all 
 Save the music[Hook: Nas] **2X** 
 'Come Take a Ride' you can fit up in my two-seater 
 Nas a thug you can catch me in my wife beater 
 Blowin' my drugs you know how I like the cheeba-cheeba 
 And if you hatin' and I prolly don't like it either 
  
 [Nas] 
 Fresh dressed like a million bucks 
 Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks 
 I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend 
 Got some hoochies I'mma hook up wit quarter to ten 
 My daughter wit me and we came from the mall 
 Don't need no baby mama drama 
 Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off 
 I hit the car wash at half past four 
 Some kid was star struck 
 I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour 
 My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be 
 I went to the famous Project that they call QB 
 I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb 
 A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word 
 I turned the corner wit my burner and palm 
 Niggas know my name and game I'm a murderous Don 
 Saw my peoples then extended my arm 
 Pulled on the sidewalk, no time to talk 
 If y'all comin' come on; come on! 
  
 [Hook: Nas] **2X** 
  
 [Nas] 
 Talk like a champion, walk like a champion 
 Body like a God and I promise that Nas'll a hit you off 
 Flow like a gangsta, brum bum bum bum bum 
 Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggas off 
 I've been around a couple of times, know how things go 
 I dealt wit 'em all on different occasion 
 The same things'll come in different stages 
 So when them things rise up or pop up 
 I look right past as if its weightless 
 Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process 
 So I can levitate to more important topics 
 Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes 
 20 L's Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses 
 Dippin' in the twilight 
 Wit gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light 
 The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich 
 Bang broads call me Mr. International, ghetto stars come on 
  
 [Hook: Nas] **2X** 
  
 [Nas] 
 Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, haters all fold 
 Cuz my 9 is aimed up, I left four seasons 
 My niggas bleedin' cause of four reasons 
 Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even 
 Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny wit my comrad 
 Conversatin' on what we believe in 
 Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend 
 G's a week in the make freak knees bend 
 I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room 
 They nymphomaniacs prolly lick homegirls womb 
 As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em & shit 
 They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip 
 Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police 
 But when I puffed and coughed 
 Seconds later screamin' "Fuck the Law" 
 Got CD's, TV's, guns tucked in the floor 
 Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more 
 So uh...

 [Intro: Nas] 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up man, this is Nas, hip hop still dead 
 1980's, I need all my pioneers to set it off on this one right here 
 I asked where they are, here they are 
  
 [Verse 1: MC Shan (Nas)] 
 Hip Hop when niggas knew the art of war (Shan!!!) 
 Rough rhymes that's what gave the hard the core 
 Now it's all good best friends became gladiators 
 Matter fact you blow more steam than hot gladiators 
 Some niggas is ghost written but I ain't hatin (80's!!!) 
 Cause I still spit fire like the Son of Satan 
 Shan motherfucker and I'm Queensbridge bred 
 Check Myspace (Queens!!!) Forever will they bare my face 
  
 [Verse 2: Raheem from The Furious Five (Nas)] 
 Who said lightnin can't strike in the same place twice 
 Trailblaze the game, made for life stayed nice 
 Yeah you made the Top 50, don't mention my name (Here they are!!!) 
 I had you open before crack, cocaine grow-in 
 Before The Fever, before +Missy's+ first +Misdemeanor+ 
 Before Run's, first pair of Adidas, got heaters 
 And I pop pop, pop, pop, heaters 
 Stop dealers, on my block was the first hot wheeler 
  
 [Verse 3: Doctor Ice from UTFO (Nas)] 
 You never knew (1980's y'all!!!) Somethin so butter could come from the gutter 
 I'm, Doctor Ice the diamond the cutter 
 Like, Jacob The Jeweler and Rick is The Ruler (UTFO!!!) 
 Boogie Down Kris is The Teacher but Doc run the schoolin 
 Y'all got y'all, sneakers and beepers, your dutches and reefas 
 We got our, eight tracks and sneakers, our hookers and reefers 
 My work is, never in vain, born to insert 
 So even when I'm buried, I'm still the diamond in the dirt, let's work 
  
 [Verse 4: Kangol from UTFO (Nas) {Ladies Screaming Kangol's name}] 
 {Go Kangol!!} Yeah what's up fam? 
 My chick for twenty years tried to cut your man 
 She tried to take the house, the kids, the pots and pans 
 I'm on to project Plan B, nigga fuck Roxanne!!! (Get focused y'all!!!) 
 Tried to take the pot I piss in, now the chick outta my system 
 The whooped niggas need to listen listen listen listen 
 Cock aim fire don't you miss 'em miss 'em miss 'em 
 And every chance you get you diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!) 
 {Aww man, make me feel like I'm back in the days with my cassette player, tape in the radio y'all!!!} 
 (Where are they now?) 
 {Your man Nas, I asked y'all where they at? The pioneers I got love for them man that's why I'm doin this} 
 {I got love for them man, so here they are two thousand and seven, yeah} 
 (HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?) 
  
 [Verse 5: Kool Moe Dee (Nas)] 
 Where am I? On high with a pen 
 Blessed manifest rhyme god transcend (Pay attention y'all) 
 You call him God's Son, I call him God sent 
 First the God sent me, then the God Rakim 
 How can Nas not win when the God sent him 
 To resurrect true rhyme God kingdom 
 You should say amen when you see me 
 When you pray I'm him then you believe me 
  
 [Verse 6: Sha Rock from Funky Four +1 (Nas)] 
 Yeah! Sha ready to rise, ready to blaze somethin 
 Mother of the mic so I'm here to claim somethin 
 I got the munchies for the vultures that crushed the culture 
 Yo Nas brought us back on this track so bring it back (They don't stop y'all!) 
 From dusk to dawn equip the mic on my palm 
 I bring the love so you can get it on 
 Got the books on lock, mother of hip hop 
 For realla, come under from some of you niggas 
  
 [Verse 7: Tito from Fearless Four (Nas)] 
 You cats is foul frontin like you hard as a rock 
 When these brothers were the buildin blocks, that made you turn up the box 
 Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew, To Markie D and Cool Rock (Know your history y'all!!!) 
 Rest in peace to the Human Beat Box (Know your history!) 
 Like when I first heard Jay, Darryl and Joe, saw a UTFO 
 I knew right then and there I wanna blow 
 There need to be a museum where everybody could see 'em 
 Said everybody take some pedium, and get respect 
  
 [Verse 8: Grandmaster Caz from The Cold Crush Brothers] 
 You got another thing comin if you think me and my man ain't sellin 
 Got more gold than Mr. Drum and we sellin 
 Through Welcome To The Terrordome, niggas are ever wrong 
 That's why you get no ends, but just in case 
 You got a death wish, for flare for the dramatics 
 There's some static in the attic {?} hid it looking at it 
 I'm a 'matic, nice to the fifth power son and I'm still at it 
 I was about to flip power son 'til I saw a vision, Caz!!! 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!) 
 {Grandmaster Caz, y'all know what this is do y'all know what this means!!!} 
 {The fact, that each brother got on this track, the fact, that each sister got on this track} 
 (Where are they now?) 
 {To rap, took time out of there schedule, when y'all ain't even got no love} 
 {But they still givin y'all love, that's hip hop y'all} 
 (HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?) 
 {Give it up to the OG's the original gangstas of Rap, yeah} 
  
 [Verse 9: Linque AKA Isis from X-Clan] 
 Nas you had to ask Linque, where you been? 
 Rippin on the mics with the devilish grin 
 Sort of like a tack cause I stay under they skin 
 Cause when I open up my mouth I blow them chicks to the wind 
 Don't get besides yourself like you Siamese twins [Professor X:] ("This is protected!") 
 Still got the pen to make the ?message of sin? ("By the red, the black") 
 You bring it back I do it over again ("and the green") 
 Exposin those who pretend, stay on my grind 'til the end 
  
 [Verse 10: Dana Dane (Nas)] 
 First there was a tree and a MC grew and became (Brooklyn!) 
 Another rapper born in Queens, 9/6 the b-day 
 Moms moved and born {?}, dad hit the freeway 
 My young life was screenplay, better yet a cliché (I can't believe it!) 
 To rap in the eight-tay, no lenses in the east-say? 
 They say we were a fad but fad don't add reggae 
 We played by the D-Day, eveyday, Eve's day 
 Capital D-A-N-E and hip hop, must be in it 
  
 [Verse 11: Pebblee Poo from Def Committee (Nas)] 
 C'mon! Well I'm the ?wa-say-why? with the with the same crew 
 First name Pebblee, last name Poo (Oh!) 
 Gina Parks? says a {?} I'm a leader, theiver, greeter 
 Last mark the game like Run and them Adidas (Do the history ya'll!!!) 
 I'm a real estate investor but, I still blessed her 
 Microphone teacher outta Alpha Four ?"Beavers? 
 Hold on I get deeper, dope b-boy speaker 
 Practice what I preach-a, DAMN I'm a keepr, huh 
  
 [Verse 12: Just Ice (Nas)] 
 Just the mic and make 'em stand up [RAW!] 
 Lyrics are legendary status so get ya hands up 
 Clap to the freestyle (Just Ice!) dance, but in the meanwhile 
 Cool calm collected, smooth that's how I get down 
 Then at the stage, hold 'em up like a twelve gauge 
 Page after page, all you see is a pure rage! 
 So pass the gat, grab ?taps? for the beat 
 Just Ice signing off [Whaaat?!] Yo I'm out y'all, PEACE!!!!! 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 Yo that's incredible man play that again!!!Yo, this is Nas, the rebel to America 
 I load the clips 'til my lips are crass, cracked 
 Like a vet buggin' out from flashbacks 
 My raps, I shoot at your skull and leave ya sprung 
 I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns 
 Paragraph wizard makin' mics malfunction 
 I blow the fuse with the style I choose 
 Science is dropped, my raps are toxic 
 My voice-box locks and excels like a rocket 
 Nas assassinates the Pope with a scope 
 I mutilate mics 'til my voice-box is broke 
 Try to battle me and gasp for breath 
 Words I speak is a step beyond death 
 A rappin' Charles Manson, I'm just that odd 
 I'm so strong, long enough to box with God 
 I throw a pitch at your brain so try and catch it 
 My thought are bugged 
 My brains should be put in a straitjacket 
 I'm nastier than cannibalism 
 I'm as sharp as a shank in prison, thoughts abrupt, risen 
 My rap is a ritual of Satan 
 Though I'm not demonic, my voice is electronic 
 My brain is deranged 
 In a metamorphic change, my sound waves are strange 
 Many say that I'm propelled to Hell 
 But I met the Devil and wrecked his brain cell 
 Police murderer, I love to kill a black cop 
 Nasty Nas is as deadly as a crack spot 
 And smoke a mic like a fiend 
 I use a TEC 9 like I was ??????? 
 I go on till the break of dawn 
 Breakin' raps in half, my word is bond 
 It's like that and, uh, I go on and on 
 Akinyele, rock the mic till the mic is torn[Intro - Rising Son] 
 Yo 
 Ha, Ha, Ha 
 DPP 
 Check, one two, one two 
 Who got more style than Son do? 
 None do (that's official) 
 Yeah, this is history right here (history) 
 Yo, Nas, Rising Son 
 Queensbridge to London 
 Let's go.. 
  
 [Verse One - Rising Son] 
 Yo, Yo 
 This is the Thief's Theme 
 For the underground criminal street teams 
 Street dream chasing young hungry thugs that seek cream 
 Crack fiends and hatch schemes, knife-point robbery 
 Broad day blindeys, night-time thuggery 
 Sun down shinanigins, move without shadow... 
 ...like ninjas, cat burglars, no fiasco 
 No commotion, make moves like locomotion 
 Crack-sport ambush, get the man bringing the coke in 
 Warehouse crime rate, mans throw they vans up 
 Bang job, "Freeze, everybody put your hands up" 
 Cash is nightmare, gun in ya faceplate 
 "It's not even ya money, don't make me put one in ya face, mate" 
 Thieves running this place, world trade, eight fare 
 Slave rift flashbacks; Bush killer, hate Blair! 
 Wish Mars was a mile away, cos I would escape there 
 On a Skyway railroad, to stick you from my tray fair, bitch... 
  
 Yeah, you know like when you kill somebody in Street Fighter 
 Uah, uah, uah, uah (fades) 
  
 [Re-Intro, Nas] 
  
 One, two 
 Check, one, two 
 One, two, who got more style, the son do 
 {*rewind*} 
 One, two 
 Check, one, two 
 One, two, who got more style, the son do 
 Check, one, two 
  
 [Verse 2 - Nas] 
 Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit 
 On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot 
 Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas 
 Little kids scared cops, wit red dots 
 Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors 
 Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers 
 Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires 
 Flash iron, anybody tryin on, the blocks I'm supplyin on 
 Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up 
 And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em 
 Cops see them and run, don't want no drama 
 Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of 
 Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota 
 Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace 
 He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians 
 From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts 
 Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh 
 Lightning hits the top of the church steeple 
 When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen 
 It's frightening.... {*scratches*} 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
 The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right 
 Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit 
  
 [Verse 3 - Nas] 
 I take summers off, cause I love winter beef 
 Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep 
 Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill 
 Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd 
 Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth 
 Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains 
 Smellin like trees, sensimille on the brain 
 Skeemin on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain 
 Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap 
 Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks 
 Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises 
 Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys, it's 
 .... Just another day in the hood 
 And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good 
 We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em 
 But our style was let them pile then, we robbin 'em 
 Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes 
 Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin 
 And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life 
 For the thief's who come out at night 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Outro] 
 One, two 
 Check, one, two {*echoes*} 
 One, two 
 Check, one, two 
 One, two, who got more style, the son do {*echoes*} 
 {*explosion*}[Intro:] 
 Yeah 
 I want all my niggas to come journey with me 
 My name is Nas, and the year is 1973 
 Beginning of me, therefore I could see 
 Through my belly button window who I am... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I existed in a womb, just like an abyss 
 Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist 
 Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix 
 Twitching cause I'm nervous 
 Thought my intended purpose 
 Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain 
 But to take on a name, my pops chose for me 
 Bloodstream full of indo 
 Developing eyes looking out my belly button window 
 My father's face wears a frown 
 And I'm wondering if they even want me around 
 Cause I'll go back to spirit town 
 So I could rest longer before I come back down 
 The chute again, in the near future when 
 My moms and pops can agree on this 
 Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist 
 He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont 
 You got a 120 days do what you want 
 But as for me coming back this be my last time 
 Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind 
  
 [Hook: Nas] 
 I shot my way out my mom dukes 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive 
 Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive 
 When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes 
 I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live 
 Move side to side hear loud music and vibe 
 All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie 
 Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube 
 I'm covered in this thick layer of goo 
 Month two was the least most comfortable 
 My umbilical cord choking me 
 But month 3 was closer, see 
 Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic 
 But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute 
 Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well 
 Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell 
 While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall 
 I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all 
 This place they call the world though my view was so large 
 Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge 
 Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July 
 But the Lord already figured out a date and time 
 Septemeber 14th, 73 
 Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me 
 Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop 
 See how the goverment will start re-training cops 
 Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced 
 Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too 
 Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on 
 Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out 
 Everything blurry, my first breath screams out 
 Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud 
 Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody 
 They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!" 
 Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother 
 Finally, I got to see who held me in her body 
 She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil 
 Y'all bout to see this world in trouble 
 Motherfuckers...[NOTE: Lyrics are not complete] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 So you call yourself a God MC, Jay-Hova 
 Drunk the glass of blasphemy and forgot to pray over 
 Your game's over 
 Crossed the warpath of a brave soldier 
 You're a makeover 
 My protege trying to Takeover 
 I was the shepherd that led you 
 But you bit the hand that fed you 
 Mad 'cause since I met you I never did respect you 
 And as hard as it seems 
 You know that I fathered your dreams 
 You was a groupie always begging to be part of my team 
 Another case of a boy and his teacher 
 I was the first to poison your speakers 
 So kill all that noise that you're preaching 
 I understand, all your plans to underhand 
 Aired threats of you pullin' my card next Summer Jam 
 Let me make this clear Hova 
 You had my left overs 
 She told me your little problem of the day when you slept over 
 But that's another subject homie 
 [?] you phony 
 I'm coming to collect the debt from the years that you owe me 
 So what you capitalized, only cause I allowed 
 I'm taking aim at your dome 
 And reclaiming my throne 
 Who said I that I ain't still nasty? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 How you planned on facing 
 The half man half-amazing 
 Don't need a fam', Nas is a one man invasion 
 Claim you hot but you flopped with your R.O.C-familia 
 'Cause real recognize real and you're not familiar 
 Call yourself gangsta' but you were begging for pardon 
 That night in Carbon, when Terror Squad flipped on your squadron 
 Tried to front on their checks 
 Till Pun put a gun to your chest 
 You said it yourself dog, Nas is one of the best 
 Don't need to search for some dirt to expose you 
 I leave it up to the flow dispose you 
 When I oppose you 
 This is it, I'm calling ya' 
 Come out and play like “warriors” 
 Studied my blueprint then pieced together your formula 
 Guess the knowledge I speak too deep to follow 
 That's why your stomach too weak to swallow 
 The real truth that Nas is the greatest of all timers 
 Fuck skeletons, keep only weaponry in my closets[Hook x2] 
 Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want war with no one 
 When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run 
 You mouth got in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want it with no one 
 ... niggas now are after you and here they come 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 This nigga thinkin that everybody puss til he got his shit push 
 Lot of shit poppin, got him all swiss cheesed up 
 He fell to his knees and wished he never released words from outta his mouth bout the next man's Gs 
 Telling me that he was heavenly involved to rob 
 Any nigga who scared to murder who had cash 
 Didn't deserve the convertible cars, sipping bourbon at bars 
 He feel if they ain't real he should get stuck, him and his peoples 
 You must be sniffing that diesel 
 Cause if that nigga knew you was scheming he would just leave you in pieces 
 Plus he's a friend of ours, we got our Benz's that power 
 Motor cars hung on the wire, left summers puff party 
 Plus you don’t get enough really never meant ..laugh and threat 
 .. That they wouldn’t budge they play the .. 
  
 [Hook (little different)] 
 Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want war with no one 
 When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run 
 You mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want war with no one 
 ... niggas now are after you and here they come 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 These niggas live after death before ... 
 I got you we smoke the same weed, same cars we drive 
 Knew two of these dudes got into murder shit just last year 
 I start fuck with them thinking make me lose my career 
 We still touch though its just dough 
 I make some songs that ... on they dirty money just smell wrong 
 But I don't knock you because we come from the same upbringing 
 I came up slinging, the same way they came up slinging 
 One thing I learn though, still judge niggas by it 
 Say alot about men who contend but can't be quiet 
 The school from which I learn is the street of old 
 Fuck fools they talk to worm in six feet hole 
 Be telling niggas what I'm eatin, what I’m holding, its sickening 
 Don't be conerned with what I'm eating, cause what I eat you ain't shittin 
 These niggas that start beef, they talk like bitches 
 And I'm the type to give you ... 
 Yo, black stocking cap on my face pulled down 
 From behind, all you hear is the gun cock back sound 
 And now I put it in yo mouth, fuck you were sayin? 
 Suck on this you trip, try to duck and imma spray ya 
  
 [Hook (little different)] 
 Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want beef with no one 
 When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run 
 You mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want war with no one 
 ... niggas now are after you and here they come 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You make promises that you can keep full of deceit 
 Street face swallow pride ...talk to you money shit 
 You wana run with it .. talk about shit 
 You ain't’ get none of it 
 You whisper got bitch unless is for the real 
 Always ..tryin' to ..can’t remember I said ..fire on you .. 
 If .. run off ‘cause the things gotta 
 You ain’t get no wings ..but ends 
 How ... I’m going blow to you I expect to win 
  
 [Hook (little different)] 
 Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun 
 Know when you don't want war with no one 
 When the .. niggas after you where you gonna run 
 You mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out 
 Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun

 It ain't hard to tell 
 (Nasty) 
 (Nasty) 
 (Nasty) 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail 
 The mic is contacted, I attract clientele 
 My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining 
 Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion! 
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing 
 Cause in my physical, I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x2 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell 
 I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a Tec with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose 
 Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x2 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again 
 Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks 
 MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep, I never fail 
 Nas's raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Hook:] x2 
  
 [Outro:] x5 
 (Nasty!)[Intro] 
 New York city in the early morning after a night of no electric power. What it did have in the dark streets was a wild outburst of crime. Arson, looting, mugging, and a thousand false fire alarms. At 9:34 last night it all went black 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I pour some Yac for the days of way back 
 The turn tables crates of wax turn to major to my earlier days 
 My world was ablaze, black outs in the summer 
 No electricity asked out 
 Breaking down doors, my city was hungry 
 We vandalized stores, poor 
 No lights in the project hall 
 Before the lootin' only 5 DJ crews was movin' 
 Till people stole DJ equipment the numbers risin' 
 Now there's friction 
 First time in Bronx history DJ's poppin' up, there's more mixin' 
 Everybody wants to be Flash 
 His name on the flier 
 The Grandmaster performin' live, no acclaim was higher 
 He was king and the dream was to be like 'em 
 Meanwhile C-Cypher's not around 
 Firehouses shut down 
 School was closed 
 Grandmaster (?) our domes with rules 
 Written inside the rap scrolls 
  
 [Interlude] 
 The revolution will not be televised 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The revolution may not be televised 
 And we wonderin' who the hell is Koch 
 This man Koch wanted the mayor's seat 
 And he's campaignin' like he can't be stopped 
 Up in the Bronx they forever strong 
 Don't ever try to play 'em weak 
 The revolution may not ever be televised 
 Books command the speech 
  
 [Outro] 
 I want to stress first my total outrage that at this hour the city of New York is still without power[Hook] 
 Yellow bird, yellow bird, yellow bird don't fly away x2 
 Not today 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm in the game 
 Women only want my money or fame 
 Or they heard that Kendrick put them on blast 
 Or they feel I had so much ass 
 "What could he want from me? When he can have whoever he wants for company?" 
 The like, "he a slut, he a ho, he a freak 
 He my childhood crush, wish I met him '03 
 Now I need a simple life with a Christian man" 
 I was like, fuck it, get this money, get this power, keep slutting 
 Then I bumped into a cutie, looking at her 
 Not in a lusted matter, but in we need an introduction matter 
 Need her like fresh water from the springs of Florida 
 She hot for reasons more than one 
 Underneath the balling sun in Coachella where a I met her 
 She was staring 
 Since we began to hang, she my number one thing 
 Tell me your troubles, I'll listen, I'll try to numb your pain 
 You like to hug a king, I call you the color queen 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Oh burn me love, it's not a drug nor complexion necessarily 
 It's an expression the canary sings 
 If that canary don't sing, I train her 
 On the wings of love, I took the top from the Wrangler 
 She riding shotgun with her shades on, a day will come 
 I'll put a natural yellow rock on your finger 
 Born a queen, love looking at you, smile made me change up 
 You a bright sunny morning, sex, amazing 
 I said it since day one, we was meant to be 
 When you put my clothes on and started posing like a G 
 Playfully with my chain then you liked what you see 
 Loving how daddy do it, no one quite like me 
 No games, no side chicks, me and my ride or die chick 
 We see eye to eye, maybe not when your heels are five inch 
 You so fly, you so mine, it's me you dine with 
 Fucking Nas with, later on we spawn 
  
 [Hook]Verse One: 
 What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid 
 When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
 Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done 
 Plus congratulations you know you got a son 
 I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flippin, talkin about he acts too rough 
 Ge didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff 
 I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too 
 Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jone's beach, it's bugged 
 Plus little rob is selling drugs on the dime 
 Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's 
 At night time it's more trife than ever 
 Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together? 
 If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest 
 Say whassup to herb, ice and bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my nigga when push came to shove 
 One what? 'One Love' 
  
 Verse Two: 
 Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in New York the same shit is going on 
 The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking 
 The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something 
 Word to mother, I heard him fronting 
 And he be pumping on your block your man gave him your Glock 
 And now they run together, what up son, whatever 
 Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease 
 But I heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece 
 Wiling on the island but now with el mara 
 Better chill 'cos them niggas will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
 But maintain when you come home the corner's ours 
 On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal 
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next VI 
 I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks 
 Your brother's buck wiling in four maine he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key 
 So stay civilized, time flies though incarcerated your mind dies 
 I hate it when your mom's cries 
 It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a 
 I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but One Love 
  
 Verse Three: 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
 Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects 
 I take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting Ls while I'm sleeping 
 A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home 
 You see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
 Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Belle Vue 
 Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop 
 Rolling two phillies together, in the bridge we call them oowops 
 He said Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof 
 So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black 
 We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard 
 Keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit 
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him 
 'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one 
 Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up 
 Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up 
 At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed 
 Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
 Then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose 
 Left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for Jake shorty I'm out 'One Love'[Intro] 
 The scientist is a man who was learned how to think 
 At least about scientific matters 
 That's why he can do so many amazing things 
 But a scientist isn't supposed to believe anything much 
 Unless its supported by evidence... 
  
 [Verse] 
 Lame foot soldiers get croaked in my vicinity 
 The ode for old murder, criminal activity 
 Diamond encrusted bracelets, escape death 
 Cars and yachts, I flaunt things that say success 
 Flow to the water turns my electric chair on 
 Inside the LeBaron trunk, got Pakistan her-on 
 Nasir Jones, not a Capo, the Picasso, word painter 
 Black Sinatra, rap King Cole, gangsta 
 Point blank body armor 
 I'm violence, you're the Dalai Lama 
 You just holla dramaFind a room to lock yourself in and close the door 
 It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore 
 We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw 
 The rhetoric of martin king just saint around no more 
  
 Dave Bowie ain't here James Baldwin neither 
 They all were leaders 
 But they ain't help me get this porch two seater 
 A lawyer left the hood he never looked back 
 To be a fortune 500 C.E.O it took rap 
  
 So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back 
 The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack 
 Marketing companies thats hiring blacks 
 Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads 
  
 The controversy surrounds who could say it and win 
 Some niggas are full time some play and pretend 
 So fuck that no apologies on the issue 
 If it offends you 
 It's meant to 
 It's that simple 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory 
 Too late I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas) 
 Speak my name and breath life in me 
 Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life) 
 'Cause y'all use my name so reckless 
 Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it) 
 And I love especially when y'all do it in public 
 And I'm the subject 
 'Cause y'all my niggas 
  
 Yo I was thinking a little bit what would it take 
 To authenticate my nigganess 
 Ball ridiculous 
 26 inches when I call up the dealership 
 Yeah that's some nigga shit 
  
 We only out for our own benefit 
 We havin' too many kids 
 Recordings, welfare recipients 
 The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit 
 It makes me think what the hell they clean their syringes with 
  
 Everybody bleedin' 
 The cops are the demons 
 Courtrooms full of goons 
 Jail busher's leanin' 
  
 Handcuffs squeezed too tight 
 On you've life 
 If you fight they just give in 
 People used to do sit ins 
  
 They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries 
 Somehow Niger turned to nigga 
 And shit got ugly 
 The problem is we started thinking like the colonists 
 'til Noble Drew Ali 
 Started droppin' that consciousness 
  
 [Chorus] 
 My father was not a banker 
 Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper 
 Who the hell was gonna train us 
 A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages 
 We changed the basis of derogatory phrases 
  
 And I say its quite amazing 
 The use the ghetto terms developed our own language 
 No matter where it came from 
 Its celebrated now people are mad if they ain't one 
  
 [Talking] 
  
 [Chorus: x 2][Verse 1] 
 What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid 
 When the cops came you should have slid to my crib 
 Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done 
 Plus congratulations, you know you got a son 
 I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough 
 He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff 
 I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too 
 Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach 
 It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime 
 Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines 
 And night time is more trife than ever 
 What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together? 
 If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest 
 Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? (One love) 
  
 [Hook: Nas and Q-Tip] x5 
 One Love 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in New York the same shit is going on 
 The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking 
 That nigga you shot last year tried to appear 
 Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting 
 And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock 
 And now they run together, what up son, whatever 
 Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease 
 But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece 
 Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira 
 Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
 But maintain when you come home the corner's ours 
 On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal 
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next V-I 
 I gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks 
 Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home, play it low key 
 So stay civilized, time flies 
 Though incarcerated your mind die, I hate it when your moms cries 
 It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala 
 I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love 
  
 [Hook: Nas and Q-Tip] x5 
 One Love 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
 Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad 
 For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping 
 A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home 
 You see the streets had me stressed something terrible 
 Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue 
 Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop 
 Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oo-wops 
 He said "Nas, niggas cold be busting off the roof 
 So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black trey-deuce" 
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black 
 We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard 
 Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit 
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him 
 Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one 
 Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up 
 Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up 
 At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed 
 Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes 
 Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man I'mma ghost, I paused 
 Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love 
  
 [Hook: Nas and Q-Tip] x10 
 One Love[Intro] 
 Yeah 
 I want all my niggas to come journey with me 
 My name is Nas, and the year is 1973 
 Beginning of me, therefore I could see 
 Through my belly button window who I am... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I existed in a womb, just like an abyss 
 Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist 
 Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix 
 Twitching cause I'm nervous 
 Thought my intended purpose 
 Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain 
 But to take on a name, my pops chose for me 
 Bloodstream full of indo 
 Developing eyes 
 Looking out my belly button window 
 My father's size 
 On his face he wears a frown 
 And I'm wondering if they even want me around 
 Cause I'll go back to spirit town 
 So I could rest longer before I come back down 
 The chute again, in the near future when 
 My moms and pops can agree on this 
 Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist 
 He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont 
 You got 120 days do what you want 
 But as for me coming back this be my last time 
 Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 "I shot my way out my mom dukes" 
 "I shot my way out my mom dukes" 
 "I shot my way out my mom dukes" 
 "I shot my way out my mom dukes" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive 
 Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive 
 When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes 
 I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live 
 Move side to side hear loud music and vibe 
 All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie 
 Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube 
 I'm covered in this thick layer of goo 
 Month two was the least most comfortable 
 My umbilical cord choking me 
 But month 3 was closer, see 
 Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic 
 But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute 
 Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well 
 Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell 
 While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall 
 I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all 
 This place they call the world through my view was so large 
 Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge 
 Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July 
 But the Lord already figured out a date and time 
 Septemeber 14th, '73 
 Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me 
 Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop 
 See how the goverment will start re-training cops 
 Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced 
 Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too 
 Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on 
 Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out 
 Everything blurry, my first breath screams out 
 Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud 
 Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody 
 They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!" 
 Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother 
 Finally, I got to see who held me in her body 
 She loved me, and, yo, I plan to overthrow the devil 
 Y'all bout to see this world in trouble 
 Motherfuckers[dmx - dialogue] 
 I ain't goin back to jail 
 Next time, the county or the state see me 
 It's gonna be in a bag 
  
 Uhh! this is it baby! 
 End of the road, ha hah! 
 When you a dawg, you a dawg for life! 
 You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though 
 You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon! 
  
 [method man] 
 Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe 
 From the friday the 13th, ghetto jason 
 Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass 
 Out that s-class for fakin, forty-fo' blast 
 Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path 
 Ain't no love here, just slugs here 
 Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible 
 For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable 
 Third eye watchin you, watchin me 
 Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea 
 Young g we was born to die, don't cry for me 
 Just keep the heat closely and ride for me 
 Cause we family for better or worse, you and i 
 From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt 
 To be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer 
 For deceased peers, holdin fort 
 Police line 'do not cross', they found his corpse 
 In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked 
 Homicide the crime method, add another 
 Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale 
  
 [lennox speaking - movie dialogue] 
 Who wan' test me, c'mon! 
 Me shot pussy-hole fi fun 
  
 [nas escobar] 
 Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring 
 Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem 
 My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl 
 In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin 
 Lil' blood got popped, by the group home cat 
 Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats 
 Fiend yellin out, who got those? go and see 
 Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough 
 Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases 
 Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper 
 Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers 
 And god'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us 
  
 May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest 
 The mayor wanna call the swat team to come and kill us 
 But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live 
 To get revenge, and we ride to the end 
 Bravehearts blow the lye with henn, and still rise 
 Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's 
 And only five in, the belly of the beast 
 Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets 
 It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat 
 And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth 
 We slangin to eat, bringin the heat 
 Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh 
  
 Chorus: ja rule (repeat 2x) 
 When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die) 
 My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye) 
 Give us one shot at life (let us fly) 
 Come on niggas! (we dawgs for life) 
  
 [dmx and lakid {dialogue}] 
 There's mad money out here dawg 
 Mad money out here 
 What you tryin to get it? (word up) 
 You gonna bust your gun to get it? (tsh, whatever yo) 
 I hear you I hear you 
  
 [dmx] 
 Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem 
 Pinch myself to wake up, cause I know it's a dream 
 Niggas that don't know me see me and think i'ma rob em 
 Niggas that know me well see me and think i'ma problem 
 I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood 
 But word to God I turn your last name to underwood 
 Cause if I see it, i'ma take it and run with it, that's me 
 What type of bullshit is this nigga on? that's d 
 The dawg come and getcha outside 
 The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed 
 Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you 
 Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you 
 Drama, it's right here, how much you need? 
 Beat you down with gat see how much you bleed 
 How much you plead, for your life, you was a killer 
 And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer 
 Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime 
 One more nine, c'mon cry nigga 
 It's over! this is the shit, that hits hard 
 You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Italiano model, trained like Cus D'Amato 
 Guard ya plan, recline low, black Milano 
 Bless God, feelin' Kosher 
 One in the top of the toaster, proper ghost ya 
 My gun is cocked in the holster, dumped quick 
 Chasin' my dick made a bum bitch rich, stylish 
 Heard ya naked in jail flicks 
 Mama cita, Black Widow, Turner be a back seater 
 Satin pillows, a pimpstress in willow 
 Cookin' my blow and head slow, eyes swellin' 
 Disorder the grain, I gotta split my wife melon 
 So I can see the seven seas of my circumference 
 [?], polishin' pistols like a gunsmith 
 Clever, my mama told me, "Take cheddar 
 By slugs and drugs, whatever calculate better" 
 When cake's measured, lock the front door, secure 
 See the gleamin' white crystal when it's pure

 [Verse 2] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Fuck the snake hoes 
 And jealous ass niggas that smash your Benz windows 
 Detectin' fake nigga signals 
 Yo, live niggas get it, too 
 Scarin' rappers like the Fed time Gotti was acquitted to 
 Blood-shot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye 
 Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly 
 Kicks matchin' my shit, my gun on 
 Thinkin' a name for my man's unborn, spillin' Puerto Rican rum on Imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves 
 Latter Day Saints, scream religious praise 
 Heat graze the baby, yo, foul shit made a welfare mom crazy 
 Mo' bodies drop by the ratio, paces blow 
 Grizzly thoughts for makin' dough 
 Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash-flow 
 So, now it's on, never wasted a slug 
 Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that 
 (Street rules and jewels'll help teach a hungry crew) 
 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

 I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

 [Outro] 
 Yeah, yeah, foggy and shit, trees lit up everywhere 
 It's like that there, yanahmean? 
 Executive class material 
 Most official Queens representative on the motherfuckin' ji-doint 
 This is how it's goin' down 
 Sun-up to sun-down, put ya gun down[Nas (Akon)] 
 Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York 
 (Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all 
 (Uh-oh-oh, Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh) 
  
 [Ali Vegas] 
 The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail 
 Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail 
 So she tellin' me to get my CDL 
 But papi said he got some things that we could sell 
 To turn the corner and to see VVS's 
 He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses 
 You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's 
 Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh) 
 Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them 
 My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them 
 My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them 
 Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again 
 This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown 
 The big boys are back; 'lil niggas get off the playground 
 I got up with the homey A now 
 The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now 
  
 [Hook: Akon (Nas)] 
 Uh-oh-oh, we back now 
 A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now 
 When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down) 
 And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown) 
 Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town) 
 We back now (Here we go y'all) 
 A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now 
 When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down 
 (Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon) 
 And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown 
 Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go) 
  
 [Nas] 
 My man was smart 
 Robbed the bank, buried the cash 
 Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag 
 Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around 
 Young niggas not prepared this time around 
 Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor" 
 Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog 
 Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice 
 Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life? 
 The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows 
 Leavin' your soul hollow 
 That you fill it back up liquor bottles 
 Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked 
 Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks 
 They leave niggas eyes cut out; what it means to us 
 He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck 
 Black truck pull up to the door 
 Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war 
 "Get on the floor" 
  
 [Hook: Akon] 
 We back now 
 A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now 
 When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down 
 And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown 
 Uh-oh-oh 
 Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh[Intro] 
 Esco let's go 
 Esco let's go, c'mon 
 Esco let's go, let's go, let's go 
 Esco let's go, yeah, c'mon 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I used to drive in a circle before I pulled up 
 Now I just go up, they know when I got it tucked 
 Tip the door man, racist neighbors flinching 
 They don't know if I'ma rob 'em or if I'm Russell Simmons 
 They thought it was me, just like Mike Bivins 
 They pray for my downfall like the mom of Robin Givens 
 Watching how you living 
 I just wanted to roll B-L-U-N-T, and watch B-E-T 
 Picture Amerie eating Free 
 I'm trying to write hood movies, like Posse and Five Heartbeats 
 I'm all inside a dark room 
 My incense smoke took the form of ghost and it spoke 
 It said, "Nas, you the best on both coasts, you so big 
 You should write the word slave 
 On both sides of ya beards like Prince did 
 So what's this? Fuck St. Nicholas 
 You the only ghetto nigga in the hood giving gifts" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 WHAT IT IS!

 WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah 
 WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I jump in the shower, it feel like rain 
 Everybody wanna be king but can't handle the pain 
 Used to rap now they all wanna sing 
 Ask Elizabeth Taylor, when did ice turn to bling 
 She said, "Nas, it 'cause y'all rock tiny diamonds in the biggest chains 
 You the first nigga in the game that said fuck fame 
 You the 5th nigga in The Beatles 
 You the 10th nigga in the Wu-Tang, so nigga let yo' nuts hang" 
 But they can't handle it, I'm scandalous, I'm trifling 
 That's why I'm wifing 'em, quick to stick a knife in 'em 
 Catch me thinking, drinking, hurting my health 
 These women keep trying to unloosen my belt 
 Trying to get my wealth 
 I feel like Jesus with doubting Thomas', broken promises 
 I wanna walk the golden streets like where my mama is 
 But if I do what y'all want, I'll get a thousand years 
  
 [Chorus] 
 WHAT IT IS! 
 Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat) 
 Esco let's go, c'mon 
 WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!

 Esco let's go, let's go, let's go 
 WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah 
 WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Staring at the face of my watch 
 It's like a crystal ball with the ability to make the issue stall 
 I told my man duck 'cause I know where the missile fall 
 'Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich and small 
 Went to my man crib who dead and saw his picture fall 
 I picked it up his voice whispered, "nigga ball" 
 So I smoke the finest, 85 footer ocean liners 
 I do it for the have nots of mad spots 
 That resemble screensavers on your laptops 
 And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop 
 I'll be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior 
 Sip cream liqueur, green and blue Fila velour suits 
 Boss move, only thing that I endorse duke 
 Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a loss duke 
 All true and living, God, we was here first 
 Parisian linen garb and Kashmir shirts 
  
 [Chorus] 
 WHAT IT IS! 
 Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat) 
 Esco let's go, c'mon

 WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!Honies, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar 
  
 The path we all walk, starts out long it's like a boardwalk 
 Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy 
 Happy days balancing with life's atrocities 
 Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly 
  
 High up in a five realizing the price paid 
 For this life laid in the light shade 
 One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl 
 Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it 
  
 Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless 
 Pro-ball players with white wives, peep they night lives 
 While you could catch me in a crisp white five 
 Dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on, my theme song 
 Love and happiness, how can it seem wrong? 
  
 I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts 
 Now I grown up, got it chromed up 
 Got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff 
 Niggas acting cool but it's really no love 
 I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch 
  
 This is everyday, every second 
 Got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt 
 Got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt 
  
 Honies, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar 
  
 Money, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar 
  
 With so much drama in QBC 
 It's kinda hard being Escobarro 
 Elderado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle 
 My life is like a Donald Goines novel 
 We wave glasses like bravo 
  
 Drunk niggas with mad problems, and shot pockets 
 My niggas from the block rock this 
 Box cocaine, cook it and chop it 
  
 Looking to profit, in different ways 
 Goin' through this difficult stage, called life 
 But each year my physical's praised 
  
 Some fell beyond the reach of help 
 Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself 
 When all we wanted was a piece of wealth 
 And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity 
  
 Amply, living in this thug's fantasy 
 Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be 
 Heavy chain and my QB sway, living this king's life 
 Magazines write about me, in this dream it's all tight 
  
 Honies, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar 
  
 Money, cash, weed, cars 
 Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars 
 Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are 
 Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar 
  
 Now the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain 
 Iced the chain and all the followers came 
 They tried to throw me off track but I caught that 
 They thought I lost that but I'm continuing to make more stacks 
  
 Halftime, New York state of mind, it was written was hittin' 
 Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches 
 Sleepin' on the plane wake up when we land 
 Feelin' real scared, on the ground 
 Rollie flush, princess cuts, and large rounds 
  
 The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks 
 It's real, you violate, be in a pine box 
 If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy 
 I didn't make the game, the game made me 
 Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions 
 Haters keep hating, and ladies'll keep glancing 
  
 Y'all know the routine out this [Incomprehensible], word up[Intro: Nas] 
 "Represent to the fullest" 
 Let's represent forever 
 "Represent" 
 We gon represent forever 
 "Represent" 
 I will represent forever 
 "Represent" 
 Yeah, say what? 
 What you say? 
 "Represent" 
 What we do? 
 "Represent" 
 Represent 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Any day could be your last in the jungle 
 Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble 
 The corners is the hot spot, full of criminals 
 Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare 
 At the out-of-towners, they better break North 
 Before we get the four pounders and take their face off 
 The streets is filled with undercovers 
 Homicide chasing brothers 
 The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and lock us 
 And killer coppers even come through in helicopters 
 I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock 
 For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners 
 Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em 
 And leave 'em done, won't even run about 
 I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards 
 Nas is a rebel of the street corner 
 Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Represent, represent 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella 
 Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller 
 Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed 
 When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess 
 Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back 
 Love committing sins and my friends sell crack 
 This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue 
 The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one 
 ‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, crab stunts 
 So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts 
 The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator 
 The type of brother who be pissing in your elevator 
 Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game 
 Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames 
 Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs 
 Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I represent y'all 
 I represent y'all 
 I represent y'all 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 This is what it's about 
 Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan 
 Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane 
 I used to chill on the corner, on the block 
 Every day's a different...that had us running from cops 
 If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots 
 We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks 
 Nowadays, I need the cash in the hand just like the next man 
 Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand 
 Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man 
 But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam 
 Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop 
 Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow 
 Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit 
 My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it 
 It's your brain on, to all fly bitches and thugs 
 'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 I represent y'all 
 I represent y'all 
 I represent y'all 
 I represent y'all 
  
 [Outro: Nas] 
 This one goes 
 This one goes 
 To the Queen rich crew, the 40 side of Vernon 
 The 41st side of Vernon, The Goodfellas 
 My man Cee-Lo from the Don, Lakey the Kid 
 My whole crew, Big Dove 
 [?] yeah baby 
 To my whole crew from the Northside, from the Southside 
 Way out the [?] projects 
 [?] Wood 
 The whole Long Island city, we here baby (we here) 
 And of course to you D.C 
 "Represent" 
 "Represent" 
 "Represent" 
 "Represent" 
 "Represent" 
 Yeah 
 "Represent" 
 Yeah 
 "Represent" 
 Yeah 
 Oh, we represent to 
 Represent to the fullest 
 Represent to the fullest[Verse 1: Nas] 
 Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley 
 Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney 
 Brazilian candy, from Miami 
 Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion 
 Hate rap, told me where she get cake at 
 She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer 
 Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to 
 Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers 
 Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree 
 33, recovering from plastic surgery 
 Went from 34B to 36 double D 
 Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party 
 Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis 
 MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated 
 I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators 
 When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas 
 Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders 
 A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers 
 It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love 
 Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub 
 Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet 
 Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug 
 Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character 
 Taping it, Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips 
 Giving head like she knew me for years 
 Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs 
 Millions she would get if his neck got slit 
 She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me 
 Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy 
 He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport 
 Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort 
 You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear 
 Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere 
 So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping 
 Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting 
 P-11's, ACP shells for blasting 
 Caught him with his spanish maid 
 He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs 
 She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic 
 Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance 
 His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold 
 Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo 
 Twelve point five million, he kept his funds 
 In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children 
 Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision 
 All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision" 
 I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland 
 Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight 
 The same night, headed to Spain, nice game 
 Now we're back to where we meet again 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley 
 Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney 
 Top down, night air blow her hair 
 Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare 
 Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash 
 Took a blast out of her coke bag 
 Snorted it, started screaming "Yo, we almost crashed!" 
 Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass 
 Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep 
 Overwhelmed by greed, put to death[Intro] 
 So many niggas get fucked up in the game 
 See, that's where they get caught out there in that word "Game" 
 'Cause it's not no fuckin' game 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 When you hear shells coming at ya 
 Hot ones from a shotgun, I bet nigga runs faster 
 Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster 
 Think about that casket—you don't wanna be in that shit 
 Quick to take consignment; you taking everybody's package 
 Money over bitches was the law you practiced 
 So you act as if money was no object 
 Spendin' fazools, trips for your whole projects 
 Epcot Center, linens for ya bitches, Rolies for your dogs 
 Now we in the mall, slayed by his bitches 
 Every day I'm reminiscing, how he was living, having fun 
 'Cause any day coulda led to prison 
 Not for a short bid, 'cause if the feds ever caught kid 
 It'd be like 25 years conspiracy 
 Another 25 for RICO, snatching up him and his people 
 He had his jeep bulletproof, silencers on the Desert Eagle 
 Flipping bricks in Gary, Indiana 
 He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer 
 Only trusted two things: his trigger and his hammer 
 Used to be a bum 'til he had a six-month run 
 Had a lawsuit, 30 G's, the case was won 
 Met with Mexican Hoyé, cop boya 
 Bought a barbershop, named it after seeing Sade 
 That's where they found his body, in a barber chair face down 
 Bullets in his chest, sliced apart from the waist down 
 Planned to sell his shop, stick Hoyé for everything he got 
 Take jewels and his pies 
 Fill his shoes with cement and drop his body in the tides 
 But Hoyé was wise 
 Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes 
 Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Always wanted fame, always wanted cash 
 To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass 
 Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5 
 Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive 
 Always wanted fame, always wanted cash 
 To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass 
 Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5 
 Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Cokehead Sandra, she grew in Gowanus 
 Her man was large and Sandra was his baby mama 
 Stayed in drama, fighting with hood rats that he was fucking 
 No job all day, she did nothing 
 They son was 7-years-old, she really was a wifey 
 First should she would transport blow, overnight for a G 
 He paid up front, they laid up once 
 She got pregnant, she wouldn't dead it 
 She had a boy, named her son Infinite after his father who did dirt 
 She didn't know disaster would follow 
 Capsules and bottles of crack in the back of his Mazda 
 He let her drive while he drove the burgundy 5 
 He often talk about how he wants to murder these guys 
 From off of Bergen Street, had mad work in the street 
 Lifestyle, richest nigga, far from how he used to be 
 Never thought he'd rock diamonds; never took weakness for kindness 
 That's how he gradually grew 
 Did a favor for a favor—now the nigga in with the crew 
 And now he live major, house in Dix Hills next to Brooke Shields 
 With the cook and the maid, shit was real 
 Saved his first bills made in his bodega 
 "Good luck, player" sign on the paper taped in the window 
 Escaped from a would-be kidnap, and slept 
 Thought niggas feared his rep 'til he got wet 
 Woulda had the world in his hands, his girl did a scam 
 The owner's rich, is boning niggas to get rid of her man 
 Welcome to the game, baby 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Always wanted fame, always wanted cash 
 To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass 
 Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5 
 Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive 
 Always wanted fame, always wanted cash 
 To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass 
 Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5 
 Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive 
 The hardest thing to do is stay alive 
 The hardest thing to do is stay alive[Chorus: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)] 
 ("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
  
 [Verse: Nas] 
 Felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic 
 Monster Cody OG, hard as the Ramparts police 
 Warring like the Answars and Sunni 
 I never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci, and what? 
 I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke 
 The bitch you with or the reason you not broke ("Rappers!") 
 I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke 
 I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk ("Niggas!") 
 It's easy to put a gun in your throat 
 But I ain't on that, trying to sip Coladas where it's warm at 
 Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is 
 Elijah said a women half your age plus seven years 
 Is a plush way to live, this is for the blunted 
 For the niggas who keep it one hundred 
 Who hunted by DAs and judges ("Green Lantern!") 
 This is for the drunkards, stuck in the ghetto, for winos 
 And old ladies with high sugar levels 
 Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil 
 I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough ("Nas!") 
 Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil 
 I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough 
  
 [Chorus: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)] 
 ("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
 ("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga 
 Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it 
  
 [Outro: MC Ren Sample] 
 "Why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me? 
 Because police always wanna harass me!" 
  
 [Interlude: Sample Collage] 
 "This is once again proof that no routine police stop is actually routine. We saw that last week, of course, in Brooklyn, with the tragedy over there, and then again last night, another police shooting." 
 "Here's what they think about you!" 
 "I hate motherfuckers like you. You niggas ain't shit! Think you tough, huh? I could blow your head off with the Smith and Wesson and you couldn't do shit! How you feel now?"Situations I be kicking just you get you pacing 
 That attentive, parental supervision, you should do the diction 
 Street chronicles, struggles and losses 
 Can make a nigga's moms hang up crosses and horseshoes 
 I brought you, to that state of mind you needed 
 By now your weeded, bob your head, recline seated 
 And put your life inside the shoes of the shiestiest crews 
 With sports cars and the iciest jewels, y'all know the rules 
 In this street life, by now the beasts might be least white 
 Stash your heat right, my pop passed the peace pipe 
 And shed light on, he put me right on 
 To be an icon, cuz dead niggas got they name wrote up in krylon 
 The fast life, fistfights that shit could like amuse me 
 Some chose a road some niggas died so what's to choosing? 
 At nighttime, it especially addresses me 
 Preferably, around 10, when my weed cipher begin 
 We start bugging on facts, half the facts that's for sure 
 Put your zone in my world if we adapt, crack, and pour 
 Make a toast yo that's how we break bread together 
 Probably when we dead be better, the problems ahead whatever 
 Courvoisier sipping, whipping' out-of-state missions 
 And just in case you're snitching, the safe's hidden 
 With these conniving things, niggas make it to obvs (obvious) to bring 
 Hatred to enterprising cream, advise your team to wiser schemesAlchemist you know me man 
 I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio 
 Soon as I hear the track, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today 
  
 Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man 
 I don't even remember when I was writing these shits 
 Oor what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man 
 Fuck it check it 
  
 How can I trust you when I can't trust me? 
 Picture myself a old man a O.G 
 Some niggas will conversate with lairs all day time pass 
 (Nah lemme start somethin' else) 
  
 Soul on ice death threats given by clowns 
 I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns 
 I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first I thought I was abnormal 
 'Cause I would overcome any tasked called to 
  
 So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain 
 Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game 
 Ya rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue" 
 It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue 
  
 Rarely y'all come in contact with the real 
 Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel 
 Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life 
 Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes 
  
 Oh shit Tina, I been lookin' for this bitch number damn 
 No this rhyme is weak, this is week I remember this bullshit right here 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Gandhi was a what the fuck? 
  
 Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death 
 The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest 
 (I wonder when I wrote this, nah it's weak) 
 The money's ya religion sky the limit live life 
 Numbers is big business makes the poor live strife 
  
 The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream 
 Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king 
 Pimps and card sharks 
 Thieves murderers with hard luck 
  
 Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society 
 Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety 
 Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms 
 Beautiful ladies on their arms 
  
 Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas 
 Rubbing my lips with Campophenique 
 Still behind the ears wet turned out to be 
 Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and lairs and squares 
 (Nah that was weak there) 
  
 My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale 
 Pardon me type in my two way while I'm chargin' my cell 
 It's hard to be iced up with Gucci 
 God poverty's real I can't fight you 
 'Cause you would sue me niggas be groupies 
  
 I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style 
 And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit 
 I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie 
 My Nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be 
 My book of rhymes 
  
 This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist? 
 Huh you a funny nigga, naw yeah 
 (My book of rhymes) 
  
 I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now 
 Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that 
 I musta been high on some shit 
 Mmm what the fuck is this? 
  
 Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood 
 Our values so low our values are no good 
 Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded 
 'Cause now we need it, we older almost able t 
  
 I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful? 
 Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit 
 Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way 
 Such a innocent child is what some say 
  
 I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are 
 Like a star not a worry in this world thus far 
 But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention 
 I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant 
 (Kinda crazy)[Spoken: Nas] 
 Thank you, for giving me 20 years 
 Thank you, thank you 
 So, we now conclude with the final song of Illmatic 
 This one is the end of the cassette 
 It was just 9 songs 
 Yeah, this song right here, I got you though 
 This one my joint 'cause I'm a big Michael Jackson fan and he 
 I'll tell you something that I never said 
 For my album cover, you see me with the afro, that was kinda inspired by Michael Jackson, the little, the little kid picture, right? 
 So, I never told that anyone before 
 So, this is uhh, "It Ain't Hard To Tell" 
 The sample's from "Human Nature" 
 Yeah, I see y'all right here 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 The mic is contacted 
 My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath 
 I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps 
 Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond 
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my 
 Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion! 
 Nas is like the 
 ‘Cause in my physical I can express through song 
 Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong 
 I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell 
 From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 Some of y'all was like 5 years old when this album came out 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up 
 Not stories by Aesop 
 Place your loot up, parties I shoot up 
 Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L 
 School a fool well, you feel it like Braille 
 It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill 
 Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic 
 I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik 
 Jam like a TEC with correct techniques 
 So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me 
 Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me 
 I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose 
 Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell 
 Yeah, yeah 
  
 [Interlude: Nas] 
 If you was there with me in '94, make some noise 
 I love you for that 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 This rhythmatic explosion 
 Is what your frame of mind has chosen 
 I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen 
 Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin 
 End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again 
 Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop 
 I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles 
 Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle 
 And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova 
 You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra 
 Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot 
 Vocals will squeeze Glocks 
 MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak 
 My poetry's deep, I never fell 
 Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 It ain't hard to tell 
  
 [Nas] 
 20 years, yes

 You only get 1 shot to make a first impression. There ain't no such thing as second chances in this game. It only takes 1 man to knock you out the box. It only takes 1 woman to drive you insane. It only took 1 sniff now look Im addicted. It took 1 bad decision. Now my whole life is shifted. It only took 1 shot to kill my best friend. It only took 1 Glock for me to get revenge. It only takes 1 pill just to ease the pain. It only takes 1 bullet to end everything. Right here and right now. ‘cause of sick of all of it. The 1 times. The jakes and the fakes. Sick of all of them.

 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime 
 Since the blackout in Queensbridge in '79 
 Everybody's a killer now; pimps, playas, and dons 
 Shorties on the block push drops and carry on 
 Niggas look through our window wherever we drove 
 Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes 
 We the Queens kings, I used to view the cats that are old 
 Seeing things that made me real from my skin to my soul 
 Girls who turned hoes, friends who turned foes 
 Bad luck niggas who bring death wherever they go 
 Never sleep, it feels better to know 
 It's all real though 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Everything is real 
 Where we Headed now? 
 Up to more money, would be more fun 
 Leave with mo' bitches, carry more guns 
 Where we headed now? Where we going, yo? 
 It's getting real, son; we gon' let it flow 
 Where we Mo' bitches, it be more dough 
 It be more fun, holding more... 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 How the hell are we supposed to excel from the street 
 Where the Jake's crew face young kids who wanna eat? 
 Quantum Leap to this Black world, hustlers and ghettos 
 Self-made millionaires who tussle with the devil 
 Bust a lil metal lead, wrestle you, to the pebbles 
 On the hard ground, that's if your guard down 
 It's a struggle, brothers jump bail 
 To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale 
 On the horn with the god Shapelle, my Queens comrade 
 Yo, run and come in with the dime bag 
  
 [Verse 3: Shapelle] 
 Ayo, I need dat, I got to smoke dat 
 Send me some Chunky Black, so I could smoke away the pain 
 Try to find my brain, but the thought still remain 
 Yo, it's on again once the death stunts these chains 
 'Cause I been through it; the drug game, I thought I knew it 
 I got knocked, took it to trial, but I blew it 
 25, but only lived 20 years of my life 
 Took 5 from me; got me wrapped up like a mummy 
 Now I'm in the system a.k.a. the devil's home 
 Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone 
 Now I'm living with, drug dealers, and chain stealers 
 Bitch niggas who got knocked and turned squealers 
 Imagine, sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict 
 Who love fucking with faggots, but I civilized the savage 
 I sat him down and made him study mathematics 
 Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking... 
 About this reefer I'ma get this weekend 
 On the V.I., I rather be... uh, damn, damn[Intro] 
 Turn your radios up 
 The real niggas are back on the radio

 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute my "Niggas!") 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute) 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin' 
 No disrespect to Islam, no Imam or Pastor 
 No answers to questions the media's askin' 
 Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists? 
 They love it; puttin old niggas verse the youngest 
 Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas 
 There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas 
 Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas 
 Not mad cause Eminem said nigga, cause he my nigga 
 Wigga, cracker, friend, we all black within, okay? 
 We all African, okay, some Africans don't like us no-way 
 A killing happened in Johannesburg yesterday 
 Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked 
 Some say N-double A-C-P, keep us sidetracked 
 But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins 
 Faster cars than NAS-a-CARs and, sparkin while ridin 
 Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich 
 With this N-word jargon I'm just starting, bitch! 
  
 [Hook: Dante Hawkins (Nas)] 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute my "Niggas!") 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute) 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet 
 Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with 
 Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you 
 If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'mma get you 
 I'm official, not a-tisket or a-tasket 
 I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet 
 They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed 
 Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up 
 I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who he hatin us? 
 I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust 
 Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers 
 I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters 
 Clique still movin' like Freemasons, so if I'm on the flow 
 From the law, there's lodges all across the nation 
 Nas is bred for the plan 
 To hold the Grand Dragon's head in my hand 
 Come and get me, here I am 
  
 [Hook: Dante Hawkins (Nas)] 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute my "Niggas!") 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
 This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas (So I salute my "Niggas!")[Intro:] 
 Uhh, Uhh, Where am I going? 
 Where am I? Yo, it's ill 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo my wife's tired of fucking me 
 Life tries ducking me 
 Luckily I find 'em just at the right time 
 Mac in my right arm, Tequila bottle in 
 My left arm like Cristian 
 Watching my life go, Can´t do myself in 
 Wolves in the night yo, hells men 
 Two revolvers I can let twelve spin 
 Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit 
 Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well 
 Twisted blunts and inner conscience 
 Telling me that I ain't shit 
 No matter how much cash I sit with 
 Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness 
 My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain 
 To replenish my adolescent brain 
 Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane 
 So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain 
 I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets 
 Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat 
 Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive 
 As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is 
 To maintain, bitches playin' games 
 Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names 
 But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang 
 Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed 
 I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash 
 Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me 
 Instead they speed ahead 
 Yo nigga watch me 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
 I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
 I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to 
 Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
 Steering wheel in my hand 
 Trying to hold it steady 
 Anything in my way is dead 
 Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
 When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone 
 Drunk by myself 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once 
 Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts 
 For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves 
 Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well 
 Take them to hell 
 Stick up niggas once ran up on me 
 My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me 
 I ain't your mark homey 
 It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake 
 Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes 
 Could hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision 
 Think about the time in my life before I was in televison 
 Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision 
 Since we all hood niggas expect kilos 
 For what they not seeing is police expect Rico 
 Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated 
 Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me 
 I hate it when I'm like this 
 The bottle's my accomplice 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The reason that I want to be alone 
 Tired of all the things that went wrong 
 That would have went right if I would have did it on my own 
 Take another swigg 
 The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts 
 Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down 
 Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through 
 Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true 
 Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately 
 Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again 
 To keep my mind off that weak shit 
 There's love through it all, things to live for 
 I swerve, almost crash into a wall 
 Think about the good, find myself laughing 
 Turn the cell off, no way to be reached 
 Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets 
 Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home 
 Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip 
 Bring my ass to the crib 
 I'm tired... 
  
 [Hook][INTRO: ALL] 
 1,2, Eye for an eye we in this together 
 Son your beef is mine So long as the sun shines to light up the sky 
 We in this together son your beef is mines 
  
 [Verse 1: Raekwon] 
  
 Ayo,ayo,ayo, my thug related style attract millions 
 Fans, they understand my plan 
 Who's the kid up in the green Land? 
 Then I skate motivate gettin' (Sniff) 
 Lifted, me and my chick get eight 
 Now im coolin' with the clique Mobb Deep and 
 Nas, word up here's the first prize I generate 
 Off the head piece, freestyle session word up son 
  
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
  
 Check it out yo,To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil 
 In the categories of stories I breed my sequel 
 You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's 
 Monkey see, monkey do shorty sipping sunny dew 
 On a low like a ????? o,chill shades of flow 
 Big Havoc at like you know, kid 
  
  
 [Verse 3: Prodigy] 
  
 Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me 
 You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me 
 Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12, 
 Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search 
 I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9 
 It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time 
 Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son 
 D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns," 
 So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking 
 Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion 
 Hold myself down the only way I know 
 Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe 
 Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow 
 The maximum is death son you know how that go(feat. Ludacris & Doug E. Fresh)

 Bling! A little cute thing said, "What's yo' name?" 
 I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain 
 Oooh ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up 
 BLAOW! Ludacris in the ho-oooh-ouse 
 The needle hit the record, they was playin this song 
 All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON 
 Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance 
 While I'm laid back chillin in my b-boy stance 
 Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's top droppin 
 But watch for cockblockin on my coochie stock options 
 But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track 
 Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that 
 Honey in the black cause I'm feelin her curves 
 He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD 
 Why only serve one when we can serve up two 
 Then at the bachelor's pad, doin what the Virgos do 
 And these women so shy but get loud undercover 
 So we can have sex but I CAN'T BE YOUR LOVERRRRRRRRRRR

 Let's go (let's go) it's the Virgo 
 Let's go (Nasty Nas) let's go (Ludacris) 
 And if you don't know, now you know - Doug E. Fresh[Verse 1] 
  
 Heard ya got your masters 
 Did college up 
 Never look back 
 Now that's what's happenin' 
 And it's good to see you made it out the hood with a degree a true man with passion 
 Now you can enter the so called white man's society and go right past them 
 Lookin' in the wall street journal for your face but it's always absent 
 Everyday that's him eatin' flan and ambrosia his watch on his arm golden, Latin 
 Try to get his attention but he's flinching very close(unknown) so I mention 
 We was neighbors some time ago 
 He was kinda cold 
 In this restaurant full of his kind and mold 
 He sighed and tried to look surprised I know 
 This side of the city where he resides so 
 I had to go 
 I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes 
 Hate so called intellectuals no balls and suggest we vote 
 He stand all proud speakin' to correct his folks 
 Suggest that we don't sell dope but I guess it's true but who the fuck are you 
  
 [Hook] 
 Who are you trying to tell me who I am 
 Trying to tell me who I am 
 Who are you trying to tell me what I'm not 
 Tryin' to tell me what I'm not 
 Who are you trying to tell me who I am 
 Tryin' to box me in tryin' to find who I am 
  
  
 [Verse 2] 
  
 I'm Idi Amin 
 I'm Marcus Garvey 
 8 Track Brown 
 I'm Muhammad Ali 
 I'm Reginald Lewis 
 George Washington Carver 
 I'm Nas with incredible music 
 Let's do this 
 Thinkin' of a Master Plan 
 Sippin' on Disasters 
 Smokin' on Gangsta 
 Watchin' niggas argue chillin' on my bar stool 
 With my hell up in Harlem, hat in hand, with a girl named Pat 
 She more than the waitress you order your drink with 
 She's divorced the banker and bought the bar 
 She got an automobile 
 She give her order to kill 
 You get caught and robbed 
 You can see your walk is off you can lose your rhythm when your out in the gutter for awhile 
 You easily go from soft to hard 
 Now it's all about hustlers, number runners, ho's, and sharks 
 And we all know the code of the block 
 And you're talkin' some gibberish, some anti nigga shit cause you marched back with Rosa Parks 
 Brother don't start 
 Go build your Noah's Ark 
 You can float to the end of the world then pretend what you're not 
 But I know what you are 
 While I roll in my car 
 While I'm spinnin' my knot 
 While our enemies plot you ain't outta the shot 
 Matter of fact you are an easier target 
 And I respect everything you accomplished, but hope that I never get old and talk that nonsense 
 So who the fuck are you

 Why can't you tell 
 Why can't you tell[Intro: Nas] 
 Nasty Nas in your area 
 About to cause mass hysteria 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Before a blunt, I take out my fronts 
 Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt 
 You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer 
 That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever 
 King poetic; too much flavor, I'm major 
 Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number, like a pager 
 ‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass 
 40-side is the place that is giving me grace 
 Now wait, another dose and you might be dead 
 And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds 
 And ain't a damn thing gonna change 
 I'm a performer, strange 
 So the mic warmer was born to gain 
 Nas, why did you do it? You know 
 You got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme; it's halftime 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Halftime 
 Halftime 
 Halftime 
 Yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's like that, you know it's like that 
 I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back 
 When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back 
 So I react never calmly on a hype track 
 I set it off with my own rhyme 
 ‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time 
 I'm max like, I flex like sex 
 In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck 
 I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive 
 When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5 
 I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it 
 With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach 
 Nasty Nas has to rise, ‘cause I'm wise 
 This is exercise 'til the microphone dies 
 Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin' 
 But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks, and 
 Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand 
 And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man 
 I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships 
 I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips 
 I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic 
 Rest in peace Mr. Magic, tragic 
 I'm an intellectual 
 And that's no question, yo 
 These are the lyrics of the man 
 You can't near it, understand? 
 ‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known, like the number man 
 Am I in place with the bass and all that? 
 Explore rap and tell me, "Nas ain't all that." 
 And next time I rhyme, I be foul 
 Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild 
 I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme 
 Stay tuned, I assume; the real rap comes at halftime 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Check check, it's halftime 
 Looking at my Rollie, it's that time, oh 
 Yeah, that's [?] over there 
 But some of y'all know 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I got it going on, even flip a morning song 
 Every afternoon, I kick half the tune 
 And in the darkness, I'm heartless, like when the NARC's hit 
 Word to Marcus Garvey; I hardly sparked it 
 ‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word 
 I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third 
 But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay 
 I bag bitches up at, and hit a matinee 
 Putting hits on 5-0 
 ‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44 
 And biters can't come near 
 And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia 
 I won't plant seeds 
 Don't need an extra mouth I can't feed 
 That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed 
 This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten 
 Brooklyn and Queens is living fat, and 
 The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout 
 Ill Will, rest in peace! We was out 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 Halftime 
 Whole up, looking at my Rollie, it's that time, oh 
 Half—half—it's halftime 
 Yeah, check, hey yo, it's halftime 
 Not even half of this show though 
 Not even half, yeah 
 Halftime, yeah 
 Halftime, yeah 
 Halftime 
  
 [Spoken: Nas] 
 Y'all alright over here? Over here?[Intro] 
 What you say? Can't hear you, man, speak the fuck up 
 (It's what they want) Word (It's what they want) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep 
 Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip 
 Gold on my neck was once a code of respect 
 For high rollers and vets 
 Now it's loads of baguettes 
 Prefer a Mac-10 over a Tec 
 No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets 
 Trees that might eject my hype back 
 Famous phrase "Nigga, light that" 
 Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?' 
 It's all about Playboys when we was young 
 Could only get tongue, then finally we could cum 
 Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's 
 Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro 
 From bottles, to seven in your hand 
 To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can 
 Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it 
 We got it if the fiends want it 
 The whole block singing the same theme "Don it" 
 Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket 
 If it's ice work, I'm gon' truck it 
 You gotta love it, you gotta love it 
  
 [Hook] 
 (It's what they want) Fuck it, you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want, huh? It's what they want) 
 Fuck it, you gotta love it 
 (It's what they want, huh?) Fuck it, you gotta love it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist 
 Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches 
 Hunger my riches, her childish wishes 
 Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes 
 Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough 
 Kicking this flow, slip and you fold 
 So when your clique roll, I let my clips go 
 Niggas on opposite poles 
 I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole 
 Inhumane, living hostile opposed 
 To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes 
 Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in Suburbans with liquor 
 Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas 
 See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference 
 Coke sniffing, tapping 13-year-old chickens 
 You can't be a kingpin when you snitching 
 Regardless, we still make you a target 
 We shoot you in jail, chrome objects 
 Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics 
 This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics 
 Miserable cats, hunger paining 
 Get off your ass, stop complaining 
 My crew be in Montego Bay Macarena-ing 
 Marinating, while you home, waiting your arraignment 
 This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 
 Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me 
 They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me 
 You gotta love it 
  
 [Hook] 
 Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?) 
 Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want) 
 Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?) 
 (It's what they want...it's what they want)He's a kaleidoscope to look in; a black men and white women 
 Sometimes together make exotic looking children 
 But mixed race kids become fixated on separating themselves from the hatred 
 Your grandma on the black side make you slam the station 
 Your grandma on the white side was educated in schools that were segregated; maybe she was racist 
 Maybe you can't, today, school her on some brand new today shit 
 If I grew up a rich boy, like this boy, this white boy, like you boy, the Christmas toys, the privileged joys 
 I think I'd be less stressed, the whole family at home, the ideal address 
 But he's dealing with self mutilation, dungeons and dragons, Ouija boards, rituals with satan 
 Yeah, we grew up with similar anger[Verse 1: Nas] 
 It's the late night greasy spoon patron 
 Poolhall making 
 Big bets, midsection got the 8 in 
 Dior Christian pimpin' 
 Got that penal system diction 
 Riffing, you don't want it you snitchin' 
 Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR 
 Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat 
 Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black 
 Bitches want my chipped tooth back 
 Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked 
 Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip 
 From the paparazzi 
 Still playing numbers you can't stop me 
 Still wearing bundles, and spark weed 
 If I ever say "Queens get 'em", you know they got me 
 Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef 
 So lead by example, or get trampled 
 Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the N 
 Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again

 Don't hate me now, congratulate me now 
 I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe 
 Don't hate me now, congratulate me now

 Stay splifted 'cause you know that I love the dro

 Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns 
 Don't make me grab your only son 
 I'm coming from 
 A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape 
 From phonies who hate

 That's why the god party with juicy models 
 They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano - hardly

 Roll to every station, murder the DJ 
 Roll to every station, murder the DJ 
 Hip hop just died this mornin' 
 And she's dead, she's dead 
 Yeah, niggas smoke, laugh, party, and die in the same corner 
 Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama

 Any ghetto will tell ya Nas helped grow us up 
 My face once graced promotional Sony trucks 
 Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up 
 Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left 
 So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def 
 So, nigga, who's your top ten? 
 Is it MC Shan? 
 Is it MC Ren?

 Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin' 
 What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings 
 Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings 
 Criticize that, why is that? 
 'Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap 
 'Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin' 
 Most intellectuals will only half listen 
 So you can't blame jazz musicians 
 Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues 
 Oh, I they like me in my white tee 
 You can't ice me, we here for life, B 
 On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey 
 And for that we not takin' it lightly 
 If hip hop should die, we die together

 Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business 
 If it got where it started

 One homeboy became a man then a mobster 
 If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka 
 R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a Rasta 
 Went from turntables to mp3s 
 From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's 
 From gold cables to Jacobs 
 From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

 It's about eighty niggas from my hood that showed up 
 And they came to show love 
 Sold out concert, and the doors are closed shut[Intro] 
 The world is yours is something is, um, something I got from Slick Rick 
 Back in the days, hey young world, the world is yours 
 From the movie Scarface where, uh, his whole thing was the world is yours 
 He sort of bluntly said the world is yours out there in the sky 
 He looked at it, uh, something from god telling him, you know, the world is yours 
  
 Yeah, yeah, yeah (It goes) 
  
 [Chorus: x2] 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Young world young world... the world is yours 
 Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)

 Young people are so special 
 It's so good what god blessed you 
 Death to unethical thoughts that surpress you 
 Like diseases, they conjure up inside the test tubes 
 To stress you, beaurcratic genocide 
 But maybe I'm a wreck loose 
 It's just my observation as a whole 
 Human extermination, population control 
 Assuming my generation is young and out of control 
 But y'all don't understand this 
 Y'all out of touch and y'all old 
 I promise to stay in full, try to stay on course 
 And right the wrongs of my father with my baby boy 
 Life is full of problems, don't go away when ignored 
 Life is long it's important that it's played like a sport 
 Every skyscraper you see started off as a thought 
 And Ricky Walters told me that the world could be yours 
 So hey young world, yeah hey young world 
 The world is yours 
  
 [Chorus: x2] 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Young world young world... the world is yours 
 Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You could have been arrested 
 Locked down doing 10 on a fed bid 
 But you home so your know you blessed, kid 
 But trust me, I know some people who are not as lucky 
 Cause on the small drug beef 
 Gone 15 years it must be 
 Conspiracy, a killer sees 
 No liberty or justice 
 Congress talk nonsense 
 It's consignment for us hustlers 
 There's no 401k retirement for us hustlers 
 It's one way, until death 
 We die young, it's bum luck 
 Young bruh, tell me why you want war? 
 Tote a gun for, whoever to pump forth 
 With tough talk, get done off 
 New York City streets they carry the worst gun law 
 But still it's real, we do it with tools 
 It's ungod, under the code of hood, play your role 
 And maybe you'll live to grow old 
 Kids and a wife and household 
 Slow your roll before your soul 
 Eject from your body and you turn cold 
 Take advice yo, take a higher road 
 Hey young world, yeah, hey young world, yeah (It goes) 
  
 [Chorus: x2] 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Hey young world... the world is yours 
 Young world young world... the world is yours 
 Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)Uhh, oooooooooooooh baby, baby 
 Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah 
  
 [Nas] 
 Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me 
 I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me 
 For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid 
 Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful 
 First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe) 
 Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable 
 Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do 
 But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha) 
 I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth 
 From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches 
 Can't keep they hands to theyself no more 
 I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch 
 You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down 
 So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony 
 You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only 
 But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak 
 You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day 
 But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson 
 Concernin this mic profession, turn your direction 
  
 [Nas] 
 You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy 
 It's childish; should I have to resort to violence? 
 Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album 
 And show you how to stay off my dick 
 That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man 
 When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans 
 No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection 
 You unlucky, I'm your fuckin C-section 
 Plus I'm the last real nigga alive 
 Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high 
  
 Realize, how many classics I gave you 
 Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [Nas] 
 You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line 
 Why they tryin to take mine? I'm past +8 Miles+ of every state line 
 Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts 
 At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch 
 As real millionaire, shit'll take place 
 Evil as Hitler's hate-race people 
 This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace 
 To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan 
 Is not to destroy your man 
 But to bring more to mankind and teach 
 Every MC reach for your pens and papers 
 Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior? 
 Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand 
 And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that 
 And you my offspring, the boss sting 
 A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that 
 Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at? 
 Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me 
 If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in 
 What the fuck was you niggas thinkin? 
 Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin that you comin for the kingpin 
 But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha 
 Take me out, try try try, but you 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You can't be me[Intro: Nas] 
 INVASION! 
  
 [Spoken: Samples] 
 “Watch closely. You are about to experience a ‘nigga moment.’ Webster defines the ‘nigga moment’ as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind of an otherwise logical Negro man.” 
  
 “What did you say, bitch nigga?” 
  
 “Die, nigga! *gunshot*” 
  
 “Brothers and sisters using the word nigga…” 
  
 “Nigga, nigga, nigga…” 
  
 “HE’S A NIGGER! HE’S A NIGGER!” 
  
 “I ain’t no nigga!” 
  
 “What kind of message are you hoping to send with— with that new album?” 
  
 “FUCK THE NIGGERS! (Oh, my God!)” 
  
 “A NIGGER, LOOK! IT’S A NIGGER!” 
  
 “How you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?” 
  
 “Flatline!” 
  
 “There goes the neighborhood!”[nature] 
 Do you see what I see? 
 Do you smoke what I smoke? 
 Do you wanna smoke? 
 Do you wanna ride? 
  
 Yeah aiyyo aiyyo 
 When I walk into a room, niggas feel a slight breeze 
 Stay a little while till they feel they might freeze 
 Never understood why they never liked me 
 'cause when I locked the door, they turned into to icees 
 Starin at my feet all you see is nikes 
 Bet you never seen a ill pair like these 
 Size ten, never find me in a tight squeeze 
 At the airport, minutes before my flight leaves 
 Round trip tickets to who knows where 
 Stay boarding, never at least a day's warning 
 Previous plans, they spoiling 
 A dollar and a dream, the theme to new york, stay torrance 
 From st. john's to wake forest, wait for us 
 Straight ballers, you hearin it first 
 Nate flawless in almost every event 
 Puttin up point, while niggas like y'all stay scoreless 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All my niggas from the projects, light one up 
 To my bitches from the projects, light one up 
 And stay high, high 
 And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high) 
 We on some hood shit (so high) 
 Niggas from the projects, light one up 
 To my bitches from the projects, light one up 
 And stay high, high 
 And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high) 
 We on some hood shit (so high) 
  
 [nas] 
 What's me without the hood? 
 A tree without wood, a dutch wit no bud 
 A cut wit no blood 
 A fuck but don't nut, I be incomplete 
 If me and the street wasn't in between the sheets 
 I'm a product of hard luck, the money and murder game 
 Here's nature, kill a faker, man you heard of the name 
 From the cold streets of qb, old beef to new beef 
 No peace, through the song, what I see you see 
  
 [nature] 
 Mad bitches wanna smoke wit me 
 Niggas wanna roll wit me 
 Usually in my hood, find me in yo' city 
 Grimy-ette so pretty, it's like there's two me's 
 Wit no favorites, I try to love both of me 
 Thinkin of a way where I can better myself 
 Sometimes I get a head of myself 
 Holdin weed wit intention, frontin like I got it prescribed 
 So high I must be outta my mind 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [nature] 
 It's like hoppin in a glass pool, half full 
 Niggas only hit the bottom when they crash through 
 Mash fools out like they fast food 
 Bon' appetit, platinum or not, it ain't no match for me 
 I sum niggas whole careers up, scared tough niggas 
 Bluff niggas into thinkin that their year's up 
 It ain't a game, took six months off, the shit jumps off 
 Mini-me's are gettin punched in they jaw 
 My dunn call this shit animal rap 
 Me, I call it dumbin 
 My near-sighted niggas saw it comin 
 More stunnin, brand new flows to toy wit 
 Neck flooded on some hurricane floyd shit 
 Back and forth to st. crouix kid, same plan 
 Playin sega dreamcast till the plane lands 
 A changed man, niggas don't know, they never will 
 And if they don't understand, then they ain't fam, simple as that 
  
 Chorus 2x[Intro: Nas]

 It's Illmatic

 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha 
 Get my crew to buy beers 
 And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh 
 Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly 
 Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies 
 After being blessed by the herb's essence 
 I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds 
 That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin' 
 Keep lubrication, Magnum protection 
 Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly 
 Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G 
 I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll 
 Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella 
 Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops 
 Rip in peace to my mom dukes 
 When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop 
 Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 You know the hard times, kid 
 Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid 
 But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme 
 Muslims yelling "Free the mind" 
 And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places 
 As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us 
 But now I know the time, got a older mind 
 Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine 
 I'm new on the rap scene, niggas never heard of me 
 Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me 
 Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker 
 My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers 
 Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates 
 Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate 
 Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot 
 And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot 
 The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa 
 I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car 
 From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God 
 I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job 
 See, my brain is incarcerated 
 Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided 
 I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend 
 I contact eleven L's and max in heaven 
  
 [Chorus: Nas] 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 Yeah, whatever 
 One time for your mind, one time

 One time for your mind, one time 
 One time for your mind, one time 
 One time for your mind, one timeAy yo..you... You that just flipped on this C.D. player: 
 I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good, you hold on to 'em 
  
 Must be nice... having someone who understands the life you live 
 Must be nice... having someone who's slow to take and quick to give 
 Must be nice... having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick 
 Someone who smiles bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion 
  
 Must be nice...having someone who loves you despite your faults 
 Must be nice...having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk 
 Must be nice...having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too 
  
 Someone who loves you fa sho 
 You must remember to never let 'em go 
  
 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone 
 She'll be by your side, still holding on 
 Even when those twenties stop spinning 
 And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here 
  
 Must be nice... having someone you could come home to from a long day of work 
 Must be nice... having someone you don't have to show; 
 They know exactly where it hurts 
 Must be nice... having someone who trusts you... 
 Despite what they've heard 
 Someone as mighty as a lion, but still gentle as a bluebird 
  
 Must be nice... having someone you don't have to tell you don't wanna be wrong 
 Must be nice... having someone you can grow old with until God calls you home 
 Must be nice... having someone who understands that a thug has feelings, too 
 Someone that loves you fa sho, you never let em go! 
  
 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone 
 She'll be by your side, still holding on 
 Even when those twenties stop spinning (And they will stop one day) 
 And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here 
  
 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone 
 She'll be by your side, still holding on 
 Even when those twenties stop spinning 
 And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here 
  
 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone 
 She'll be by your side, still holding on 
 Even when those twenties stop spinning

 Play your position focus on life, see what you're missing 
 Reality, the tale or the caliber 
 .45-Nickel-9. check the calender 
 '97m deep algebra, black plaga 
 Rule the world high, ___ 
 With my gangster for single years 
 And rap world emulates my life for years 
 Autobiography a part of me 
 Portaits of the ill shit inside of me 
 Magnetic, jigged up to my faded wig 
 Any position I'm in, I find a way to live 
 Out of state, on the block or behind metal gate 
 Yo, this heavyweight got cheddar to make 
 Smack your head off, click wildling, push through 
 Puerto rock warriors too you through 
 The drama 
 Escobar or Pablo, Miliano, Pabo; take the world pronto 
 Word to mine, genuine, Señor Juan at your table 
 Poision you, mad fatal 
 Just the way it is, when you let the hood raise you 
 Never let them hoes play you 
 Mental, smart, strong and stableY'all know what it is 
 The streets named me Illmatic, for that I'm still at it 
 Can't hate us 
 Fellas 
  
 Vice behind me on the intersection 
 Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection 
 Dress superb, admired by conspirers 
 Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up 
 Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy 
 Complain about labour pains, nigga show me the baby 
 And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle 
 Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles 
 Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin' 
 Witnessin' you rockin' with Nas, confirmed my suspicion 
 Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em 
 I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it 
 And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich 
 And still I don't abort 'em ? when and if they sink quick 
 Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge 
 And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live 
  
 I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze 
  
 'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin' 
 While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin' 
 To every nigga listenin' 
 I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening 
 And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole 
 Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble 
 15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo' 
 Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle 
 I rekindled the flame 
 Dre created The Game 
 Nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came 
 Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain 
 Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted 
 I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it 
 Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it 
 Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, nigga 
  
 Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me 
 How you gon' pass the dutchie ? to them niggas that don't love me 
 I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top 
 Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not 
 I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins 
 Dre took my training wheels off his curtains 
 I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers 
 The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career 
 The ending of yours, the endin' of his 
 Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz 
 Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line 
 Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines 
 And I still think about my nigga from time to time 
 Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind 
 But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that 
 He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin' off rap 
 One love 
  
 I'll do Marsha's bit if you want, but it seems kinda pointless 
 I thought Nas was on point with his multis, the cotton line is a bit old thoughSend* corrections to the typist [Swizz

 The Price i Pay To See My Son. And apologies in advance for the typos as I am speaking from the heart as a man who has had enough. 
 Today i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this. 
 This is what your life has come to sis? 
 Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain...just to get at me....to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even a issue for me to have time with my son. A son needs his father. So many absentee fathers out here and here i am being attacked by your accusations simply because i got us in court to help fix this the custody matter? 
 Why did i have to take you to court to see our son? Why when i win the joint custody ( which is a win for both of us and our son, it helps us with both our schedules) why do you feel thats an attack on you? Is it control ? Why do you need to have control over my life? because we’re not together? Then why? Is this being rewarded and praised by people who are being taken advantage of by you and your lies? 
 To all separated couples out there who are cordial and co parent nicely GOOD FOR YOU. I wish that was me. I’m the most chill cool parent there is. Who has time to argue ? About what? It’s about our little guy. You haven’t had to deal with what I’ve been dealing with. Trust me. 
 I’m a mild mannered god fearing very fair human being who tries his hardest to please everyone. It’s my nature. 
 I’ve seen this too many times before 
 And there was times i thought Kelis my ex wife was not this type. This is the type of antics that deceive people and people mistakenly call it strong. Seems I always had more belief in you than you do for yourself. I instilled strength in my daughter who you were already so jealous of and treated poorly. Being jealous & verbally abusive to a Little girl. 
  
 [Part 2:] 
 In life you have to work hard to be successful, not try to tear someone down for that’s the most coward way. Women are the essence of life. I cherish them. My strength is given to me from my mother. I am everything she taught me to be. I was raised in a single home by a single woman. I am a very proud black man. 
 I shouldn’t have ignored the signs from your your first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. But I thought you was beautiful. You came into my life at a time i was grieving from my moms passing. You was a friend. Because of that i wanted to marry you. And i did. And we had a big lavish wedding. Overall there was too many good times. I have to say i wasn’t the most faithful husband. I was immature. I’m sorry about that. But you bumped your own head sis. 
 Why do i have to live thru a constant divorce? It didn’t work out. Life goes on. I’m not coming back to you. Your married and im happy for you and I’m a extremely happy black brother out here trying to make a difference for my kids and the next generation of young people who see me as huge inspiration in music, art,business, education and so on. 
 After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son’s entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do? 
  
 [Part 3:] 
 There’s some seriously crazy things i won’t i disclose for our son’s sake. 
 Because you keep my son from me ive been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit I’m tired of it. I’m tired of you painting a bad picture of me. I’ve been tired of it but you never seem to get tired. 
 I even had to be in a relationship with you AGAIN after we separated just so i could see my son & I AM JUST TIRED. 
 Back then you asked me why didn’t i stop the divorce from happening. I tried! We are too different. Some things aren’t meant to be. We were meant to be so that we could have our son. Nothing more. You didn’t like that. I prayed for your peace of mind for years because of your uneasy soul. I still do. I guess some things take time. You definitely don’t know me now and probably never knew me. You make up this image of me that’s not true but it’s funny because it’s really you describing yourself. You made up stories about me and claimed i did things that YOU DID. 
 I hate all this, but you were a very jealous wife, and i had to deal with that and that’s the worst feeling. How much heat i had to take from producers, writers, music attorneys and record execs etc who felt your mean spirited wrath and dropped you from labels, from startrack to them all. I stopped talking to jungle & steve stoute because of you & almost lost Anthony because of you. 
  
 [Part 4:] 
 You used to turn my phone off so my professionals couldn’t reach me and take the battery. You insulted any and everyone whoever was around me. Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you. Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDA’s or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are. Your self saboteur ways has caused you your grief your dealing with. Not me. The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST. Whenever one is constantly attacked the instinct is to restrain that person or defend yourself to prevent escalation. In hindsight now my advice to young men out there in a situation like that is to RUN at the very first sign of verbal abuse or physical. I herd you said terrible things about me. It makes me feel sad how heartless you can be. You play with strong women’s struggles like they mean nothing. You’re taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game? Like tearing down your son’s father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me. Guess what sis, he has eyes and ears and smart as ever. i don’t have to say anything. I think he knows what’s really good. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. You tell him GOD doesn’t love his dad because his dad doesn’t goto church. 
  
 [Part 5:] 
 Didn’t want to bring up money but since that’s the fuel behind all of this Let me say that I gave you the tools to be successful after you was dropped from your label. I paid for your cooking school cordon blue. 
 The expensive yellow stove we had flown in from Europe. I helped pay for the remodeling of your house. Your assistant stole thousands from my cc according to Amex. Out of all people you should be completely understanding of my my grind. But you just can’t win with you. My schedule is CRAZY but you never help me see my son. I’m hardly allowed to talk to him on the phone. Ever. 
 My lawyer told me bring the cops to your house and show my court orders when you don’t let me get him or answer your phone but who besides you wants to show their kids that his parents are that out of control? I’ve been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit for years. I finally got our custody together to work with both our schedule thru court, while leaving court you tell me your gonna get me back for fighting to see my son and 3 weeks later you’re on camera doing an interview about “your truth”. Interesting timing. Do what you want just don’t violate another court order sis because the judge won’t like that at all. The judge already ordered you to pay my legal fees because he was tired of you wasting everyone’s time in court. No lawyer wants to represent you after what you put them thru. That’s why you texted me today asking me for more child support money-and you want to keep it out court. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. Remember GOD sees all. And I’m no longer allowing you to take advantage of the fact that I did not want to respond in a manner that could affect my kids , friends or family publicly. THAT ENDS TODAY. 
  
 [Part 6:] 
 Everything with her is a plot and a scheme. Has no merit. No foundation 
 I didn’t Wana speak up because i have real respect for our women. And definitely my son. I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop. You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this. This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this. And although you tell everyone GOD hates me (some Christian you are) I will survive and thrive from this moment because I know who I am & you have not a clue who you are. 
  
 [Part 7:] 
 And to all the fans that knew my silence was due to the fact that I don’t openly do this kind of petty shit... I appreciate you riding. And to those that were lead down a wrong path... I get it... very sensitive times and all things must be taken seriously. This is MY TRUTH. And I don’t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I’m addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because whats best for her is what’s best for Knight. 
 Love,

 I, I, I wanna get to know you

 I, I, I just want to show you 
 How good it would be close to meIn a day of 1999 it had to happen 
 The result of man's stupidity became real 
 Death smell is everywhere 
 In their nicely worked out war plan 
 Through the sky come rockets down there people are scored 
 Everybody does try to save his own everywhere in town 
 On the run the people turn to animals 
 Love and hate does not exist here more 
 No more hope 
 Which led to the world's last breath 
 Fire does control our world till the end 
 Go fight stand up if you are not scared 
 Tell them the people are dead 
 The merciless radioactivity spread real fast 
 Burning skin makes the pain a torture, everybody gets blind 
 Can't feel hot and cold no more, it is so strange 
 Listen to the people helpless screams, it is too late 
 Moving forward slowly and together we are strong 
 We will tell them what we are thinking 
 About their bloody war 
 And we stop the war and there will be no hate 
 And we will together rule the world peacefullyI’d like to dedicate this one here 
 To my star 
 This the one I cherish 
 She loves me unconditionally 
 No matter what 
 My love will always be here for you baby 
 Yeah 
 So for god, who gave me this gift 
 You 
 I give you this

 (if i had it all)Verse One: 
 Yo, the Lord is my shepard 
 The sword is my weapon 
 Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle 
 Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son 
 'cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun 
 Before they choose an education 
 But once dead their ain't no awakenin' 
 So like once said, life ain't for fakin 
 Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em? 
 Fuck waitin' 
 Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation 
 Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan 
 When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination' 
 I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo 
 Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth 
 Is this the truth? 
 This is what we do, sip a brew 
 Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM 
 As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em 
 You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin' 
  
 Chorus - Okay, you wanna play rough?! 
 (gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes) repeat 3X 
 Okay yo, we could play rough! 
  
 Verse Two: 
 Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough? 
 Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck 
 I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas 
 Ducked in they seat? are they lookin' for me? 
 But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought 
 I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did 
 May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit 
 P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips 
 Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is 
 Pull the strap from under the seat 
 Back up in the street 
 Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep 
 Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat 
 Empty every shell in their direction 
 Its you, I should've guessed it! 
 Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you 
 Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Verse Three: 
 Walked in his house, smackin' him up, "what you talkin' about?" he said 
 Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome 
 Never thought I'd be in his home 
 With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone 
 Fuckin' with me, you should've known 
 I'll have 'em write "stupid nigga" on your tombstone 
 What money can do, get you hit for less than a G 
 For threatenin' me 
 I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free 
 Killin' you niggas with nothin' 
 Left him dead, engine runnin' 
 You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin' 
 Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault 
 They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it 
 But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib 
 For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live 
 Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back 
 I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac 
 Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that? 
 Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats 
 Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react 
 Eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback 
 Somebody kncokin', who dat? 
 "a cop man", let him in 
 And give that mothafucka one under the chin 
 Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds! 
 The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead 
 Dont explain, I put the pound on his head 
 Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said...... 
 Okay, so we gonna play rough! 
  
 ChorusYo... yeah... 
 It's that Queens shit, the real shit... 
 Illmatic... 
 It's the N-A-S, yes... yo... 
 I wake up every morning 
 Thinking what we gon' do today 
 (What we gon' do today) 
 There's got to be a better way 
 (Got to be a better way) 
 To maintain is the price of fame 
 Life is like a dice game 
 (Maintain is the price of fame) 
 Life is like a dice game 
 1, 2... 
 I never knock a brother 
 I'm anti-jail for real 
 Smooth criminal skill 
 Locked in a human flesh shield 
 Watching niggas get rich beside me 
 Pushing a 5 B-Y me 
 Up in the passenger seat 
 But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom 
 Sipping Asti Spumante 
 Dripped in, reality kicks in 
 I need the papes to start clicking 
 Got a connect out in Richmond 
 Every nigga in the fam will pitch it 
 It's on, word is bond 
 That's my name, big Nas 
 All wise to civilize 
 From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth 
 Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth 
 Destiny, that's her name 
 It's going on 
 You know my name 
 Big Nas in the house, y'all 
 On the freestyle tip 
 When I finish this shit 
 It's sure to be a hit

 Cuz Your Little Girl Is Bangin' Down The Door Of My Bedroom She Tryin' To Get Inside of My  Fruit Of The Looms She Hopes To Have My Heirlooms  Passin' Down My Grandfather's Crown Jewels

 The Fear Of The Black Mans Penis (Can't Hide It's In Your Face, America it's  In Your Face) 
 The Fear Of The Black Man's Dick (Father Of The Place, All The Ladies Love The Taste Of Tha Nigga)Uhh, ooh baby, baby 
 Keep it thug and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah 
  
 Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me 
 I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me 
 For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid 
 Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful 
  
 First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe) 
 Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable 
 Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do 
 But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha) 
  
 I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth 
 From Jags to Bentleys to plenty ass bitches 
 Can't keep they hands to theyself no more 
 I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a 
  
 Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch 
 You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down 
 So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony 
 You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only 
  
 But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak 
 You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day 
 But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson 
 Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction 
  
 You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy 
 It's childish; should I have to resort to violence? 
 Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album 
 And show you how to stay off my dick 
  
 That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man 
 When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans 
 No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection 
 You unlucky, I'm your fuckin' c-section 
  
 Plus I'm the last real nigga alive 
 Toast glass, ill will, the label get high 
 Realize, how many classics I gave you 
 Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you 
  
 Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch 
 You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down 
 So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony 
 You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only 
  
 But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak 
 You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day 
 But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson 
 Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction 
  
 You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line 
 Why they tryin to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line 
 Eating alligators and hummingbird hearts 
 At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch 
  
 As real millionaire, shit'll take place 
 Evil as Hitler's hate-race people, this is God son 
 And I've come from the God under pure peace 
 To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan 
  
 Is not to destroy your man 
 But to bring more to mankind and teach 
 Every MC reach for your pens and papers 
 Lesson one be creative; what you made of Junior? 
  
 'Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand 
 And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan 
 I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that 
 And you my offspring, the boss sting 
  
 A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that 
 Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at? 
 Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me 
 If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in 
  
 What the fuck was you niggas thinkin'? 
 Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin' that you comin for the kingpin 
 But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha 
 Take me out, try try try, but you 
  
 Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch 
 You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down 
 So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony 
 You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only 
  
 But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak 
 You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day 
 But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson 
 Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction 
  
 You can't be meLight somethin', stop frontin' 
 How much money's enough? Think maybe like the trillion figures 
 Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton Sisters 
 That'd kill me yo, filthy rich 
 My daughter pass it on to the next generation 
 Throwing carnations at my tombstone 
 In my new home, meet moms in my Yves St. Laurent suit on 
 Then we do a dance like my man Luther Jam 
 But my verse came first 
 I stole change out her purse 
 Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth 
 Too morbid, learn forward toward a new paragraph 
 Blue carats, D-Class, strictly that kush in the weed bag 
 Tryna figure out what Berry Gordy had put in production 
 Studio smoky now, hard like David Ruffin 
 Hit a spliff through a sÃ©ance 
 And I, play on playa 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Gotta get your papes on, play on playa 
 Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters 
 Do the yacht thing, mÃ©nage swing, baby 
 Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Get your papes on, play on playa 
 Get your papes on, play on playa 
 Get your papes on 
 Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose 
 Rubies in Hey-Zeus piece 
 Pimped out like Snoop be, but an East Coast thing 
 My girl stocking tied up in a knot, top of my bean head 
 Billion dollar dream hear 
 Went from triple beams to digital 
 Serving fiends, the minimal, 60 G's, no criminal 
 No mo', just mo' doe, mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings on fingers 
 While your girl performs cunnilingus 
 'Cause this big money aroma lingers 
 Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade 
 Hot towel on the face 
 Hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight 
 Swallowing my protein like an Ovaltine shake 
 Come through like Moe Green from Godfather, so clean 
 Where I step, I Clorox it 
 Keep 20 G's on both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets 
 Eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price 
 But we ain't into buying Conflict Ice 
 That's the **** they stole from the Congo and other black soil 
 True mack for you, nappy hair, just spinnin' 
 Honey gave me a massage with the happy ending 
 Finest females I just came on, and sprayed her 
 Gotta get your papes on, play on playa 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Gotta get your papes on, play on playa 
 Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters 
 Do the yacht thing, mÃ©nage swing, baby 
 Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy 
 Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her 
 Get your papes on, play on playa 
 It's kinda hard for a playa like you 
 But let me show you how a **** like me get revenue 
 What you never do is punk out, what you better do 
 Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view 
 Better yet a better crew, praise God, I'ma marry you 
 Get your homie, carry you, bury you 
 Slowly, roll me another blunt stuff it 
 Lick it, puff it, tuck it, **** it 
 That man, that gang, that bang it was 
 In D O double G we trust 
 Yep yep, young loc with the two steps 
 He creepin' with two Tecs, he's sleepin' with two chicks 
 Right before he blast, all you heard was two clicks 
 End of existence, for instance 
 Rewind it, replay it, re-chop it, remix it 
 Re-twist it, goddamn D O double G, 'cause we missed it 
 Travel slow, I'm a Indian but not a Navajo 
 I smoke the big leaf in all the big deef's 
 My hair in two braids, I'm the big Chief 
 Ladahdah be dahdadah 
 Yeah, break that down, how fresh ya are 
 The King from Queens, Mr. Escobar 
 Connect with the best from the west, yes yes ya are 
 Oh, my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas, playa play onAmerican born, American raised, American made 
  
 [Chorus 2X] 
 My country shitted on me (My country) 
 She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never) 
 Cause the things I seen (We know too much) 
 Cause the things I seen (We seen too much) 
  
 [Verse 1 (Nas)] 
 It was packed on the Ryker's bus 
 The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled 
 The life of a thug caught in the devil's lap 
 On the streets I was invincible 
 Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew 
 What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa 
 Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me 
 All in front of my friends 
 In the street smile with no teeth 
 I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy 
 Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3 
 Why didn't my folks just die in this society 
 Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me 
 Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat 
 Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me 
 I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father 
 Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers 
 Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high 
 It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry 
  
 [Repeat Chorus] 
  
 [Verse 2 (Millenium Thug)] 
 It is I that step up 
 Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier 
 Hummers and Range's through the desert 
 Fuck a 20 years, long as we got gas and we got water 
 Troopers lookin' for manslaughter 
 I gotta get back, for what they owe 
 Shoot'em in the back for the get back 
 Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag 
 Forget the life had, now we all rebels 
 Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto 
 We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble 
 And debris from the earth as we knew crumble 
 Yo you could see the sea 
 And the stars look closer to me 
 I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max 
 S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap 
 My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back 
 But yo 
  
 [Repeat Chorus] 
  
 [Verse 3 (Nas + Millenium Thug)] 
 Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls 
 I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God 
 Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape 
 Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape 
 How is the war 
 And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes 
 Holdin' machine guns 
 Clean fun shootin' ducks with fatigues on 
 Anywhere is better than this 
 It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit 
 Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares 
 I know the warden is readin' the scribe 
 [MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business 
 Courts, lawyers and jails 
 We all slaves in this business, I'm bout to rebel 
  
 [Verse 4 (Millenium Thug)] 
 There's not a bitch in sight 
 All block bench, all block gates 
 All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President 
 I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent 
 Now it's state of the art 
 I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart 
 What a bloody mess, a slug fest 
 I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin' 
 You know I'm spittin' mine 
 I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win 
 Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in 
 I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head 
 Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back 
 Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass 
 I don't know what they broadcast, the news hash is fake 
 Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape 
 And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say 
  
 [Repeat Chorus] 
  
 [Nas] 
 This goes out to Jake Rivera... 
 Revolutionary destroyed by his own country,just tryin to fight for whats real 
 This goes out to my nigga Malcom Alhazbalishibaz... 
 Just tryin to fight for whats real 
 This goes out to Martin... 
 All about peace and destroyed by his own country 
 This goes out to everybody in the whole world... 
 Just tryin to fight for whats real 
 To Petrish Lamoumba... 
 Just tryin to fight for whats real and destroyed by his own people 
 This goes out to my hood niggas... 
 Coming up every day just tryin to survive the only way we know how 
 But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now 
 So ain't nothing goin stop us now 
  
 [fading] 
 My country.... 
 My country.... 
 My country.... 
 My country....NAS 
 "Get-get.. get down!" 
  
 New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete 
 And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration 
 Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem 
 Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin' 
 Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's 
 But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities 
 Worldwide on the thorough side of things 
 Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time 
 One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat 
 40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me 
 "What you up to, the cops goin' bust you" 
 I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered 
 If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block 
 And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched 
 I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair 
 Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do 
 Yeah man, throwin' them bones 
 Hopin my ace get his case thrown 
 His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein' 
 While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls 
 Showin' they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof 
 The D.A. who tried him was lyin' 
 A white dude, killed his mother durin' the case 
 Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein' replaced 
 Pre-trial hearin' is over, it's real for the soldier 
 Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild 
 Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle 
 I want to crack a smile when I see him 
 Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom 
 He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin' 
 Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leavin' everybody 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Get down, get down! Get down, get down!" [Repeats] 
 Everybody 
 "Get down, get down! Get down, get down!" 
  
 [Nas] 
 Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em 
 Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em 
 They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget 
 Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs 
 Southern niggas, independent label, real killers 
 Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin' 
 They had the coke game somethin' crazy 
 Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me 
 Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin' 
 Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them 
 Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me 
 I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy 
 Now I'm back around the old school that raised me 
 New York gangstas, we loungin', out in L.A. see 
 A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay 
 The letter say, "Nas I got your back - the fools don't play" 
 I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral 
 Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible 
 The nigga still alive in a hospital 
 Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too 
 See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things 
 He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano 
 Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano 
 She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile 
 Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed 
 Openin' the hotel room do', to let her goons in 
 But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit 
 I let the hammers blow, wet three kids 
 See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama 
 Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed 
 Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you 
 He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I really gotta say is that 
 If that's how our people goin' get down, how we ever goin' get up? 
 How we ever goin' get up if that's how we get down? 
 A shame when you ain't look at it 
 My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk 
 Somebody gotta make a changeLook here see 
 Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal 
 Found the body dead in the isles 
 Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad 
 Guess they'll never play it again Sam 
 Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lamb 
 She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam! 
 While these two compete on who's the star of the show 
 Golden legs there makes off with the dough 
 I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher 
 He says one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker 
 They say her old man's a bootlegger 
 Transporting in any weather, and at this rate we'll never get her 
 Fellas, think it's time to call it a night 
 All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight 
 Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 
 Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin', the same? 
 Waiter another round for the gang 
 It's strange how I always felt outta place 
 Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face 
 So I said 'Ssee you later' 
 'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 
 He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators 
 An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper 
 So I pulled the revolver on my waist up 
 Between the patrol car and the gray truck 
 Behind the street lamp was a silhouette 
 White gloves and a real long cigarette 
 What do ya know all this time she's got me in her scope 
 She spoke says the Devil got you guys by the throat 
 Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence 
 That's the reason why Eric B is not president 
 Well, what do ya say 
 Ya see? 
 Ya see? 
 Ya see? 
 Look here see 
 I know you got soul you're trying to hide it 
 How did you kill a man out in Cypres 
 One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded 
 Says you guys did it **** is he lyin' 
 She says, 'Walk this way I'll tell you a children's story' 
 We hit the bodega got her a few 40's 
 We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried 
 Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 
 Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty 
 Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy 
 The truth came out as we got to her suave house 
 Chopped and screwed, her mouth and sat me on the couch 
 I said it's gettin late c'mon give it to me straight 
 Who's ya sponsor lady? She says Bill Gates 
 What are ya born '77 or '78? 
 She said, â€½Nah it goes way to an earlier dateâ€ 
 Slave times, claims the slaves said rhymes 
 But she fell in love with some fella named Clive 
 Who? Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave 
 The Bronx, now she shows me the cash 
 I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt 
 She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc 
 Listen up sweetheart, now we gettin' somewhere 
 As she's talkin' she starts vanishing in thin air 
 But before she drops the money bag on the floor and died 
 She said, â€½If you really love me I'll come back aliveâ€ 
 Hip hop is so **** dead!Its ny state of mindYeah, check it, uh 
 Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa 
 Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya 
 Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka 
 Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer 
 Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars 
 Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue? 
 I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew 
 What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to? 
 You ain't got the ghetto with you 
 Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse 
 Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about 
 The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect 
 Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh 
 We ain't got no choices who to choose 
 Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices 
 And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites 
 Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick 
 Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools 
 About poor children, then she gotta prove that she 
 Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool 
 Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules 
 Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused 
 Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose 
 Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry 
 On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey 
 You MC's on that old slavery path 
 The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh 
 See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves 
 Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells 
 It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win 
 Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh 
  
 [Chorus: Kelis] 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin 
 It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen 
 I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place 
 Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin' 
 It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening 
 This man leans in, his boys laughing 
 Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens 
 Says, "Since all Black women care about is who got dough 
 And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe" 
 I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold 
 Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go 
 The biggest example in scandal of history 
 Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree 
 Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci 
 Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies 
 But who are we to blame, not the dames 
 It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same 
 Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth 
 So they deserve to earn man's purse 
 Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime 
 Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh 
  
 [Chorus: Kelis singing] 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit 
 ([Nas:] That's the American way) 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit 
 ([Nas:] Cause that's the American way. What up, K?) 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit 
 ([Nas:] That's the American way) 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit 
 ([Nas:] Ha, yeah) 
  
 I don't care about the runaways 
 I don't care about who's gay 
 I don't care about dying of AIDS 
 But I care if I got paid 
 Who even cares about the president? 
 I think they're making a mistake 
 I don't care about the hurricane 
 As long as my family's safe 
 I don't care about the candidates 
 They burnt this country to bits 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way ([Nas:] Uh) 
  
 Can we make a change 
 You know it's not overnight 
 Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh) 
 Can we make a change 
 You know it's not overnight 
 Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah) 
 Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American WayI'd like to dedicate this one here, to my star 
 Someone I cherish, she loves me unconditionally

 I think I can remember some... 
  
 Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister 
 Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista 
 Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her 
 Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker 
 Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick 
 Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement 
 Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her 
 Put hickeys on her stomach 
 Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw 
 Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume 
 That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude 
 Used to put my face in her crotch 
 Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched 
 Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer 
 While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha 
 While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you 
  
 [Nas] 
 Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes 
 Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction 
 Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection 
 Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log 
 Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind 
 Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us 
 Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher 
 Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa 
 The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong 
 Under the coat and 
 Put a show on just to show me she loved me 
 She would undress and wait in zero below weather 
 In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive 
 Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you 
  
 [Nas] 
 Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin' 
 Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin 
 Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it 
 Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets 
 Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters 
 Long chin, some with funny odors 
 Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese 
 Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease 
 And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool 
 And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww 
 Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas 
 Principles are lined up, things prioritized 
 Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown 
 It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer 
 Are we tempted 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 (now we could properly begin this) 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do 
 Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few 
 Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you[Intro: AZ, and Nas] 
 Ayo, what's up, what's up? 
 Let's keep it real, son, count this money 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah 
 Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 ‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons 
 The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go 
 I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right? 
 Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yo, then what, man, what?! 
  
 [Verse 1: AZ] 
 Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality 
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary 
 And my mentality is money-orientated 
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
 ‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters 
 But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners 
 Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin 
 Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition 
 Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us 
 'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
 Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go 
 But as long as we leavin' thievin' 
 We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough 
 So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors 
 Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers 
 Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high 
 ‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin' 
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and 
 My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it 
 One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created 
 Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some 
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from 
 My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain 
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain 
 When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard 
 Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards 
 Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash 
 And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash 
 Now it's all about cash in abundance 
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds 
 I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!" 
 That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto 
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks 
 I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back 
 Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric 
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage 
  
 [Chorus: AZ] 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye 
 ‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die[Lyrics missing][Verse 1]

 Squeeze! 
 Squeezin' on ya; real niggas creepin' on ya 
  
 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 I got cream, some ganja trees, and fronto leaves 
 Honda bikes, diamond dykes, rubbin' me, lovin' me 
 Don't let my seed hear this, cover her ears 
 Real shit; no surrender, no fear, we pioneers 
 Of all this ice shit, biscuits, and tight whips, rims 
 Bangin' blends in the S-Class, half a thousand 
 Slap pounds with cats who shot down shit 
 Real niggas who stay around chips, and down Cris 
 Sips of Henny; chicks who bless you, finessin' it, professional 
 Slob with ice cubes, just like Vanessa do 
 Reppin Q, smoke amazing Thai 
 Shit that givin' you triple Asian eye 
 Yeah, bitch, a nigga stayin' fly 
 From tube socks and Timbs, to blue rocks, a Benz 
 Who got the ends? 
 The type'll make 2Pac [?] 
 To all niggas who shine; yes, who got revenge 
 I won't showboat, my flow choke you 
 And if it don't, the fo' fo'll smoke you 
 Left your seed reminiscin' on ya 
 MC's I'm pissin' on ya 
 Shine cause my chips are longer 
 It's gremlins I'm sic'n on ya 
 Shots your dodgin' 
 While Esco could rock the whole fuckin' Garden 
 Real niggas always gon' play this shit..[Intro: Sample] 
 Forget the terrorist alerts, we need some ghetto alerts 
 Information we could use, you know: 
 “Ray-Ray’s on parole, stay off the streets” 
 Invasion! 
 The Evil Genius 
 Green Lantern! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “So you know I seen it all before”

 [Verse 1: Nas] 
 It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose 
 There's only one Nas, bout a hundred thousand yous 
 You lose money chasing women 
 Never lose women chasing money 
 Niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry 
 Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money 
 Morgues full of niggas who the last shit they ate in they stomach 
 Spinach and steak, GORE-TEX bootprint still on his face 
 It’s stillon his face when we visit his wake 
 Whatever's undone, I'd do it 
 Fight against a whole army, one gun I'll use it 
 Some Sun Tzu shit (Green Lantern) 
 Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia 
 You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments 
 I stay in deceitful conversations 
 With creeps with foul natures 
 Attempted murders trials, the basics 
 Threatening the witnesses 
 And relatives of dead victims; it’s the shit we live 
 (Ghetto!) Queensbridge thug matrimony, clap a phony 
 Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie 
 Psychoanalyst was asking me what happened to me? 
 See the 'gnac got to me, then the gat got to me 
 Then, the homies on the block with the stacks of money 
 Then, these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me 
 Then, lames put the rap game in a casket slowly 
 Man, I don't give a fuck; this is rap to me 
  
 [Chorus:] 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “So you know I seen it all before” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “So you know I seen it all before”

 Yo, Joell Ortiz, man, go in! (Yaowa!) 
 Yo, Green, let’s take ‘em on a ride through the ghetto! 
  
 [Verse 2: Joell Ortiz] 
 Planet Earth (Yaowa), the land of the worst, handle ya turf 
 Cannons’ll burst and break the wrists of amateur jerks (Huh!) 
 Damn, it’ll hurt to know your man in that hearse 
 I seen it ten times (For real) 
 They get a small article, never the headlines (Damn) 
 Candles in the lobby next to empty ‘gnac bottles 
 Niggas drunk, talking shit 
 Like, “When they see this Mac nozzle,” but (What?) 
 Nothing ever happens 
 Even if it do, nothing ever happens (Nah!) 
 We don’t talk and that ain’t gutter if you yapping 
 In the ghetto (Woo!), you could ask a nigga mother what happened and get a echo 
 Where I’m from, it’s so bad (Bad) 
 Bunch of ignorant motherfuckers with no dads 
 Or he there but he don’t care 
 'Cause he nursing his dope hab’ (For real) 
 And when him and they moms argue, he always throw jabs 
 So they grip a chrome mag 
 And walk around like “Who want a toe-tag?” (What up?) 
 Fiending to leave a head see-through like a coat bag 
 If your life slightly something like the one that Joe had 
 Then you... (Ghetto!) 
 Group of Ps, scoop cheese, duck Ds, and squeeze (C’mon) 
 Breeze in old hoopties bumping new Ortiz (Ah!) 
 And the hoochies please, jeez, by getting on they knees 
 Giving the body part what Scarecrow needs (Haha!) 
 I’m living my life, the shit that I write is from e my heart, my word 
 So go in your pocket, grab a Sharpie, homie, mark my words 
 If anybody interfere with me and these bucks 
 I ain’t only ending careers, dog, I’m beating you up 
 I’m still ghetto! 
  
 [Chorus:] 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “So you know I seen it all before” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking” 
 (Ghetto!) “The same shit is going on” 
 “So you know I seen it all before”

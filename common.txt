 [Intro] 
 Yeah, doo-doo-doo 
 Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo 
  
 [Hook] 
 There are times 
 When you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin' for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Some niggas recognize the light 
 But they can't handle the glare 
 You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I want to be the one to make you happiest 
 And hurt you the most 
 They say the end is near, it's important that we close 
 To the most high 
 Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely 
  
 [Hook] 
 There are times 
 When you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's important we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write 
 For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall 
 For better or worse times, I hope to me you call 
 So I pray every day more than anything 
 Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay 
 This foundation for a family, love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually? 
 Granted we known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 [Hook] 
 There are times 
 When you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Plus you shit pop when it's time to 
 Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to 
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love, it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good 
 I know the sex ain't gon' keep you 
 But as my equal, it's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'ma lead you 
 And whatever's right I'ma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace! 
  
 [Hook] 
 There are times 
 When you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'll take my chances 
 Before they pass 
 Pass me by, oh, darling 
 You need to look at the other side 
 You'll agree[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I met this girl when I was 10 years old 
 And what I loved most she had so much soul 
 She was old school when I was just a shorty 
 Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me 
 On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular 
 Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her 
 But I respected her, she hit me in the heart 
 A few New York niggas had did her in the park 
 But she was there for me, and I was there for her 
 Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her 
 And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her 
 Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her 
 Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be 
 ‘Cause we related, physically and mentally 
 And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around 
 Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground 
 Original, pure, untampered, a down sister 
 Boy, I tell you, I miss her 
  
 [Chorus] 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now periodically I would see 
 Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties 
 She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick 
 Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric 
 Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions 
 She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence 
 About my people she was teachin' me 
 By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me 
 In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach 
 She dug my rap, that's how we got close 
 But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool 
 Cause around the same time, I went away to school 
 And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way? 
 She probably get her money in L.A 
 And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul 
 She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style 
 She said, "Afrocentricity was of the past" 
 So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz 
 Now black music is black music and it's all good 
 I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood 
 Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded 
 I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit 
 Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone 
 And you could tell by how her titties hung 
  
 [Chorus] 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative 
 Once the man got to her, he altered her native 
 Told her if she got an image and a gimmick 
 That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy 
 Now I see her in commercials, she's universal 
 She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle 
 Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie 
 And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city 
 Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches 
 Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches 
 Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk 
 Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk 
 Stressin' how hardcore and real she is 
 She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz 
 I did her, not just to say that I did it 
 But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it 
 That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her 
 I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer 
 But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop 
 ‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop 
  
 [Chorus] 
 To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot 
 A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R 
 I used to love H.E.R., went and fucked up all the shit, y'all 
  
 [Outro: The Five Heartbeats sample] 
 You ain't got your woman in check, man? 
 I think you’re overstepping your bounds just a little bit 
 I can't do this anymore[Produced by John Legend] 
  
 [Chorus: John Legend] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory) 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon 
 Formed against, yes glory is destined 
 Every day women and men become legends 
 Sins that go against our skin become blessings 
 The movement is a rhythm to us 
 Freedom is like religion to us 
 Justice is juxtapositionin' us 
 Justice for all just ain't specific enough 
 One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us 
 True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us 
 That's why Rosa sat on the bus 
 That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up 
 When it go down we woman and man up 
 They say, "Stay down", and we stand up 
 Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up 
 King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory (glory, glory) 
 Ohh (glory, glory) 
  
  
 [Bridge: John Legend] 
 Now the war is not over, victory isn't won 
 But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done 
 We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory) 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Selma is now for every man, woman and child 
 Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd 
 They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now 
 Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles 
 From dark roads he rose, to become a hero 
 Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people 
 Enemy is lethal, a king became regal 
 Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle 
 The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful 
 We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through 
 Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany 
 Now we right the wrongs in history 
 No one can win the war individually 
 It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy 
 Welcome to the story we call victory 
 The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) 
 Oh (glory, glory) 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) 
 Yeah (glory, glory) 
  
 [Outro: John Legend] 
 When the war is won, when it's all said and done 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory)[Verse 1] 
 My motto is: Chicago, bitch 
 Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is 
 Don’t play dumb, I’m the one that acknowledged it 
 Son of a bitch, I imagine what your father is 
 She said, “How you make your opponent 
 The rapper of the moment?” His style, he don’t own it 
 Acting all hard when he hardly like that 
 You gon’ mess around and make me catch a body like that 
 Awwww, don’t do it 
 Cause every song you make, Joe, is really ho music 
 I heard you said you wasn’t a bitch because you sing 
 You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that’s eighteen 
 Can’t say my name but rap about a nigga’s wife 
 You so black and white, trying to live a nigga’s life 
 I’m taking too long with this amateur guy 
 You ain’t wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry 
  
 [Outro] 
 Soft nigga. Make no mistake, I’m talking to Drake 
 It’s the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that ho-ass nigga 
 No, man-to-man, don’t hide behind them other niggas 
 Nah, this man-to-man. You can’t run behind them man 
 This is some real man shit right here 
  
 [Destiny’s Child sample] 
 Say my name, say my name 
 If no one is around you 
 If you ain't running game 
 Say my name, say my name 
 You acting kinda shady 
 Why the sudden change? 
 Say my name, say my name 
 If no one is around you 
 If you ain’t running game 
 Say my name, say my name 
 You acting kinda shady 
 Better say my name[Hook] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, you know what love is 
 Even found it on the ground where the thugs live 
 My man had to dig deep to find his 
 Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids 
 Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it 
 At crap games, black dames and big faces 
 Cases in court, fam' showing love and support 
 You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport 
 As men we were taught to hold it in 
 That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men 
 If love is a place I'ma go again 
 At least now, now I know to go within 
 At times it can take ya for a spin 
 Heartbreak hotel then you're home again 
 I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend 
 Like a story that he don't want to end 
 Yo 
  
 [Hook] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's all love where we come from 
 In the hood love we was told to run from 
 That same hood where the guns sung 
 We holla love, hoping it'd become one 
 Crack got so many lives undone 
 From lack of love many hide some run 
 I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays 
 Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze 
 Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave 
 Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave 
 Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave 
 Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid? 
 Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade? 
 Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays 
 Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand 
 What it is to be loved by a man 
  
 [Hook] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Some say that I'm a dreamer cause I talk about it often 
 Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin 
 We walk and stand in, fall in it 
 With the right companion we all in it 
 Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits 
 In the game of life, it's the scrimmage 
 Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days 
 A letter to the people, love always 
 Yeah 
  
 [Hook] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me[Hook: Kanye West (& John Mayer)]

 Yeah 
 You know they be asking ’bout Common, where he at? 
 What that man doing now? 
 I’m doing what I do, hip-hop 
 That's what I do 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 How can I say this, fuck it I’m the greatest 
 I am the A-list for all these great debaters 
 A lot of ya’ll nah nah, forgot now who I am 
 The '87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam 
 Aw yeah, we put them things in the air 
 When I drop a single, it’s really like a pair 
 Of Air Jordans, important to the culture 
 If you ain't true to it, cállate la boca 
 Get my drink on like a coaster 
 Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off 
 Hip-hop Master Cleansin', I’mma get my shit off 
 Rollin’ in a Maserati Gran with the lid off 
 I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore 
 Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners 
 My name synonymous with prominence 
 I’m to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics 
 Common is 
  
 [Interlude: Common] 
 Yeah, man 
 Y’all niggas man, you soft muthafuckers 
 Yeah my man, muthafucker 
 Then come around my crib 
 You know where I’m from 
 Some ho ass niggas 
 Singing all around me man, la la la 
 You ain't muthafucking Frank Sinatra 
 Uh, lil' bitch 
 Yeah, this the raw right here 
 This the raw right here nigga 
 Sweet muthafucka 
 Sweet ass bitch muthafucka 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Wa da da da, wa dada dada dang 
 The C-O double-M O-N, I’m not playin’ 
 Da da man at work, I make my own lane 
 I’m the franchise so I rock my own chain 
 No I said give 'em that 80′s cocaine 
 Somethin’ raw, something pure so I stayed in that vein 
 The hero that he know, that he cold 
 Like when it's below in the G.O., wipe ya feet off in the Regal 
 I’m king, observe the throne and the dream 
 I have it, supreme like mathematics 
 Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts 
 Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic 
 Rap we won’t jam in traffic 
 The game need direction, I’m here to map it 
 Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity 
 But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me 
 Sweet 
  
 [Outro: Common] 
 You know man, you should know where I come from 
 You should know who I am nigga 
 You should never wanna go against me 
 You know man, you too soft for that man 
 I be seeing you man, I see it in your eyes man 
 You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me 
 You get in my presence you gon’ feel like a little ho 
 You ain't a man yet, you tryna be somebody else 
 Man, be yourself man, you come around my crib, you get your shit took 
 Huh! Wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo shit took 
 You’s a ho, you know you sweet 
 Ain't nothing you can do man, people see that man 
 Broads be seeing you sweet 
 Done wit’ you muthafuckas, it’s over for you 
 It’s over for you 
 It’s over, sweet muthafucka[Produced by Kanye West] 
  
 [Verse] 
 I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left 
 I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef 
 Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection 
 For moms, new steps in a direction 
 In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay 
 And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say" 
 Chicago nights they, stay on the mind 
 But I write many lives, they, lay on these lines 
 Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind 
 Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme 
 Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized 
 We got arms but won't reach for the skies 
 Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes 
 And realize I'ma learn through her 
 The Messiah, might even return through her 
 If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her 
 Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em 
 Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him 
 The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun 
 Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones 
 Walk like warriors, we were never told to run 
 Explored the world to return to where my soul begun 
 Never looking back, or too far in front of me 
 The present is a gift, and I just want to be[Intro: (Common) and Sample]

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams 
 The young Denzel the way I move through scenes 
 I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend 
 A story of change that came with wings 
 Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline 
 Son of the most so from up high I shine 
 Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala 
 Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga 
 I’m the cum-lada, top of the class 
 Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash 
 Given what I ask, pure religion and cash 
 From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass 
 Daylight beams, night life schemes 
 This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams 
 Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do 
 I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through 
  
 [Hook: Makeba] 
 Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies 
 And we going higher, that's right 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C 
 The Lord put the blessing upon the MC 
 O to the M, dreams were spoken to him 
 That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim 
 Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for 
 To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or 
 D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose 
 International heroes at world primos 
 Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president 
 Told him for health care, my music is the medicine 
 My name holds weight, I am never hesitant 
 Different state resident, this is hood elegance 
 SLS classic, pursuing my passion 
 NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing 
 Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do 
 I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through 
  
 [Hook: Makeba] 
 Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies 
 And we going higher, that's right 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh 
 Even now it don't seem so bad, ma 
 Close my eyes to see things in front of me 
 I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be 
 Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy 
 My broad up in Paris, looking all purty 
 Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do 
 I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through 
  
 [Hook: Makeba] 
 Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies 
 And we going higher, that's right 
  
 [Outro: Makeba] 
 I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere 
 I could see it from my window 
 Wouldn't take that long to get me there 
 Keep running til' I can go 
 Remember the beautiful things that life could give me 
 Crazy how I'm the one 
 Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air 
 With the wheels up staring at the sun 
 Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Ohh, until high we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies 
 And we going higher, that's right[Prod. by No I.D.]

 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams

 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 From the hood 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I want a bitch that look good and cook good 
 Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood 
 Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes 
 Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes 
 We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake 
 Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait 
 To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned 
 Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible 
 The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for 
 Is the type that I ride and stay alive for 
 Tats on her back, looking all tribal 
 She know shoes like she know survival 
 Well put together, she weathered the storm 
 Seen her brother die so forever she's strong 
 Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform 
 Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 From the hood 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I don't even say shit, she can feel it 
 Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic 
 Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it 
 Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet 
 Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony 
 Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia 
 Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana 
 Reminded me a me of my, of my mama 
 Knowing the drama like she know when to joke 
 Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke 
 I poke my head out of Benzes 
 My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is 
 Endless love for the money, power and clothes 
 My ghetto housewife watch reality shows 
 She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed 
 When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose 
  
 [Hook] 
 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams

 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 From the hood 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes 
 Subject matter be changing too quickly at times 
 So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story 
 Call me a pro in the pussy category 
 Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention 
 For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction 
 Powerful women playing the roles of submission 
 Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin' 
 Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic 
 They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted 
 'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit 
 Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence 
 But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra 
 African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor 
 Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors 
 Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours 
 She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals 
 Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors 
 Half hood half class, photographers' cameras 
 Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this 
 She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit 
 Events having sponsored by some alcohol product 
 Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms 
 You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects 
  
 [Hook] 
 Ghetto dreams

 From the hood[Intro: Common] 
 Yeah! It's been a long time comin' 
 You know what they say Kanye 
 Slow motion better than no motion 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 I walked in the crib, got two kids 
 And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!) 
 So I had to did, what I had to did 
 Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!) 
 I'm up all night, getting my money right 
 Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!) 
 Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know 
 Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 You love to hear the story, again and again 
 About these young brothers, from the City of Wind 
 Like juice and gin, in the city we blend 
 Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims 
 Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed 
 Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em 
 Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim 
 Pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims 
 We livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin' 
 On the block white is selling like Eminem 
 On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em 
 On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then 
 Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin' 
 Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dim in them 
 Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him 
 He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 I walked in the crib, got two kids 
 And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!) 
 So I had to did, what I had to did 
 Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!) 
 I'm up all night, getting my money right 
 Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!) 
 Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know 
 Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms 
 Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims 
 Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts 
 We never fall short, with us it's all Force like Air 1's 
 Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for 
 Cats is colder than four below, with self I go toe to toe 
 Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough 
 Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go 
 Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto 
 Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind 
 Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up 
 Clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up 
 Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter 
 Situations, and jaws get tighter 
 My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon! 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West] 
 I walked in the crib, got two kids 
 And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!) 
 So I had to did, what I had to did 
 Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!) 
 I'm up all night, getting my money right 
 Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!) 
 Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know 
 Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!) 
  
 [Bridge: Kanye West] 
 I, I know I could make it right 
 If I could just swallow my pride 
 But I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me 
 I, no I can't let it ride 
 No, no, not tonight 
 See I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I break bread with thieves and pastors, OG's and masters 
 Emcees and actors that seize and capture 
 Moments like the camcorder 
 You ain't killin' it, yo that's manslaughter 
 Though paper can't change a man's aura 
 It can feed a man's daughter 
 I stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars 
 Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like 
  
 [Bridge: Kanye West] 
 I, I know I could make it right 
 If I could just swallow my pride 
 But I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me 
 I, no I can't let it ride 
 No, no, not tonight 
 See I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me[Sonny Carson Sample] 
 That's right He got - I got to take him off of here. That's right. I gotta take him off of here. 'Cause there's only one, and that's me, you understand? 'Fore all of that fightin', you understand? The sucker think he good, the sucker think he can whoop me. And I knew he can't whoop me, huh? Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand? 
  
 [Intro] 
 One two, yeah 
 Coming through, yeah 
 Fa' sho' 
 Ha, Com Sense, yeah 
 Southside, yeah 
 Niggas be outside, yeah 
 Now bust it out, Chi-Town 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A bitch nigga with an attitude named Cube 
 Stepped to the Com with a feud 
 Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast? 
 You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
 Wanted deceased from the Midwest to the East 
 On the dick of the East for your first release 
 Your lease is up at the crib, house niggas get evicted 
 In videos with white boys talking you get wicked 
 Natural born killa, nigga you natural born God 
 Read, rich, got the nerve to say you rob 
 Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your death certificate 
 Slinging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
 Shoulda repented on the 16th of October 
 Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
 Rap career is over, better off acting 
 What trouble I see in managing WC and Wack 10? 
 You backed into a four corner hustla 
 Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her 
 Use higher learning, don't take my words out of 'text 
 Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 
 It'll take the nation of millions to hold me back 
 From giving you mouth shots or hit with the pipe that Ralph got 
 Chris Tucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 
 I wasn't salty, she was with the Boyz N the Hood 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
 The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lying 
 I see the bitch in you, to be hard, you trying 
 The bitch in you, for sho', it's coming out (BITCH!) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The ump of this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
 I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse 
 This ain't no East Coast, West Coast, none of the above 
 I'm from Chi, I went to Cali (and what?) niggas gave me love 
 There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
 Grafted-ass nigga, I see through your glass shield 
 Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 
 I'm a have to wreck a HO'Shea 
 I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
 (So what?) so I had to slap her, uh 
 And violate you (you), a Muslim drinking brew (brew) 
 Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
 I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL 
 Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell- 
 It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
 A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
 Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable 
 Hoo-bangin', you ain't banging shit but the table 
 And the circle mad, ain't got no choice but to fight 
 Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic 
 Any time you come out, joe, I'ma talk about you 
 Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you 
 Any last words before I hit the switch? 
 From the immortal words of one: "a bitch iz a..." 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
 The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lying 
 I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you trying 
 The bitch in you, for sho', it's coming out (BITCH!) 
  
 [Outro] 
 That's how the Eastside gets down, word up![Intro] 
 For the world, world, world 
 My name is Common, No I.D 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers 
 Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us 
 Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now 
 Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now 
 Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now 
 Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now 
 We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love 
 It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up 
 Known to tear the club and the block up 
 Going through the airport with more lye than an opera 
 Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter 
 Get cleaners to get it cleaner 
 A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer 
 Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger 
 Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer 
 A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima 
 Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina 
 Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina 
 I'm a dreamer 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's for the world, world, world, world, world 
 Dream on 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 We take, uh, we make, uh, paper 
 And build skyscrapers 
 Walking on water, building my faith up 
 Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker 
 Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi 
 Survival of the fit with hope in they eye 
 Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding 
 They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them 
 Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them 
 Rock roles like a phantom 
 Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums 
 I tell them I need space like Richard Branson 
 Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars 
 And then pass out like a pamphlet 
 Never taking Grants for granted 
 It's Common, I'm high above standard 
 Fly nigga, keep my feet planted 
 To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic 
 Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic 
 I'm a dreamer 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's for the world, world, world, world, world 
 Dream on 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 He introduced me, I stepped to the podium 
 Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one 
 Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second 
 The youth, the living resurrection 
 Reflections of the sun glaring through the window 
 Now the audience staring at my mental 
 Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers 
 'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers 
 Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream 
 To be like the king that sang Billie Jean 
 Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens 
 At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream 
 To the dreamers 
  
 [Bridge] 
 If I dream you're here 
 And you dream I'm there 
 We'll be nowhere near 
 You should just come here 
 If I wake you up 
 Only difference is 
 You can live the dream 
 Just believe in it 
  
 [Maya Angelou] 
 Once you find your shoulders dropping 
 And your speech gets slow and hazy 
 You better change your way of being 
 Before you found your brain got lazy 
 You can build a better future when you join the winning team 
 If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream 
 Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you 
 Know that history holds more than it seems 
 We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream 
 From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships 
 And stood half naked on auction blocks 
 From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants 
 And were mis-named on Ellis island 
 From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops 
 From all over the world, they came to America 
 Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream 
 Let us dream for today and for tomorrow 
 Let us dare to dream[Verse 1] 
 I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred 
 What if God was a her? 
 Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her? 
 In what type of ways would I want her? 
 Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body? 
 Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly 
 If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex? 
 The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex 
 Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check 
 Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck 
 Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi' 
 Ride wit' her, cause I know for me she'd die 
 Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her 
 Couldn't be jealous cause other brothers worship her 
 Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful 
 To be in her presence I try to stay faithful 
  
 [Hook] 
 Faithful to the end 
 Faithful to the end 
 Faithful to the end 
 I'd like to be her very best friend 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend 
 Even if they don't try some ladies test men 
 And this was a test that was bigger than him 
 Some believe its the nature that is given to men 
 He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home 
 One reason or another couldn't find peace at home 
 She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?" 
 He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet" 
 "I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin' 
 Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'" 
 It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say 
 And what you did in the past you gotta live with today 
 She asked if they could spend the night together 
 He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together" 
 Went home to his lady, these were his confessions 
 "Baby you a blessin' and my best friend" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Faithful to the end 
 Faithful to the end 
 Faithful to the end 
 I'd like to be her very best friend 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Faithful to the end 
 Faithful to the end 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful 
 So, so, so 
 So, so, so 
 So faithful 
 So, so, so 
 So, so, so 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 Faithful to the end 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 Faithful to the end 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 Faithful to the end 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Produced by Kanye West]

 [Bridge: Common] 
 This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes 
 Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 And the struggles of the brothas and the folks 
 With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes 
 Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was  harder 
 Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr 
 Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga 
 While people on the low end trying to ball and get over 
 Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers 
 From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture 
 Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims 
 Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them 
 Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them 
 When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them 
 The People

 The people said that I was sharp on TV 
 At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me 
 Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie 
 He said no matter what, the people gon' see me 
 Can't leave rap alone the streets need me 
 Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me 
 Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me 
 Nobody believe, until I believe me 
 Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys 
 Visions realize, music affected lives 
 A gift from the skies, to be recognized 
 I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

 From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana 
 I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama 
 Standing in front of the judge with no honor 
 My raps ignite the people like Obama 
 The karma of the streets is needs and takes 
 Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks 
 Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake 
 Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake 
 The People

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Are we living in a dream world? 
 Are your eyes still green, girl? 
 I know your sick and tired of arguing 
 But you can't keep it bottled in 
 Jealousy, we got to swallow it 
 Your heart and mind, baby follow it 
 Smile, happiness, you could model it 
 And when you feel opposite 
 I just want you to know 
 Your whole, being is beautiful 
 I'ma do the best I can do 
 Cause I'm my best when I'm with you 
  
 [Hook: Mary J. Blige & Pharrell Williams] 
 Come close to me, baby 
 Let your love hold you 
 I know this world is crazy 
 What's it without you? 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Put down your bags, love 
 I know in the past, love 
 Has been sort of hard on you 
 But I see the God in you 
 I just want to nurture it 
 Though this love may hurt a bit 
 We dealing with this water, love 
 You even give my daughter love 
 I want to build a tribe with you 
 Protect and provide for you 
 Truth is I can't hide from you 
 The pimp in me, may have to die with you

 You helped me to discover me 
 I just want you to put trust in me 
 I kind of laugh when you cuss at me 
 The aftermath is you touching me 
 It's destiny that we connected, girl 
 You and I, we can affect the world 
 I'm tired of the fast lane 
 I want you to have my last name

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo' 
 With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals 
 The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins in 
 Yellow and pink and collared blue 
 Profiles glorifying them 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right 
 Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype 
 Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right 
 It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three stripes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this 
 The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is 
 It’s so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner[Chorus: will.i.am] 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it’s long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained, holding on 
 Cause I want you, cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I’ve been thinking bout, I’ve been thinking bout 
 I’ve been thinking bout you lately 
 Thoughts take me to when we were close 
 Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose 
 I know it’s a feeling that should be long gone 
 Things seem to come up when I hear our song 
 Golden brown girl, it seemed so long 
 Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong? 
 Emotions that, that they linger on 
 I guess cause I never knew a love so strong 
 So many hot girls, I need your warm 
 The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm 
 Good food and love I need your warm 
 This here was made before we were born 
 A dreamer so I’m a keep dreaming on 
 It’s kind of like ‘The Breakup’ with Jen and Vince Vaughn 
  
 [Chorus: will.i.am] 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it’s long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained, holding on 
 Cause I want you, cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you

 They say you don’t know, know, know what you got 
 ’Til what you got is gone 
 Yeah I like such and such, yo a lot but the feeling’s not as strong 
 We were like 2 birds that were able to fly 
 I try to pick the right words to say to the sky 
 Some days I would try but wasn’t able to cry 
 I never been good at saying goodbye 
 I take a deep breath when the times is hard 
 When I reminisce over you, my God 
 I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob 
 I guess it’s only right that I got my heart robbed 
 The scent of a room that reminds me of you 
 A hint of perfume it reminds me of you 
 Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you 
 Hope the stars and the gods align me and you 
  
 [Chorus: will.i.am] 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it’s long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained, holding on 
 Cause I want you, cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
  
 [Bridge: Common] 
 We do what we do and we do what we live 
 I love this way cause I got it as a kid 
 With so much to give from it, I never hid 
 The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared 
 My friends say it was a change for the better 
 But I say, girl you changed my forever 
 Relationships they can be as strange as the weather 
 Rain or sun we can sing this together 
  
 [Outro: will.i.am] 
 Cause I want you, cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 Cause I want you, cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you[Intro] 
 The revolution will not be televised 
 The revolution is here 
 Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier 
 We gonna help y'all see clear 
 It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all 
 Yeah, check it, yo 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels 
 It's unseen or heard, a king with words 
 Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred 
 Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured 
 Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep 
 Through me, Muhammad will forever speak 
 Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes 
 Where a man is determined by how much a man make 
 Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats 
 With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear 
 Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped 
 Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap 
 Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back 
 You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "This is rap for real, something you feel" 
 "And you know, yes you know" 
 "Rap for the black people" 
 "Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries 
 Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes 
 I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies 
 Immortalized by the realness I bring to it 
 If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music 
 My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it 
 My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it 
 Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it 
 I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions 
 More than money saved, I wanna save children 
 Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity 
 A complex man drawn off of simplicity 
 Reality is frisking me 
 This industry will make you lose intensity 
 The Common Sense in me remembers the basement 
 I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "This is rap for real, something you feel" 
 "And you know, yes you know" 
 "Rap for the black people" 
 "Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world 
 Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl 
 She recited raps, I forgot where they was from 
 In 'em, she was saying how she make brothers cum 
 I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected 
 How many dead folks this art resurrected 
 How many nations this culture connected 
 Who am I to judge one's perspective? 
 Though some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating 
 If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating 
 I just want to innovate and stimulate minds 
 Travel the world and penetrate the times 
 Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom 
 Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em 
 For now I appreciate this moment in time 
 Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "This is rap for real, something you feel" 
 "And you know, yes you know" 
 "Rap for the black people" 
 "Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy"[Verse 1] 
 Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work 
 A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt 
 Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed 
 Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors 
 The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies 
 Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me 
 My mother gave birth but she really never had me 
 Left to the hood to play daddy 
 Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae 
 With weight so they weigh they status on the streets 
 License plates that say they, motto 
 This is Chicago in the heyday 
 Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ 
 A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures 
 So many niggas, stacked upon each other 
 It's the black upon each other that we love so much 
 Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch 
 Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much 
 Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch 
 Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years 
 My college career got downed with a couple of beers 
 Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans 
 Same nigga, same block, same shit they on 
 Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome 
 In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone 
 Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands 
 My generation never understood workin' for the man 
 And, of being broke I ain't a fan 
 Now I stand in the same spot as my old man 
 My life I planned not to be on this corner 
 I still wanna see California 
 But this is my world 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's your world 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Life and death flow around us 
 Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners 
 It's hard to stay grounded 
 We stay high, that's why old folks down us 
 Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us 
 Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us 
 We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures 
 Removed from Earth, only to return through birth 
 Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth 
 Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass 
 With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed 
 She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread 
 In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads 
 Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads 
 Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt 
 She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt 
 Very well in a world where self hate is overt 
 Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike 
 She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures 
 Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her 
 In the ass, it used to be thicker 
 Life is fast, some choose to be quicker 
 I remember in high school she had a passion to sing 
 Now she see herself in a casket in dreams 
 These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack 
 Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream 
 On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme 
 In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team 
 This queen never seen herself on this Corner 
 She still wanna see California 
 But this is her world 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's your world

 Be, be here, be there, be that, be this 
 Be grateful for life, be grateful to life 
 Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000 
 Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie 
 Be little black Sambo with bad hair 
 Be aware of Willie Lynch-ism 
 Be, be boundless energy 
 Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I 
 Be a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology 
 Be food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope 
 Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful 
 Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day 
 Be peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate 
 Be high when you low, be on time but know when to go 
 Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East 
 Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves 
 Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin 
 A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer 
 A map maker, be able to find Afro-American land 
 Search thoroughly, it may be close to black land 
 Be amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human 
 Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life 
 Be cupid, to world government 
 Be found among the truth, lost tribe 
 Be at full strength when walking through the valley 
 Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top 
 Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth 
 Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King 
 Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house 
 Be... eternal[Hook: John Legend] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (They say, They say...) 
 They don't knowwwww 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 They say a nigga lost his mind 
 But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme 
 The thin line between love and hatred 
 I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life 
 They say life is what you make it 
 So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it 
 As high as the stakes get when paper get low 
 I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show" 
 Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low 
 The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough 
 They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say 
 My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray 
 Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine 
 They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes" 
 I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye 
 They never could say - tell 'em, J 
  
 [Hook] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (They say, They say...) 
 They don't knowwwww 
  
 [Verse 2: Kanye West] 
 Ahh... The sweet taste of victory 
 Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine 
 I know they sayin' "Damn, Ye snapped with this beat!" 
 Fuck you expect? I've got a history 
 Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels! 
 Haters back down, gotta be that steel! 
 I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal! 
 Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel! 
 My best friends worry bout me 
 Cause they know when you famous 
 And you had made cash 
 The media aims at us 
 And you be up so high 
 If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash 
 But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle 
 So please don't ever give me records I can't sample 
 So I could vacate where it ain't no channels 
 But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals 
 They say because of the fame and stardom 
 I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum 
 I guess it's messin with my health then 
 And this verse so crazy when I finish 
 I'm just gon check myself in - again 
  
 [Hook] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (They say, They say...) 
 They don't knowwwww 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 They say "Dude think he righteous" 
 I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers 
 Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is 
 On my paper, whether its weed or Isis 
 They say "life is a game," so I play hard 
 Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job 
 They say "Sef kept the hood together" 
 I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever" 
 Play my cards right, they say I went too left 
 They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F 
 Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights 
 Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White 
 They say my life is comparable to Christ's 
 The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice 
 They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack" 
 Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back," uh 
  
 [Hook] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (They say, They say...) 
 They don't knowwwww[Verse 1] 
 She walk into the court her knees buckle 
 Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle 
 Seen and been through struggle her whole life 
 Made a transition from being his ho to his wife 
 Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in 
 Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them 
 Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed 
  
 [Hook] 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Please let me testify 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Fear in her chest her face in tears 
 Had her man's back he was facing years 
 In her name though the place was his 
 They tryna take everything except the kids 
 For years she been through stumbling fights 
 While he tryna hustle that white 
 Up all night wondering if he's alive 
 Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed 
  
 [Hook] 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Please let me testify 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The judge yelled for order the court 
 Reporter making her words shorter 
 His lawyer sat next to him 
 She could see how the trial was affecting him 
 It hurt for her eyes to connect with him 
 Using her lies for protecting him 
 They arrested him for murder and gun possession 
 As they read back her confession, she screamed 
  
 [Hook] 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Please let me testify 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff 
 Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup 
 He stated, he was guilty on all charges 
 She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest 
 A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing 
 That's when the prosecutor realized what happened 
 All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying 
 When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin 
  
 [Hook] 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away 
 Please let me testify 
  
 [Outro] 
 You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse 
 Please let me testify, please let me testify[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Spoken] 
 I do dirt, in search of a clear mind 
 Money talk, somebody's gonna hear mine 
 Grind early before 9:30 
 Got the nine and the thirty 
 Kiss of death, you heard me? 
 My world ain't worldly, any time could be my time 
 I get high, but still ain't seen Chicago skyline 
 In my prime, stakes is high cause it's beef 
 Out here in these streets 
 Everybody tryna eat off the same plate 
 Dead presidents, we want the same face 
 And to think, me and the president, we from the same place 
 Four-hundred and twenty-one murders, ain't tryna be of the same fate 
 If I die and go to heaven, will I make it through the main gate? 
  
 [Intro: Common] 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom 
 Ooh

 Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Second row of the church with my hood on 
 My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on 
 At his funeral, listening to this church song 
 His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for ‘em 
 A cold world that’s why we pack heaters 
 Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us 
 I’mma need to go back, I gots to get 'em 
 Back and forth in these streets, that’s the rhythm 
 Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord 
 When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can’t afford not to hit him 
 Shots ripping through his True Religion denim 
 These streets was my religion 
 I stood over him, his life is over then 
 Now these keys got me locked up with older men 
 Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz 
 They ended up being the keys for my life to end

 My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight 
 Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait 
 I was hurtin', couldn't get no work 
 You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt 
 You said that the last shall be first 
 Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth? 
 My whole life I had to worry about eatin’ 
 I ain’t have time to think about what I believe in 
 When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come? 
 I’m coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son 
 And I don’t want my ways following him, the streets swallowing him 
 And I don’t want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him 
 Hope it’s the good things, ‘til life was over is when I understood things 
 Standing at the gates ‘cause I know you’ve forgiven what I’ve done 
 I’m your son, do I have the keys to get in? 
  
 [Hook: Common]

 [Verse 3: Vince Staples] 
 Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe 
 My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas 
 See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever’s on your plate 
 Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet 
 Tryna hop the gate to heaven ‘cause I couldn’t get a key 
 But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own 
 Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free 
 We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water 
 Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father 
 Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver 
 Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler 
 Tell ‘em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar 
 So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though 
 Another motherfucker out of control 
 Just walking my soles low, lit up with the abuse 
 They wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used 
 See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news 
 Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues 
 Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew 
 If you ain’t from around here you get gunned down here 
 Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys 
 To the kingdom

 We were from different cities on the same block 
 Grew up in different circles in the same spot 
 Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all 
 Showing her ring off like a player at the ball 
 I recall the walls that I had up 
 Attracted to women for things that didn't matter 
 Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop 
 The night that I met her, it might be forever 
 I hear people saying that they like us together 
 I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better 
 With you, I admit I had issues 
 Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence 
 It's more than clothes can say for you 
 When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you 
 I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust 
 And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust 
 From the cloth 
  
 [Hook] 
 Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare 
 That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear 
 Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear 
 But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh 
 La la la la, la la la la 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug 
 Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs 
 You were there when my cuz passed away 
 Not only does love, but life hatches day 
 I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you 
 Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you 
 Looking at things that we've been through 
 Things that seem simple 
 I know when to go hard and when to be gentle 
 Sentimental laughs and expressions 
 Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing 
 You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked 
 The truth we address it, that's so unexpected 
 Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead 
 Your hunger for affection will always be fed 
 Thank God we never sped and let love take its course 
 Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource 
 The cloth 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Hey lover we can cover each other 
 Through the coldest nights, tight never smother 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's the cloth 
  
 [Hook][Produced by: No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in 
 That be scatterin' 
 Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen 
 It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine 
 I grab the men, verbally badgering broads 
 I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP 
 I went against all odds and got a even steven 
 Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin' 
 But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise 
 I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize 
 I analyze where I rest my eyes 
 And chastise the best of guys with punchlines 
 I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time 
 For your mind like one time 
 If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine 
 'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times 
 Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine 
 I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine 
 Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit 
 This rap shit is truly outta control 
 My style is too developed to be arrested 
 It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole 
 They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell 
 I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail 
 A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury 
 I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me 
 Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints 
 They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light 
 I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight 
 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight 
 I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright 
 Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights 
 Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes 
 In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades 
 (Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made 
 I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums 
 Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums 
 Had to halt with the, malt liquor 
 'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas 
 Now my speech and thoughts quicker 
 Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 UAC got my back and we don't, now check it 
 I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga 
 When it's my turn to go, I gotta go 
 And I'm gone with the storm 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
 "Resurrection"[Verse 1: Common] 
 Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from 
 Barren souls, heroic songs unsung 
 Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone 
 Tied with the rope that my grandmother died 
 Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions 
 Since slave days separating, fathers from children 
 Institution ain't just a building 
 But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them 
 We ain't seen as human beings with feelings 
 Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing! 
 For now we know, the new Jim Crow 
 They stop, search and arrest our souls 
 Police and policies patrol philosophies of control 
 A cruel hand taking hold 
 We let go to free them so we can free us 
 America's moment to come to Jesus 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 Freedom (Freedom) 
 Freedom come (Freedom come) 
 Hold on (Hold on) 
 Won't be long (Won't be long) 
 Freedom (Freedom) 
 Freedom come (Freedom come) 
 Hold on (Hold on) 
 Won't be long (Won't be long) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The caged birds sings for freedom to ring 
 Black bodies being lost in the American dream 
 Blood of black being, a pastoral scene 
 Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13 
 Now whips and chains are subliminal 
 Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal' 
 Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country 
 Shot me with your ray-gun 
 And now you want to trump me 
 Prison is a business, America's the company 
 Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering 
 We staring in the face of hate again 
 The same hate they say will make America great again 
 No consolation prize for the dehumanized 
 For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives 
 And we gonna free them, so we can free us 
 America's moment to come to Jesus 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 Freedom (Freedom) 
 Freedom come (Freedom come) 
 Hold on (Hold on)

 Everybody home, ain't nobody gone 
 And I got all my niggas around

 And I got all my niggas around 
 I got a couple minutes in town 
 A couple hundred bitches around 
 So baby go on and get us a round 
 Cause I got all my niggas around 
 Celebrate 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 We partying, yeah got body and 
 Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian 
 Fly, we live it 'til we die 
 We living in the night looking in the eye 
 On our paper 'til we get it like Dubai 
 Chi niggas stand up, plastic cups 
 Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks 
 It don't stop here 
 Bottles of Veuve pop here 
 And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here 
 Celebrate like it's new year 
 Some bomb broads coming, type nuclear 
 Yeah, it's so ridiculo 
 Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go 
 Backwards liquor store 
 Celebrate 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody home, ain't nobody gone 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 I got a couple minutes in town 
 A couple hundred bitches around 
 So baby go on and get us a round 
 Cause I got all my niggas around 
 Celebrate 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic 
 My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with 
 This raw bitch came in looking flawless 
 Tonight she'll be giving conscious, headlights! 
 Beaming from the Bimmer that her momma bought her 
 I got to act right for her like I'm an author 
 Look where drama brought us, look where karma brought us 
 Married to the game, like Usher we was caught up 
 Now we got some R&B broads we can call up 
 You niggas come around keep the wall up 
 Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things 
 Hustlers from the go, how far we done came 
 Celebrate 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody home, ain't nobody gone 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 I got a couple minutes in town 
 A couple hundred bitches around 
 So baby go on and get us a round 
 Cause I got all my niggas around 
 Celebrate 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Ah, another night, we love the night 
 For the life, getting bugged tonight 
 Wait 'til I get my money right 
 Told you it's gonna be on like the business that we lean on 
 Put my team on, get our heat on 
 Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay 
 My niggas move work even on a holiday 
 We come from porches and alleyways 
 I'm the big ticket, don't need no one to validate 
 You celebrate 
  
 [Bridge] 
 We ain't gotta wait 
 It's a toast to you and me 
 Bills ain't so bad, celebrate that 
 Party in the yard 'til the lights come on 
 Ain't nobody crying 
 We've come so far, been climbing 
 Now the clouds they passed us by 
 C'mon and raise your glass up high 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Everybody home, ain't nobody gone 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 I got a couple minutes in town 
 A couple hundred bitches around 
 So baby go on and get us a round 
 Cause I got all my niggas around 
 Celebrate[Hook: John Legend] 
 I believe in the light that shines and will never die 
 Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive 
 They will talk about us 
 Like they talked about the kings before us 
 They will talk about us 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 These are the words of a believer 
 Achiever, leader of the globe 
 Feeding souls of those in need 
 I bleed the blood of the struggle 
 Walking over troubled puddles 
 Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress 
 Extremities of life and it's process 
 Birth of a son, death of another 
 With love I caress both mothers 
 And told 'em, who’s in control is the one that's above us 
 I walk where money talks and love stutters 
 Body language of a nation going through changes 
 The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger 
 Anger gets sent through the chamber 
 It’s tough when your own look like strangers 
 We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers 
 If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us? 
 Look at the picture, hard not to blame us 
 But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often 
 Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them? 
 Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking? 
 Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em? 
 Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em 
 Real talking, in they ear like a walkman 
 Thoughts spin around the corner to the world 
 When I see them, I see my baby girl 
 Believe! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The lord lives among us, the younguns hunger 
 Become a means to get it by any ways nece- 
 -ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser 
 With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors 
 Destiny’s children survivors, soldiers 
 In front of buildings they eyes look older 
 Hard to see blessings in the violent culture 
 Face against weapons, sirens, holsters 
 That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us 
 Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah 
 We go from being Precious to Oprah 
 Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas 
 Today and the way that you can see we determined 
 Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning 
 Lesson’s in our life are like stripes that we earning 
 Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning 
 Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light 
 For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys 
 Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest 
 That seems beyond us, even through the unseen 
 I know that God watches 
 From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us 
 The prophets, nothing can stop us 
 Believe!

 [Intro: Big Sean] 
 Ohh 
 Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin’ 
 Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’ 
 Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ 
 Nooo 
 Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’ 
 Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’ 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day 
 Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet 
 I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play 
 Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay 
 What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day 
 That means to shine, you find a way 
 Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways 
 Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley 
 Champagne ambitions 
 I pour it out for my man who made  his transition 
 Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego 
 Born to fly, call me the bald eagle 
 Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though 
 Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin 
 The hero that came from zero 
 My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico 
 This bra from the DR said I was frío 
 That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo 
 Pinot noir style, better with time 
 I’m gambling with watches getting better with time 
 So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me 
 They say “time is money”, forever is my salary 
 I shine tomorrow with what I do today 
 Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display 
  
 [Hook: Big Sean] 
 Ohh 
 Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin’ 
 Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’ 
 Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ 
 Nooo 
 Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’ 
 Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’ 
 Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin' 
 Nooo 
  
 [Bridge: Big Sean] 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

 Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day 
 Tryna get it every way, every day, ay ay 
 Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Bars in alignment, stars in alignment 
 Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds 
 Evolve from the science, power and refinement 
 Read between the lines, hard to define us 
 Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us 
 In the Benz leaning like we biased 
 I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me 
 You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash 
 The moment is to live it like your last 
 Moments that we have never living in the last 
 My time, man, precious like diamonds 
 Look through the glass, see what I magnify man 
 I'mma be shining 'til I die man 
 I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man 
 Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day 
 To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K 
 47 to 87 to the hundreds 
 Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted 
 Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity 
 Between peace and prosperity, so marry me 
 Diamonds 
  
 [Verse 3: Big Sean] 
 Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway 
 I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day 
 Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days 
 I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway” 
 Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away 
 Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808 
 Said you can’t take his chain away 
 Real player you can’t take this game away 
 Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller 
 But you can’t take my dame away 
 Devil in a red dress, but she got that angel face 
 I could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day 
 The G code is my combination 
 Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces 
 Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases 
 Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation 
 Diamonds 
 Diamonds[Produced by Dug Infinite] 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Real nigga quotes I tote 
 Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote 
 Legendary like The Goat, who got game? 
 Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes 
 My album, niggas was expecting, now my water broke 
 Before it, I was sort of broke 
 Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope 
 Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke 
 You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope 
 At the end of the road trip still, I'mma hold shit down like syndrome 
 Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home 
 Barely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone 
 You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga get gone 
 Fuck the wind storm, my pen told the street folklore 
 Body language spoke raw 
 Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war 
 Stand out like cold sores, claim you hard but you ho-core 
 George Bush and CIA you moving O's for 
 I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours 
  
 [Chorus: Dug Infinite] 
 Com got rhymes, Dug make beats 
 Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet 
 You know the shit be real 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Chicka-chicka-M chicka-C chicka-M am I 
 People call me Com and collective with perspective 
 I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds 
 Bomb like 'Nam sound, tell your bitch to calm down 
 Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off 
 I'm ill, raps I spit as if I had a bad cough 
 This crank nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off 
 Playing yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off 
 More heart than an artery, jones in my bones 
 To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama 
 If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy 
 Shit is real like a station property, crew is forming colonies 
 Commonly, I hear these rats thinking they mahogany 
 On every rap hook, sounding like a dog to me 
 In a reservoir, I flow and go 
 On and on, like Erykah or etcetera 
 Designated not to make hits but hit home 
 Out of proportion, hit makers get blown 
  
 [Chorus: Dug Infinite] 
 Com got rhymes, Dug make beats 
 Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet 
 You know the shit be real 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 R&B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads 
 Love songs is violent, them niggas whole style is silent 
 I hate to staple the singers together 
 But in my head it's been ringing forever 
 And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye 
 While all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me 
 Emcees be insecure, like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs 
 If I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob 
 Bukeing niggas and pulling broads is they apparent job 
  
 [Chorus: Dug Infinite] 
 Com got rhymes, Dug make beats 
 Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet 
 You know the shit be real 
 Com got rhymes, Dug make beats 
 Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet 
 You know the shit be real[Hook x2: Will.I.Am] (Sample from Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech) 
 (I have a dream) I got a dream 
 (That one day) We gonna work it out 
 (That one day) We gonna work it out 
 (That one day) We gonna work it out 
  
 (I have a dream) I got a dream 
 (That one day) That one day 
 (That one day) I'm a look deep within myself, I gotta find a way 
 (I have a dream) 
  
 [Bridge: Will.I.Am] 
 My dream is to be free 
 My dream is to be... 
 My dream is to be... 
 My dream is to be free 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness 
 Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives 
 Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness 
 Given this game with no time to practice 
 Born on the black list, told I'm below average 
 A life with no cabbage 
 That's no money if you from where I'm from 
 Funny, I just want some of your sun 
 Dark clouds seem to follow me 
 Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology 
 I walk with a boulder on my shoulder 
 It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier 
 Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King 
 I ain't using it for the right thing 
 In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes 
 I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The world see me lookin' in the mirror 
 Images of me, gettin' much clearer 
 Dear self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul 
 If I don't express it, then forever I hold 
 Inside, I'm from the side where we out of control 
 Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role 
 My story like yours, yo it gotta be told 
 Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role 
 Where it scrolls and stow slaves, and Jewish people in cold cage 
 Hate has no color or age 
 Flip the page, now my race became freedom 
 Write dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em 
 I believe in heaven more than hell, lessons more than jail 
 In the ghetto, let love prevail with a story to tell 
 My eyes see the glory, and well 
 The world waiting for me to yell "I Have a Dream" 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge][Intro: Common] 
 Yo, we gotta start respectin' life more y'all 
 You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself 
 Gotta see the God within him 
 We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin' 
 We losin' too many of ours 
 Gotta recreate y'all 
 Yo, check it 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours? 
 Cause I created you, irresponsibly 
 Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of 
 The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world 
 Had myself believin' I was sterile 
 I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl 
 Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb 
 But she and I agree, a seed we don't need 
 You would've been much more than a mouth to feed 
 But someone, I would've fed this information I read 
 To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave 
 Instead I lead you to death 
 I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry 
 But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially 
 Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me 
 Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family 
 I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma 
 Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father 
 For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do 
 For me to live forever I can only do that through you 
 Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun 
 Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son 
 I could have sacrificed goin' out 
 To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control 
 Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul 
 315 dollars ain't worth your soul 
 315 dollars ain't worth it 
  
 [Chorus: Lauryn Hill] 
 I never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
 You said you would be here when it rained 
 Why didn't you stay 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself 
 You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt 
 But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are 
 Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination 
 An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation 
 Back and forth my feelings was pacin' 
 Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it 
 But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it 
 Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust 
 Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust 
 Or is it that we don't trust each other enough 
 And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together 
 Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better 
 Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together 
 We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives 
 It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives 
 I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding 
 But I want our parenthood to come from planning 
 It's so much in my life that's undone 
 We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one 
 If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from 
 But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God 
 So I can, discipline my son with my rod 
 Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed 
 Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame 
 I had a book of African names, case our minds changed 
 You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy 
 So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy 
  
 [Chorus: Lauryn Hill] 
 I never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
 You said you would be here when it rained 
 Why didn't you stay 
 I never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
 Now the situations made things change 
 Why didn't you stay[Verse 1: Common] 
 Here we go, here, here we go again 
 Trayvon'll never get to be an older man 
 Black children, they childhood stole from them 
 Robbed of our names and our language, stole again 
 Who stole the soul from black folk? 
 Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke 
 And made the whip crackle on our back slow 
 And made us go through the back door 
 And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks 
 Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots 
 Leaving our own to lay in a box 
 Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot 
 We kill each other, it's part of the plot 
 I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us 
 I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us 
 These are the things we gotta discuss 
 The new plantation, mass incarceration 
 Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids 
 As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is 
 Is it a felony or a misdemeanor? 
 Maria Sharapova making more than Serena 
 It took Viola Davis to say this 
 The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us 
 We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers 
 The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar 
 And greasy foods; I don't believe the news 
 Or radio, stereotypes we refuse 
 Brainwashed in the cycle to spin 
 We write our own story, black America again 
  
 [Sample: James Brown] 
 You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is lettin' a person feel that they're important. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from… 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Hot damn, black America again 
 Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind 
 The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin 
 The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been 
 The hate the hate made, I inherited from them 
 But I ain't gon' point the finger 
 We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie 
 Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me 
 Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac? 
 Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at? 
 Endangered in our own habitat 
 The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back 
 As a matter of fact, we them lab rats 
 You build the projects for, now you want your hood back 
 I guess if you could rap, you would express it too 
 That PTSD, we need professionals 
 You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust 
 From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us 
 Tell your political parties invite us 
 Instead of making voting laws to spite us 
 You know, you know we from a family of fighters 
 Fought in your wars and our wars 
 You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two 
 And then, maybe then we'll believe you 
 See black people in the future 
 We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya 
 We hold these truths to be self-evident 
 All men and women are created equal 
 Including black Americans 
  
 [Sample: James Brown] 
 You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight 
 Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait 
 I was hurtin', couldn't get no work 
 You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt 
 You said that the last shall be first 
 Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth? 
 My whole life I had to worry about eatin’ 
 I ain’t have time to think about what I believe in 
 When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come? 
 I’m coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son 
 And I don’t want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him 
 And I don’t want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him 
 Hope it’s the good things, ‘til life was over is when I understood things 
 Standing at the gates ‘cause I know you’ve forgiven what I’ve done 
 I’m your son, do I have the keys to get in? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Vince Staples] 
 Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe 
 My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas 
 See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever’s on your plate 
 Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet 
 Tryna hop the gate to heaven ‘cause I couldn’t get a key 
 But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own 
 Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free 
 We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water 
 Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father 
 Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver 
 Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler 
 Tell ‘em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar 
 So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though 
 Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low 
 Lit up with the abuse, they wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used 
 See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news 
 Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues 
 Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew 
 If you ain’t from around here you get gunned down here 
 Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys 
 To the kingdom 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Electronica] 
 Nas hit me up on the phone like "Peace, Isa 
 You know you need to preach how the pyramids of Giza 
 Alone condemn Easter 
 Instead of sniffing lines, popping thongs in Ibiza, Ether 
 Nigga, are we not thy brother's keeper?" 
 Allahu Akbar, abracadabra 
 We used what we had to stay alive like MacGyver 
 Started from the bottom, now we really, really here 
 Started kinda blurry, now we really, really clear 
 It's the Nat King unforgettable, black king on a pedestal 
 The way he made words into edibles was incredible 
 Verbs and spices, giving life out to the lifeless 
 Giving Christ out to the Christ-less 
 My handle with the dices been documented as priceless 
 I roll 7's naturally 
 Devils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally 
 Rappers I gave birth to shot at the God, blasphemy 
 Told these motherfuckers to never Jimmy DeGrassi me 
 This goes out to those that choose to use 
 Disrespectful views on original Jews 
 The chosen people of God getting slandered and abused 
 In the streets and the news by the seed of Yakub 
 The synagogues of Satan wanna keep us confused 
 That's how we lose, niggas got the ill street blues 
 From Chiraq to England 
 Me and Common dropping bombs like the baby planes as we establish the kingdom[Common] 
 Dem boy wanna talk like dem wanna gon come 
 But what you gon' do if you got one gun? 
 I sing a song for the hero unsung 
 With faces on the mural of the revolution 
 No looking back, cause in back is what's done 
 Tell the preacher God got more than one son 
 Tell the law my Uzi weighs a ton 
 I walk like a warrior from them I won't run 
 On the streets they try to beat us like a drum 
 In Cincinnati, another brother hung 
 Again he won't see the sun, with his family stung 
 They want us to hold justice, but you handin' me none 
 The same they did Kobe and Michael Jackson 
 Make them the main attraction 
 Turn around and attack them 
 Black gem in the rough, you rugged enough 
 Use your mind and non power, get the government touch 
 Them boy chat chat on how him pop gun 
 I got the black strap to make the cops run 
 They watching me, I'm watching them 
 Them dick boys got a lotta cock in them 
 My people on the block got a lotta Pac in them 
 And when we roll together, we be rocking them 
 To sleep 
 No time for that, cause there's things to be done 
 Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come 
 From project building, seen a fiend being hung 
 With that happening, why they messing with Saddam? 
 Burn a bush, cause for peace he no push no button 
 Killing over oil and grease, no weapons of destruction 
 How can we follow leader when this a corrupt one? 
 The government's a G-Unit and they might buck young 
 Black people in the urban area one 
 I hold up a peace sign but I carry a gun 
 Peace y'all, love[Hook: Scratches of Kanye West and Common]

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me 
 Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me 
 I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap 
 It ain't ninety-fo' Joe, we can't go back 
 The game need a makeover 
 My man retired, I'mma takeover 
 Tell these halftime niggas break's over 
 I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda 
 Too many rape the culture 
 Leave rappers with careers and they faith over 
 It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier 
 In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra- 
 Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black 
 I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that 
 I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack 
 And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap 
 Inspired by black Muslims and Christians 
 Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions 
 In the conditions of the city, the city 
 The city, the city, the city, the city 
 Come on

 [Verse 2: Common] 
 A black figure...in the middle with chaos and gunfire 
 So many raps about rims, surprised niggas ain't become tires 
 On the street you turn cold and then go screech 
 I tell 'em "fuck 'em" like I do to police 
 The beast is runnin' rampant 
 I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric 
 For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem 
 You spit hot garbage son of Sanford 
 What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich? 
 I slap a nigga like you, and tell him "Rick James bitch!" 
 With your Hollywood stories, on porches 
 We polly hood stories about who became rich 
 And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch 
 You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch 
 I'm forever puttin' words together 
 Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons 
 The name Com', has never been involved wit' run 
 Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free 
 I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary 
 Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry 
 They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicagoan 
 Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin' 
 It's the city, the city y'all, the city 
 Uh, the city y'all, come on

 La, la, la, la, la and everybody say 
 La, la, la, la, la I know you, I know you 
  
 [Kanye West] 
 I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be 
 Armor All flow cause it never get rusty 
 I ain't gotta say it, man, dog, trust me 
 Bust somebody head, GLC, where was we 
 Still rock the Prada, 'fore that, rock the Starter 
 Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder 
 Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up 
 Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars 
 I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars 
 Burn CDs with no regard for the stars 
 Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours 
 Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas 
 Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods 
 We eatin' Joe, you still talkin' no carbs 
 A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

 Your fly is open, McFly 
 The crowd is open, I think I know why 
 I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes 
 And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi 
 Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon 
 I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons 
 Look at that neutron on his green like croutons 
 People asking him, "do you have any Grey Poupon?"

 You in the building but the building's falling 
 You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding 
 My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans 
 Bout to school y'all niggas, you should call him August 
 I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving 
 Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin' 
 If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin 
 With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 4: Kanye West] 
 With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera 
 Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas 
 Can't wait till they say, "Ye ran up at the Oscars" 
 Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie 
 Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta 
 Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza 
 But this is for the mobsters, Holla 
 We some true Chi-town legends, accept no imposters 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 5: Common] 
 The un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel 
 Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples 
 Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle 
 You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle 
 Caught a case of robbery, and beat it, like Michael 
 Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku 
 I write to do the right thing, like Spike do 
 Through conflicts that's crucial and drama that's psycho

 Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit 
 It's the Thelonious, super microphonist 
 You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it 
 You know it, these Mini-Me's trying to clone us 
 I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us 
 I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us 
 It's the Thelonious, super microphonist 
  
 [Verse 2: T3] 
 Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat 
 Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet 
 Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast 
 Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me 
 Right, gotta make money all my life 
 Gotta stay fucking bitches many types 
 Yeah you know what I'm talking bout 
 Yup, stay turning these bitches out 
 Dick em down also dick em out 
 Throw something down whenever my dick's out 
 They know me so they restructure and reroute 
 They know me from Washington to down South 
 All the way to London to my nigga Common house, right 
 It's like a game we never play out, out, out, out 
  
 [Hook 1: J Dilla] 
 Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out 
 Word up, just be about what you about dogg 
 Knowhatimsayin, just play at your own risk 
 Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit 
 It's the Thelonious, super microphonist 
 You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it 
 You know it, cause you can feel it in your throat, say it 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 I'm bout to let my mind float 
 (Com, say it) 
 Get your third eye poked 
 Fuck game, I assemble dope 
 Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess 
 Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test 
 You can feel it in your chest 
 Your B I, feel it in her breasts 
 Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced 
 We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us 
 Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild 
 Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style 
 Inviting wack niggas to dinner 
 I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga 
 Who can take it where I take it 
 You better goin to God like Mase did 
 Leaving crowds complacent 
 I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit 
 Or thug style you can feel it in your body 
 Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body 
  
 [Hook 2: J Dilla] 
 Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body 
 You don't want it, need to find your ass a hobby 
 Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us 
 You know us, Thelonious, super microphone 
 You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real 
  
 [Verse 4: Baatin] 
 Ay, it's like a ritual 
 You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place 
 With the grace, nevertheless, I stress 
 Let the music put a smile on your face 
 As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence 
 You know I always leave you with the taste 
 I know you like it hard to the core 
 That's what you ask for, you aching for the best 
 Hurtin like a sore in that ass, like a ritual 
 Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry 
 I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise 
 But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die 
 So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth 
 Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth 
 It's like a verse you could never read out of a book 
 Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook 
 Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day 
 Pay attention to your art, never go astray 
 Word is bond 
  
 [Verse 5: J Dilla] 
 Yo we do it and we don't quit 
 Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious 
 Owning this rap shit, super microphonist and we known to spit 
 I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did 
 I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkist 
 You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless 
 Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines 
 I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme, nine-nines busting plus 
 Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex 
 You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks 
 Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket 
 Connant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets 
 Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all 
 They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time 
 We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines 
 Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports 
 We gettin money a long time and y'all short 
 My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall 
 You funny duke, cause really you think you can do me 
 When you roll a 500 that's really a 320 
 Should of let somebody else hook it 
 Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it 
 I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate 
 That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday 
 Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back 
 Show you the definition of a payback[Intro: Nina Simone] 
 Baby, you understand me now 
 If sometimes you see that I'm mad 
 No one can always be an angel 
 When everything goes wrong you see some bad 
 Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
  
 [Common] 
 Yeah, uh (Misunderstood) 
 We do this, for the people that walk that path 
 Tryna get to their dream, yeah, uh (oh) 
  
 He stood on the corner with the rest of them 
 Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him 
 Hard streets and a life that crested him 
 Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin 
 He knew the President wadn't addressin him 
 Though dead presidents was undressin him 
 Two kids from hot sex no protection and 
 People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em 
 It get hard to get the get the God question in 
 Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin 
 He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em 
 Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him 
 He on the ground he could feel God touching him 
 He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him 
 At heaven's gate, saying Lord please let me in 
 Or send me back to tell my people to be better men 
  
 [Hook: Nina Simone] 
 Misunderstood 
 Cause we are - Misunderstood 
 Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood 
 I'm just human, oh 
  
 [Common] 
 Uh, yeah 
 She dancin she dance she dance for them 
 Her body move but her mind was manic'n 
 Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been 
 Relationships with men have been so damagin 
 She thought back to when she was at Howard and 
 Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and 
 Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them 
 The ones that make it always ain't the talented 
 Some dreams get lost never to be found again 
 At first strippin seemed so empowerin 
 Most every girl wanna do it now and then 
 But bein meat every day is devourin 
 Cats puttin paper where she put powder and 
 Life would break her, now she powderin 
 She was high when she fell down and then 
 Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and 
 She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and 
 Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then 
 Talked to God, feeling like his child again 
 Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Vamp: Bilal] 
 The life we lead, will always lead us 
 And we pray that he, will never leave us 
 It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason 
 Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus [2x] 
  
 Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood 
 Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood 
 I'm just human[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Uh, yeah 
 Made in Black America, metaphor for a predator 
 Been to the Mediterranean, on my papers like a editor 
 I flow like a reservoir, dog 
 Rap Tarantino, off the chain like Django 
 Still let the chain glow, where they bang though 
 And niggas get shot like camera angles 
 In rap videos put up on Vimeo 
 I'm where the buck 50 bicentennial perennial all-star 
 Fruit that don't fall far from Islam 
 When rap is dead, I had the fluid, that embalm 
 I speak, you know I'm in the building like an intercom 
 Enter Com, the world's most 
 Intricate, integrated with imminent 
 Domain, I'm feeling myself like a sentimen- 
 -Tal letter written to myself 
 Aspirin' for greatness, wellness and wealth, I'm cold, I'm hard to melt 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Uhh, I'm more than a hot song, or a hot album 
 Ask my ex, I still live on like Malcolm 
 My spirit and style done a transformation 
 Make room, nigga I don't need reservations 
 You sweet as a hotel, I stay presidential 
 Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you 
 To rearrange the mental, I've seen things we've been through 
 It's hard for a man to claim gentile, let me change the tempo 
 I be with broads that got they shit together 
 Even if it ain't meant forever, still smoke the spliff together 
 The essence of the herbs, the presence of the words 
 Yeah you got a chest but I'm treasurin' your curves 
 You walk past, I'ma look behind you 
 Look you up and down to find you 
 Can see I was designed to, give you power and refine you 
 You fucking with me we can grind to 
 Gather the better Black America 
  
 [Verse 3: Ab-Soul] 
 Yeah, made in Black America, takin' threats from a terrorist 
 We will never meet but the media feed hysteria 
 And I be inferior, if I be in fear of ya 
 More godly than gluttonous but my supper's superior 
 You know the difference 'tween the kids with the lunch tickets 
 And the ones with the money, in the cafeteria 
 I break bread with with my brethren like a pizzeria 
 Spinnin' dough, you'll find red dots over cheese, be a- 
 -Ware of your whereabouts, don't be feeble 
 I'm pissed off, tinkle is the onomatopoeia 
 You's just a little star (twinkle) sure ain't me 
 Been a superstar since ma made me 
 My president is black (uhh) 
 I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast? 
 I don't give a fuck, shit, my grandpa glad 
 They pass that gun law or not, niggas still gon' pop up dead 
  
 [Verse 4: Ab-Soul] 
 Yeah, I'm the Morpheus in this hip-hop matrix, exposin' fake shit 
 Used to borrow dollars, now my sense ain't so common 
 Went across the whole nation screamin' Hiiipower (HiiiPower) 
 Never been a racist, but I love horsepower 
 I'm hot, that's why I got the fans in the stands 
 Em fans googlin', enemies shakin' hands 
 Restorin' the balance, detourin' the malice 
 We kill you motherfuckin' mice with a mallet (uhh) 
 This is Huey P Newton with a QP 
 Bobby with a Seale, Fred Hampton on pills 
 In the Hamptons, now that's ill, what's happenin'? 
 I'm just trying to teach my homies 'bout the Emerald tablets 
 Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal 
 Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia 
 To the nation's capital, Golf Wang radical 
 Black Lip Pastor, tip the usher when he pass ya, nigga 
 Welcome to Black America, Soul![Intro: Common] 
 After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world 
 About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows? 
 Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves 
 So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn 
 Began, began with time 
 Being my bloodline is one with the divine 
 In time brother, you will discover the light 
 Some say that God is Black and the devil's White 
 Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right 
 I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear 
 The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear 
 As a child, given religion with no answer to why 
 Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die 
 Curiosity killed the catechism 
 Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to 
 And became a slave to master self 
 A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health 
 My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons 
 Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital 
 And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys 
 You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief 
 But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
 And use religion as an emblem 
 When it should be a natural way of life 
 Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right 
 That's who got you doing right and got you this far 
 Whether you say "in Jesus name" or "Hum do Allah" 
 Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you 
 You let that show towards others in the things you do 
 'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne 
 Only 144,000 gon' get home 
 Only 144,000 gon' get home 
 Only 144,000 gon' get it, baby 
  
 [Hook: Cee-Lo] 
 I've lived and I've learned 
 I have taken and I've earned 
 I have laughed, I've cried 
 I have failed and I have tried 
 Sunshine, pouring rain 
 Found joy through all my pain 
 I just wanna be happy with being me 
  
 [Verse 2: Cee-Lo] 
 Let me voice my concern 
 So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn 
 Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
 Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
 I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
 'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place 
 So I try to find the clue in you 
 But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do 
 Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden 
 Damn, something in me wanna know who I am 
 So I began my search, my journey started in church 
 It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief 
 Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
 Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
 And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
 It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal 
 Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
 Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
 Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
 Some leads were granted with insight 
 And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand 
 He still created with the imperfection of man 
 So, with following I disagree 
 By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but 
 I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
 That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas 
 You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity 
 But one side you gonna have to choose 
 Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse 
 So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
 Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson 
 If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown 
 If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
 If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
 If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
  
 [Hook] 
 I've lived and I've learned 
 I have taken and I've earned 
 I have laughed, I've cried 
 I have failed and I have tried 
 Sunshine, pouring rain 
 Found joy through all my pain 
 I just wanna be happy with being me[Hook] 
 {Double Trouble sample: here's a little that must be told 
 (*beat scratches*) 
 From beginning to end (*beat scratches*) 
 Here's a little story that must be told (*beat scratches*) 
 From beginning to end} 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I got so much trouble on my mind 
 So I take time out my day 
 To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep 
 Hopin' that I keep my soul 
 Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world 
 And I ain't even got a bomber 
 Livin' with my momma, it's the same routine 
 Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things 
 But ain't shit to do 
 I'm twenty-two, catch 
 In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife 
 I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled 
 Tryin' to find me some light 
 In the rim of darkness, I too sing 
 I may not be the darkest, brother 
 But I was always told to act my age, not my color 
 Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original 
 So now I sing the new negro spiritual 
 It goes, 'get up, stand up 
 Stand up for your rights 
 Get up, stand up 
 Don't give up the fight 
 It's like, how can you understand the pain 
 When you never had to stand under the rain? 
 When it rains, it pours 
 And it's about to come down hard, thank God 
 I found you 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 {Double Trouble: here's a little story that must be told} (*beat scratches*)

 {Double Trouble: from beginning to end} 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 As I walk down the road of existence 
 I get resistance from all angles 
 I tangle for cash 
 Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week 
 But all I eat is fast food 
 And you know how junk food goes right through ya 
 So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way back 
 I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack 
 Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back 
 To get some more 
 Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...) 
 And I can't turn around, brew- I can't turn it down 
 Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up 
 It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up 
 One day 
 I'm cruisin' down a one-way street 
 And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago 
 It itself, life is an obstacle 
 As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible 
 I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?) 
 I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum 
 What makes it bad, I had incentive 
 But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated 
 I procrastinated 
 I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed 
 I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold 
 What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand 
 And I had a plan 
 But things didn't go through 
 The way they were supposed to 
 Thank God I found you

 [Verse 3] 
 It's like a jungle, sometimes 
 It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, I ponder 
 And try to keep my 
 Concentration In this idiotic nation 
 They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience 
 Adjacent to that situation 
 I want an occupation that I'm into 
 Cause yet have I begin to 
 Live to my potential, I went to 
 School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience, I reminisce 
 And wish, I could go back in time to eighty-nine 
 When there was just' 'sunshine' 
 But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress 
 I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace 
 Of mind, and find who I am 
 But thank God I found you

 Bow! Bow! I came through the door 
 With the raw Martin Margiela 
 Superstar status, everything stellar 
 With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers 
 Niggas already jealous 
 We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers 
 She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous 
 Go to the bar to get around like a propeller 
 The barmaid's name is Stella 
 I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me 
 Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party 
 Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah 
 Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah 
 Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah 
 Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha 
 Hmmmm! Well let me take my time 
 She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight 
 Seen that ass cause I got hindsight 
 She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight 
 'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt 
 She said "You rap?" Yea mummy 
 I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money 
  
 [Hook] 
 Feels so good 
 I wanna touch somebody 
 So let's go, go 
 Wanna feel you close, keep touching 
 Feels so good 
 I wanna touch somebody 
 So let's go, go 
 Wanna feel you close, keep touching

 [Verse 2] 
 She was all couture, in a Tom Ford 
 Security guard let me in cause I'm lord 
 Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress 
 Code is to always stay fresh 
 Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast 
 She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest 
 This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess 
 Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled 
 I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove 
 I won't have to take it back to high school 
 Rewind! No need to take me back in time 
 Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline 
 Cause what's in front of me is this behind 
 Up north, she's thick; down south she's fine 
 Tuned in to what I'm doing 
 I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing 
 The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade 
 Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me 
 Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady 
 Dude got foul like crack in the 80s 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo 
 You never know who got a Tec up in the disco 
 "You Hollywood." Nah nigga, I'm Chicago 
 So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle 
  
 [Hook] 
 Feels so good

 So let's go, go 
 Wanna feel you close, keep touching

 So we made it to this same end of the road 
 And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold 
 How I made it out with my soul 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people 
 These are adventures of young black millionaires 
 I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged 
 The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this 
 On the move like black slaves through the wilderness 
 I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases 
 When I was born, three wise men came to visit us 
 One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner 
 They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts 
 You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this 
 Show the walking dead who the true and living is 
 Separate the fake from who the real reals is 
 Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris 
 Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis 
 Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings 
 I guess it's my addiction to women 
 I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending 
 Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams 
 Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian 
 On the mic, victorious, story is redemption 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone 
 I'm standing here with my soul 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves 
 Teach a man to cook it for survival 
 My dad said it rained on my arrival 
 Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow 
 Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo 
 On the rock and roll with the coldest live show 
 For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em 
 Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low 
 This is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow 
 It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics 
 Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival 
 Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido 
 Crash parties, any live yo 
 Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang 
 From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow 
 Ali MC, I fight for more than the title 
 Your idol 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Produced by No I.D][Intro: Common] 
 In the Spirit of God 
 In the Spirit of the Ancestors 
 In the Spirit of the Black Panthers 
 In the Spirit of Assata Shakur 
 We make this movement towards freedom 
 For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle 
 Yeah. yo, check it- 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing 
 Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent 
 Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle 
 Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh 
 No room to rest, pain consumed each breath 
 Shot twice with her hands up 
 Police questioned but shot before she answered 
 One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his 
 Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her 
 Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on 
 To life. She thought she'd live with no arm 
 That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight 
 They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light 
 Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit 
 Put guns to her head, every word she got hit 
 "Who shot the trooper?" they asked her 
 Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her 
 Her mind raced till things got still 
 Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed 
 She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next 
 Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex 
 They lied and denied visits from her lawyer 
 But she was building as they tried to destroy her 
 If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse 
 I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse 
 I wonder what would happen if that would've been me? 
 All of this just so we could be free 
 So dig it, y'all 
  
 [Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
 I'm thinking of Assata, yes 
 Listen to my love, Assata, yes 
 Your power and pride is beautiful 
 May God bless your soul 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her 
 Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her 
 Though she kind of knew 
 What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue 
 Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning 
 Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in 
 A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell 
 Put in the basement of a prison with all males 
 And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes 
 She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read 
 Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak 
 Away from people so long she forgot how to speak 
 She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound 
 And a wall is a wall and can be broken down 
 Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with 
 One of the brothers she had a child with 
 The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed 
 Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed 
 In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed 
 Out of this situation a girl was conceived 
 Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution 
 And lactated to attack hate 
 Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate 
 Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates 
 They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick 
 And said she robbed places that didn't exist 
 In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites 
 Through dark halls of hate she carried the light 
 I wonder what would happen if that would've been me 
 All of this just so we could be free 
 Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me 
 All of this just so we could be free 
 So dig it, people 
  
 [Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
 I'm thinking of Assata, yes 
 Listen to my love, Assata, yes 
 Your power and pride is beautiful 
 May God bless your soul 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring 
 News that she had had a dream 
 Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean 
 What made them real was the action in between 
 She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens 
 The fact that they always came true was the thing 
 Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't of done 
 Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun 
 It's time for her to see the sun from the other side 
 Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side 
 Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again 
 Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when 
 She untangled the chains and escaped the pain 
 How she broke out of prison I could never explain 
 And even to this day they try to get to her 
 But she's free with political asylum in Cuba 
  
 [Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
 I’m thinking of Assata, yeah 
 Listen to my love, Assata, yeah 
 We’re molded from the same mud, Assata 
 We share the same blood, Assata, yeah 
 Your power and pride, so beautiful 
 May God bless your soul 
 Your power and pride, so beautiful 
 May God bless your soul 
  
 [Outro: Assata Shakur] 
 Freedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is 
  
 The way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to 
 Blossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--[Intro] 
 Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin' 
 Often it's beef this city never does 
 People walk and talk in they sleep 
 Cold sweats and wet dreams 
 On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep 
 Black souls raw and they deep 
 Hypes tryna talk with no teeth 
 Shorties sayin' ball or retreat 
 A lesson we all speak at one point or another 
 What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother 
 Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region 
 Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin' 
 We want decent homes 
 So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on 
 It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on 
 I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong 
 Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn 
 Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs 
 For the real people 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie 
 Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me 
 They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi 
 The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi 
 We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs 
 We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge 
 They say the dope game is sour 
 Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours 
 Come to your crib and devour all that you work for 
 Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for 
 Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays 
 Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality 
 Heard that it's drama at home 
 Can a dude break free and still get honored at home 
 I was told by a chief it's the games nature 
 When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya 
 It's real people 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Black men walking wit white girls on they arms 
 I be mad at em as if I know they moms 
 Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person 
 When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen 
 The weary cursin' the sky 
 Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye 
 I live across from it, some of it I do be in 
 I be showin' niggas lives 
 Like UPN 
 It's real people 
  
 Yeah 
 For you and yours 
 Good music 
 Forever 
 Yeah 
 Rock on 
 We keep on 
 Uh.. Yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The real...[Hook: Lily Allen] 
 It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild 
 I gotta see what's up before it gets me down 
 It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild 
 I gotta see what's up before it gets me down 
 It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild 
 I gotta see what's up before it gets me down 
 Love is not a mystery, it's everything 
  
 [Common] 
 She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show 
 Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go 
 Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo' 
 That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though 
 Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo 
 She spent pesos on those labels 
 Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole 
 She was so obsessed with her body and clothes 
 To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose 
 They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes) 
 Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop 
 Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe 
 She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off 
 All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff 
 Doin all she can for a man and a baby 
 Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Common] 
 He had paper since we was in we was in high school 
 Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school 
 Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels 
 One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes 
 Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report 
 Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports 
 Since golf is in he was on the drivin course 
 To live the rap life is what he was strivin for 
 Spendin cash at the bar to get credit 
 Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it 
 They say Ye is but dude was big headed 
 Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it 
 He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic 
 Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid 
 It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected 
 Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Common] 
 They was one of them couples, people said they were the it 
 Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit 
 Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ 
 Relationships can be dead but look live to us 
 I guess we all been through it where we try too much 
 Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff 
 Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring 
 Where love is not a mystery it's everything 
  
 [Hook]

 [Intro: James Fauntleroy] 
 Thousand lives ago, we were young and we didn't know 
 We were trading our crowns for our souls 
 Made the sacrifice, headed back to the light 
 But be careful don't drown in the gold 
 I know it glows but it's cold 
  
 [Sample] 
 I'm from the other side of town, out of bounds 
 To anybody who don't live around 
 I never learned to share or how to care 
 I never had no teachings about being fair 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones? 
 And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces 
 The concrete matrix, street organizations 
 They gave violations, hood public relations 
 It was the basics to get big faces 
 Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces 
 The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters 
 They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us 
 The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush 
 Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush 
 I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci 
 A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey 
 Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope 
 Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope 
 Rare jewels of a generation 
 Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin' 
 Forties wasted on 'ceased, Dion makin' the beats 
 When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat 
 I could break it down like whatever you need 
 He squinted his face and rolled the weed 
  
 [Interlude] 
 You know they don't see sometimes that in the neighborhood, it's the exact same thing. It's the same thing over and over again. Feel me? 
  
 [Verse 2: G Herbo] 
 Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred? 
 Folly boy, O block, eastside 
 Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride 
 Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'? 
 Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying 
 Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign 
 I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times 
 Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine 
 I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind 
 I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up 
 But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper 
 Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major 
 Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us 
 No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit 
 Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with 
 Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit 
 Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit 
 I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it 
 Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean 
 You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

 Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop 
 By Rakim and Short, I've been inspired 
 My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's 
 Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it 
 I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham 
 Who say the jam is "money, cash, hoes" 
 I went from bashful to asshole to international, lover of self 
 Word to the mother on my last record cover, it's felt 
 Now deal with it 
  
 [Chorus: J Dilla] 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna see you move it 
 So move it 
 So let’s just get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 Can you feel the music? 
 The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 In this never-ending battle to please 
 Niggas, magazine writers, emcees 
 Who request hot shit, I freeze 
 And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold 
 Hold your horses and your carriages 
 This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less 
 You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage 
 Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is 
 I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this 
 And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is 
 Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true 
 Journalist I wreck, shared the same view 
 Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee 
 Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me 
 Some say "You changing, Rashid" 
 Times are, we still close 
 I rhyme far, away away away 
 From what you accustomed to hearing everyday, uh-ah 
 You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dying 
 I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI 
  
 [Chorus: J Dilla] 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna see you move it 
 So move it 
 So let’s just get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 Can you feel the music? 
 The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Women cry, children laugh, men dance 
 I refuse to lose self and try to win fans 
 Over, weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's 
 My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra 
 You couldn't hang if you was a poster 
 Posing like a bitch for exposure 
 It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it 
 You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it 
 Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize 
 Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige 
 Imagining how good the cat must be 
 Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky 
 My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step 
 Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept 
 I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess 
 Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist 
 But man does not live on bread alone 
 What good is a range when it's time to head home? 
  
 [Chorus: J Dilla] 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna see you move it 
 So move it 
 So let’s just get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 Can you feel the music? 
 The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna see you move it 
 So move it 
 So let’s just get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 Can you feel the music? 
 The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go, yeah 
 Say it again 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1 - Common] 
 Sweetheart, you know that you most 
 Important, at least on the West Coast (Huh!) 
 I'm just trippin', it's somethin' about your throat 
 You think different and understand how I float 
 Got cribs on both Coasts 
 But, I'm a Chicago-getter 
 You get down, but you ain't a golddigger 
 You got the soul with the figure to match 
 Your girlfriend said, "Yo, that dude is a catch!" 
 Creative with the gifts, plus he hit it from the back! (Ugh!) 
 And places we ain't supposed to 
 We make the music - baby, you on the vocals 
 International lover, I never stay local 
 Go to places that you never been 
 Beautiful outside, even better when it's in 
 You have arrived, girl - you can come again! 
 C'mon! 
  
 [Hook - D'Angelo] 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 Say it again! 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 OHHHHHHHHHHH! 
  
 [Verse 2 - Common] 
 You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you 
 But, I'm the only one that can get to you 
 Lifting you, my drive is shifting you 
 I opened you free, it's like a gift to you 
 I truly am thickly and thankful 
 And as long I'm in your town, I'mma stay 
 +Faithful+ (Heh!) 
 You know I can't escape you 
 No matter how far, you're still my star 
 You was there when the marks tried to steal my car 
 Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are 
 Sophisticated woman, you understand a man 
 You don't call all the time just to see where I am 
 Put a "G" in your hand, make sure you're livin' alright 
 Makin' love is me and I'mma give it all night 
 Turn over in the morning, make it warmer and better 
 Long as we can be, we can come together 
 C'mon! 
  
 [Hook - D'Angelo] 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 I don't believe you heard me, baby! 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
  
 [Bridge - D'Angelo] 
 Go on, go on then! 
 Go on - go on, girl! 
 Go on, go on - go on, baby! 
 Go on, baby! 
 Go on, girl! 
 Ahhhhhhhhhh! 
  
 [Hook - D'Angelo] 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 You know what I mean, baby! 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go 
 You have come so far 
 You've got so far to go[Produced by No I.D.]

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Ooh that boy he radical 
 Talk that money talk emphatical 
 Who in the game had the baddest hoes 
 Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "I seen what you was on" 
 Home grown with no home phone 
 From the city of wind nigga, win or go home 
 It's the Chi bullshit I'm on 
 Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones 
 Hit them cones, clips and crones 
 I don't play away games, I got hitters at home 
 I'm a dime like six in the morn' 
 Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones 
 Go hard like pyramid stones 
 Stand the test of time cross the burning sands 
 With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme 
 I invest in time 
 Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm 
  
 [Hook: Jhene Aiko] 
 Blak Majik (x16) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical 
 I ride fun facts that's actual 
 Keep it one hunnid that's natural 
 To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow 
 Shout out to black and DC make it capital 
 I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more 
 Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo' 
 Got a whole lot so we can have some mo' 
 So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more 
 Clap clap, home of the original gang bangers, gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers 
 Movie, we are black actors 
 Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik 
 What I do, I own like magic 
 Status of the livest and established 
 Girl with the fattest, I'm givin' you the gladdest 
 Night you ever had this 
 Magic

 [Verse 3: Jhene Aiko] 
 I am the matter that cannot be seen 
 I am the conscious you have in your dream 
 Do not be scared of my dark energy 
 I am not here I exist in between 
 Yeah that's me I'm magical 
 I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro 
 I'm nothing you have had before 
 I'm everything but nothing more 
  
 [Hook: Jhene Aiko][Intro: Canibus] 
 Yeah, yeah, me and my man Common Sense 
 Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin 
 Where you at, yo? 
  
 [Hook: Common and Canibus] 
 I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear 
 Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared 
 And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear 
 Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared 
 That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware 
 "Catch another sucker duck MC out there" 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight 
 I hold mics while you hold spite 
 Like a broken-hearted bitch, don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with 
 Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with 
 Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm 
 Move crowds with kinetic wisdom 
 It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him 
 I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him 
  
 [Verse 2: Canibus] 
 I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines 
 Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time 
 So you niggas need to stop testing me 
 Because you know you can't "F" with me, stepping to me with insuperior weaponry 
 Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations 
 Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation 
 Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels 
 Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls 
 Who wanna battle? I'm bad to the bone marrow 
 The Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows 
 With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard 
 Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage 
 MC's will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed 
 I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch 
 What? 
  
 [Scratching] 
 "Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron" 
 "I ain't scared of no nigga" 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair 
 Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs 
 On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet 
 Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life 
 I write twice and drop singles in record pools 
 Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle 
 Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit 
 The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with 
 Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours 
 I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for 
 Far more advanced than a rapper whose career 
 You could only take a glance 
 Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance 
 I stand in a circumference of humbleness 
 But in the Chi rumble it's 
 Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion 
 Like a picture, I'm the main feature 
 Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers 
 I make my living off of singles like Latifah 
 In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses 
 You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence 
 I'm cold with numb intentions 
  
 [Scratching] 
 "Fucking with Canibus" 
 "Fucking with Canibus" 
 "Fucking with Canibus" 
 "Fucking with Canibus" 
 "Yo, sick with it" 
  
 [Verse 4: Canibus] 
 Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible 
 Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you 
 I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral 
 With three-hundred sixty degree visual 
 When the signal was given, MC's get bitten 
 With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em 
 My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em 
 My face don't belong in The Source, it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain 
 I grab mics and murder shit 
 It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services 
 You heard of this, the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist 
 The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless 
 Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps 
 Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas 
 And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last 
 I'll turn your ass into "The Artist Formerly Known As" 
 You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics 
 Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard 
 So fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars 
 People know who you are 
 Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me 
 Up in The Source chilling on page forty 
 Put this in your CD-ROM 
 WWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com 
 You can find me on the internet talking to chicks 
 That was sweating me off the "Music Makes Me High" remix 
 I be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh 
 See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass 
 Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave 
 Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab 
 You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2 
 Beasts from the East part two, coming to see you 
  
 [Hook: Common and Canibus] 
 It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear 
 Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared 
 Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear 
 You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared 
 That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware 
 "Catch another sucker duck MC out there" 
 Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear 
 Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared 
 And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear 
 Stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared 
 That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

 "Still getting mine, in the 1 9 9 9" 
  
 [Intro: Talib Kweli] 
 Yo, just relax, take it easy, slow down 
 I had this—I had this friend of mine 
 Who, just, you know, he was moving too fast, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill 
 I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta 
 Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you 
 No matter what go on I'm still gettin' mine 
 No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time 
  
 [Common] 
 Check it 
 It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom 
 These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em 
 My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em 
 Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em 
 Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em 
 Molest concepts, stalk rhythms, paid dues, bought wisdom 
 As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call 
 Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall 
 MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that? 
 Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac 
 No mo', still together 
 Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair 
 Holding liquor in despair, gang signs in the air 
 I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
 Hold the mic like a memory 
 Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes 
 Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation 
 Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration 
 Still... 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
  
 [Sadat X] 
 You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough 
 Six days of madness and you might throw me off 
 On this great ball of stress that they call the earth 
 I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through 
 And all the places I went to, always played the low 
 It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you 
 Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you 
 Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick 
 Cause I'm the dead eye, with the red eye, from Chi to L-I 
 I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing 
 And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing 
 A male seed, praise God I name him Moses 
 I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this 
 Now is the glass half-full or half-empty 
 Common, why they tempt me 
 The king of the simply, bore in mic 
 I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like 
 I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday 
 If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way 
 The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother 
 Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress 
 You know I'm still... 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
  
 [Common] 
 Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over 
 Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober 
 Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle 
 In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child 
 Searching for the child in me, this style in me 
 This release is like the piece that's now in me 
 They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony 
 Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style "Nitti" 
 Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty 
 Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt 
 Told her my chamber's like Wilt 
 Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect 
 Less than a hour she was giving me neck, yo I'm still getting mine 
  
 [Scratched Hook][Hook] 
 I remember (REPEATS) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I remember she sit there with her thickness 
 Never played a game but I heard about them sisters 
 A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha" 
 But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us 
 It was hard for me to take down the pictures 
 I was tripping, I even called her sister 
 I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day 
 But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way 
 I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J 
 Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay 
 Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now 
 We fell in love huh just to fall apart now 
 I get your calls and I try to disregard now 
 What was easy for us now is hard now 
 Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together 
 Now we not together, is this our new forever? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call 
 Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls 
 Issues that I had 
 Some say it comes from not seeing my dad 
 Keep moving on 
 Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch 
 Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch 
 Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up 
 Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up 
 On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough 
 I know your young and you gotta live your life ma 
 I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya 
 I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest 
 So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless 
 Who do it better, we used to move together 
 Now we not together, is this our new forever? 
  
 [Hook][Hook: James Fauntleroy] 
 If your eyes are the window to your soul 
 Open eyes bring the cold 
 If your dreams keep you warm in night 
 Baby just keep 'em closed 
 If your eyes are the window 
 I can sneak in at night 
 In your eyes I can see your soul 
 Staring back into mine 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 She was a beautiful rose 
 From the concrete and heat she grows 
 In the dark room her life was exposed 
 Her picture of men, we walk on all fours 
 Heart opened and heart closed 
 Every now and then she sparkles 
 You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose 
 I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose 
 Even when the door close, there grows a new one 
 I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one 
 Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him 
 Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run 
 Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian 
 I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision 
 But not to be married with kids she was wishing 
 Shhh, 'til your soul just listen 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 She said daddy take me ice-skating 
 Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her 
 Gotta be there to support her 
 Can't really wait for a court order 
 She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant 
 A lot of love inside, got to help guide it 
 Daddy will protect it, God will provide it 
 We all will be there so your soul ain't divided 
 Man, how quick she grows 
 Looking like her momma but she got my toes 
 I suppose it's the age that she really really need me 
 A lot of girls without, they become needy 
 "Como on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat 
 Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?" 
 As she begins the race of life and love I told her 
 "I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya" 
  
 [Hook][Produced by Kanye West] 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Victory won, in a world of Henessey and guns 
 Too young for the marches but I remember these drums 
 The stark reality of wars and battles 
 We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy 
 I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee 
 And recognize the importance of family 
 Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe 
 Those that doubt Com' will soon believe 
 Can't judge the weave, my lady had one 
 I'm more like a fool for soul and passion 
 The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is 
 I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors 
 No religion or race could ever describe us 
 My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it 
 Forever begins just because I thought about it 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Ashes and snowfalls 
 I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come 
 Forever gon' come 
 It's a cold world and I can never go numb 
 Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run 
 Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come 
 For now I write the world letters to better the young 
 On tree by jury, together we hung 
 Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain 
 'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing 
 It trickles down, at each other we aim pain 
 I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars 
 Through the ride I learned to earn hard 
 Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war 
 No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor 
 It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone 
 That's when I knew we'd live forever through song 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
 Living once again 
 We live 
 Then you're gone 
  
 [Outro: Pops] 
 Origin is forever 
 Well, well well 
 Here we are back in the studio again 
 Look at that 
 Hey I don' need no cue cards 
 They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards 
 What that say? 
 Oh they say, just talk, don't sing 
 Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever 
 30 years old red eyes, beholding red eyes 
 I see my world's tears 
 Yeah, origin is forever 
 Every peak will have 2 valleys 
 Hopeful eyes in the comfort 
 Of true protection and admiration of a child 
 That's forever 
 Forever is to strive 
 A place of endearment 
 Forever is what I leave 
 My I-self contribution 
 Damn, what I'm gon' leave? 
 Ok... 
 I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand 
 To universal scales of humanity, all humanity 
 Forever is finding a solution to a solution 
 Tsunamis, hurricanes 
 Following the trails of the African slave ships 
 War, war, and more war 
 Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes 
 Another somebody done me wrong, son 
 Virginia Tech, is not an, "Oh, what the heck?" 
 We're still, did you place your one grain 
 Of spiritual sand forever? 
 Confusion need a solution 
 Blend and stir, stir and blend 
 The pot of humanity; sift the ingredients 
 Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement 
 We gonna work with the four A's here 
 Forever Pops 
 Common good is forever... 
 God's memory is forever...Yo, niggas don't want none of this 
 Niggas know they can't fuck with this 
 Turn this shit up just a little more 
  
 [Verse] 
 I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat 
 Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope 
 Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara 
 Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror 
 Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated 
 Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it 
 Players is getting traded 
 I drop a gem on, them who's style is jaded 
 My juice is grated 
 Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related 
 On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision 
 Crews is getting split like decisions 
 Com'a let it ride and collision 
 Vision like Coleco or intele, I battle stars in stellar 
 Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring 
 Now, it's teething 
 My reason to rhyme applies to season and time 
 Seizing the mind, body and regions divine 
 In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine 
 Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube 
 Came in this rap life nude 
 Now I'm fully clothed with flows 
 You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes 
 Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos 
 With classic material, imperial and rugged like 
 Got mag, but my slugs a mic 
 You fake like a smile, like a hug I'm tight 
 Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night 
 Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right 
 Downtown interracial lovers hold hands 
 I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style 
 Hold a Stone Isle profile 
 Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild 
 Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming 
 Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do 
 Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you 
 Some wack niggas be cool, with them I stay cordial 
 Flow at room temperature, cats is presumed miniature 
 Like golf, soft like Tiger Woods 
 At real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric 
 Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it 
 I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist 
 Rhyme wise, you a rest haven 
 You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven 
 You need to do more deleting and less saving 
 A praise in hell, raising heaven 
 As the bill on my pager leavens 
 What you should have known from day one 
 You will on day seven 
  
 Hungry hip hop junkie in the city[Hook: Bilal] 
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind 
 Black maybe... 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe 
 I was delivered in this world as a crack baby 
 Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy 
 Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady 
 Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare 
 And I'm the kingest kong 
 They say we dreaming wrong 
 Them same strips that them older cats lingered on 
 Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born 
 We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable 
 It's hard to turn on the hood that made you 
 To leave we afraid to 
 The same streets that raised you can age you 
 With other black birds that's caged too 
 A rage up in Harlem and the southside 
 Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open 
 Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight 
 The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind 
 Black maybe... 
  
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind 
 Black maybe... 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham 
 Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him 
 The stones had his back and they'd pat him 
 He was living a life they couldn't fathom 
 Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships 
 Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick 
 For the pros the one from the hood that was chose 
 The black rose that grew in the jungle 
 But humble stud still had rumble in his blood 
 Women all around giving him trouble love 
 You know the love when you up they down 
 Cause you wrap a ball they round 
 Your win is their crown 
 Dudes in the circle he known for years 
 Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers 
 When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react 
 Them same studs shot him in the back 
 Now that's black...maybe 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind 
 Black maybe... 
  
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind 
 Black maybe... 
  
 [Interlude: Common] 
 When we talk about black maybe 
 We talk about situations 
 Of people of color and because you are that color 
 You endure obstacles and opposition 
 And not all the time from... from other nationalities 
 Sometimes it come from your own kind 
 Or maybe even your own mind 
 You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong 
 You get sighted for not being strong 
 The struggle of just being you 
 The struggle of just being us... black maybe 
  
 Black maybe... 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Can't come around 
 They gon' wanna bring you down 
 No one knows just what's inside 
 Doing dope and doing time 
 Why they messing with your mind

 Good Morning Viet-Com, I'm back 
 Huh, it's me again 
 Is it me you're looking for? (Yup) 
 For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique 
 I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle 
 Psss, I'm only buggin 
 While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose 
 And picked a rhyme, any rhyme I don't have any time 
 To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip 
 To an easy travel agent now we fly for free 
 I can be fly for free 
 You want some fire tree, then buy from me 
 I got the flame like U-I-C but I be from U-A-C 
 Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see 
 In your life if you get one 
 Rappers are like jobs to me (Why?) because they get done 
 Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw 
 That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks 
 This is not da bomb so save all your threats 
 I'm good to go and also I'm Rets 
 Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks 
 Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros 
 Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded 
 To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers 
 Players with plats, studs with stocking caps 
 I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse 
 Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps 
 I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high 
 Hi C, I'm free at last 
 I'm a free man, free as World B 
 And like an early bird, I'm special 
 You ain't that special, as Ed and Vesta 
 So to myself I say congratulations 
 I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience 
 'Cause this is me

 Off the GP niggas see me on the TV 
 Talkin' Take It EZ, and they was like "He ain't hardcore!" 
 But hardcore is far more than bats and gats 
 It stems back to the roots of being true 
 It's gonna get me Me, you just get you You 
 What I look like, talkin' about some shit I ain't do? 
 I ain't shoot nobody, I ain't shank nobody, I ain't kill nobody 
 It wasn't us, it was them 
 The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to sho-gun 
 It takes one to know one, and no one can 
 Tell me how to be, 'cause I'mma be me, aight?

 Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling! 
 When I'm chillin' at the flat, lookin' at the wall 
 Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit 
 On the mic I be talkin' shit 
 But some say my talk don't make no Sense 
 I'm tryin' to make dollars 
 My momma told me to go to school and be a scholar 
 But school ain't for me 
 So don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where 
 Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair 
 But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client 
 I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark 
 A Raider that never Lost the Ark, on the shot 
 But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath 
 My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef 
 But he went down South, and fell in love, call me love 
 'Cause love is gonna getcha — I'mma getcha! 
 I'm like B.J., my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya 
 Styles from East to West, all across the country 
 I'm like that big fat woman 'cause cats wanna bump me 
 I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster 
 But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love 
 I love my music, I love my momma 
 I love myself, I love you, and you love me 
 And this is, I'm out 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Yo, I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmomma 
 Lil Chandra, and John, yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella 
 Rahsaan's moms, Ron's moms, Dawn's moms, Corey's moms 
 Who are you? These people be themselves y'all, peace and love

 Common (over scratch of "can't nobody out here change me")[MIGO (Channing Tatum)] 
 Um, where are you takin' me? 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER (Common)] 
 Aha, so many questions. I think it's about time I give you some answers 
  
 [MIGO] 
 Wow. What is this? 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 You see, Migo 
 There was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds 
 We were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd 
 Of Smallfoot, that's right, we used to live down there 
 But there were actions we could not forgive down there 
 And though they used a different nomenclature 
 Man, or human, they showed us human nature 
 A dangerous species that we approached with wonder 
 They attacked with their spears and their smokin' sticks of thunder 
 They called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable 
 They chased us, pursued us, their persistence indomitable 
 We had no choice but to run and hide 
 Otherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide 
 So we climbed this mountain just to stay alive 
 You see, we knew that up here, Smallfoot cannot survive 
 So it was here the first law was written in stone 
 It was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known 
 Our world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds 
 That's how it would be 
 And then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey 
 For the sake of us all, it was the only way 
 To protect us from all of the human ravages 
 Heaped upon us by those human savages 
  
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 (Now you know, now you know) And new rules apply 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 So it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie) 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 (Now you know, now you know) And you can't deny 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 That it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie) 
  
 [MIGO] 
 But my Smallfoot, he's not like that 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 They're all like that. Tell me, when you found him. Did he greet you with open arms? 
 They don't care about us. They don't care about anything but themselves. Which is why we must do the same if we care about our future 
  
 [MIGO] 
 Wait, we're below the clouds 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 Or so it would seem, but look closer 
  
 [MIGO] 
 Those aren't clouds, it's steam 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 The stones are working 
  
 [MIGO] 
 The stones? 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 Every job and every task is pointless as it seems 
 All of it ensures that this important machine 
 Keeps turning and turning and spinnin' around 
 So those below don't look up and those above don't look down 
 And they'll look 'cause even if they hear of these atrocities 
 The only thing stronger than fear is curiosity 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
  
 [MIGO] 
 Wait so, so none of those stones are true, they're all lies? 
 (Now you know, now you know, let it lie) 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 Good lies to protect our world 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
  
 [MIGO] 
 But they need to know the truth 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 Oh, do they? 
 You feel emboldened by your noble quest to find the truth 
 I chalk it up to the naive innocence of youth 
 So let me share a secret that you'll learn as you grow older 
 What's true or not true is in the eye of the beholder 
 So do you wanna prevent our own annihilation? (Yes!) 
 Then our only goal should be to control the flow of information 
 Unless you wanna see the Smallfoot conquer and pillage (No!) 
 Then protect the lie and you protect the village 
 Lives are at stake, Migo. Your friends, your father, Meechee 
 She's curious and you know what they say: curiosity killed the yak 
  
 [MIGO] 
 So what do you want me to do? 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 Tell everyone you were lying about the Smallfoot 
  
 [MIGO] 
 But they've already seen it, they--they're not gonna believe me 
  
 [THE STONEKEEPER] 
 You'll be surprised at what they'll believe 
 You think knowledge is power, Migo? 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 (Now you know, now you know) 
 Question is 
 (Now you know, now you know, now you know) 
 What are you gonna do with that power? 
 (Hmm)[Scratches: DJ Premier]

 [Verse 1] 
 Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame 
 Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain 
 Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game 
 My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain 
 My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game 
 You was hot but can't stay in the flame 
 Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black 
 Can tell the real by how the real interact 
 In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track 
 Kickback records get kicked to the back 
 I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his 
 Child in a good school and know what her gift is 
 It's global warming, the world is shifting 
 Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids 
 Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance 
 Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

 I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses 
 Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards 
 They try to box me in like Cassius Clay 
 Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted 
 Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes 
 Scratches over third eyelashes 
 Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers 
 Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes 
 In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers 
 From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress 
 I seen 'em dashing smash hits 
 I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics 
 The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets 
 Making it hard for real hustlas 
 Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend 
 Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

 [Verse 3] 
 I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever 
 From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure 
 Selling weed out of cleaners 
 From rocks to barber shops and beemers 
 Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena 
 The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled 
 Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh 
 GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds 
 Five year olds walking by them self in the street 
 The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat 
 Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace 
 Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east 
 The game ain't tasting as sweet 
 Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats 
 My radio station is deep, so eff 'em 
 Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

 "Our music..."[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Should it be, can it be simple? 
 Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental 
 Things that we been through define who we are now 
 Since "Can I Borrow a Dollar?" 
 Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town 
 We was the first to do it 
 Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music 
 The city on our back, we was the opening act 
 Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back 
 But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks 
 I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map 
 By then, No I was my main guy 
 He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr 
 We had came far together, with a long way to go 
 Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles 
 Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game 
 Felt I had to leave home to be a household name 
 Show money low, needin' to stack fast 
 City did have my back, now it's a backlash 
 Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad? 
 I just became a dad, rap was all I had 
 So I moved to New York, to make it pop 
 Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot 
 But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it 
 And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it 
 Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song 
 It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone 
 Wishin' I could get that time back 
 Oh I can, yo man, rewind that 
 Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone 
 For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home 
 Rewind that and we could do it again 
 No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This one's for my man J Dilla 
 As I say these words, my eyes fill up 
 Cuz wasn't non' realer than James  Dewitt Yancey 
 So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family 
 In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee 
 I still remember the first beat he played me 
 He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy 
 Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free 
 I got the the D, "peace yo, big love" 
 Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club 
 Then we made "The Light" and times got brighter 
 I said "turn it up" Jay'll take it higher 
 One day, I noticed he was tired quick 
 That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick 
 Things got worse before they got better 
 I said, "Come to L.A. for peace and good weather" 
 We got an apartment just so we could spark it 
 MP in the front room, records in the closet 
 The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there 
 I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair 
 It was hard for me to come home every day 
 And see my homie Jay's life fade away 
 I stayed away some times, in other words I ran 
 Til one day J brought me this TV stand 
 It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it 
 It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it 
 The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth 
 I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth 
 Wishing we could have that time back 
 Oh we can, yo man, rewind that 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You never gone, you live forever through song 
 I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on 
 I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me 
 Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me 
  
 [Outro] 
 (Common) 
 That's the infinite team right there, me and Jay Dee, I'mma work with him whenever I can, cause he's just like, constantly progressing and growing. He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that 
  
 Like, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, "Man, I'm blessed." I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say "I was blessed, I know I was blessed." But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music 
  
 (J Dilla) 
 Common, ok for me, ok it's definitely not a Common album 
 But, it's Common[Verse 1: Common] 
 A nigga told me only rhyme for 19-year-olds 
 Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes 
 Here it goes, lyrical miracles 
 These are pyramids from the imperial 
 In theory, though, low end scenario 
 And sound boy burial drove me to classic material 
 Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes 
 For ethereal heights, I write like Richard 
 Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable 
 Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go 
 Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door 
 I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though 
 This is a ritual for those depicted as low 
 Now I passed life like I've been here before 
 The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold 
 Us Back, coldest raps 
 For me the globe is like a culdesac 
 Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay 
 I'm from the weather where they spray 
 There's gotta be a better way, people dying every day 
 Wonder what would heaven say 
 The devils need to get away 
 From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades 
 I kneel where the rebels prayed 
 Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades 
 Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde 
 The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born 
 It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed

 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot

 I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted 
 Smoke a little, keep a high standard 
 The Roots are my niggas so got a fly band with 
 Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with 
 Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich 
 A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps 
 My bio is feedback from what we need rap 
 On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back 
 And come with that new black spiritual 
 Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical 
 Can't lack lyrical, we need black generals 
 Holy war, tap into you like Savion 
 But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy 
 Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame 
 I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions 
 Envision a vision of what we wishing 
 I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind 
 Spit the wisdom of the one devine 
 Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line 
 Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes 
 Styled by Michaela in the suite with Caroline 
 Getting dressed up under pressure, Alabama Shakes on 
 Incense rising from the dresser 
 Child of a fresher God 
 Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard 
 Assata Shakur, I gotta do more 
 The light-skinned spook who got in the door 
 I got in here for the same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for 
 I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man 
 And where we land the pyramids stand

 I be the one they call Petey 
 I'm Poe as Edgar Allan 
 But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin' 
  
 [Ynot] 
 Egad it is I, master Ynot, never the less 
 Fresh like air, well dressed, yes the LS is here 
 I appear on piers with my peers 
 The Imperial like margarine, I'm butter 
 Yes, fly like my Lear, I jet 
  
 [Common] 
 Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time 
 It's time for some percolator 
 I circulate around the block black 
 So give me a six-pack and a half of Harold's Chicken 
 A good combination 
 When I get bubbly, I do it in moderation 
 One brew, one brew, I said one brew at a time 
  
 [Ynot] 
 Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady 
 May Sadie say Sade and may Ms. Goldberg say 
 "Yo Whoopie, there it is" 
 Call me E cause I equal MC squared 
 In the Biz, marks know I got the key, to get the girl's noses 
 Open like the vapors, more pub than the papers 
 More papers than the press, oh yes, I gets paid 
  
 [Common] 
 Yes, check it 
 I didn't grow grow up up po' po' 
 But once you get grown, and out on your own 
 Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have 
 Before you get your check then you already spend half 
 See I make money, money doesn't make me 
 I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8 
  
 [Ynot] 
 Enough 
 I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls 
 To have them comin' in (ohhh yes) 8 seconds 
 I told Victoria her secret you suck, like Sucrets 
 I Ultrawhite my secretary, I went to Tibet 
 To bet on my horse you bet your life 
 Mine was better and now your deader 
 Than a (door knob) eah wrong

 I'm fancy, man, I tickles like the French 
 Not Johnny but like Bench I press on like Lee 
 I stan' like Lee, while you stagger like Lee 
 Most likely I'll dagger that bull-ish I pull ish like a magnet 
 Or Dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income 
 Yo, bums I rush like adrenaline 
 I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed 
 Like a sleigh dog, I slay dogs who are under me 
 I'm over men; call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies 
 That's pretty, leave your city green from all the money I spent 
 I stay fresh like a mint from mint 
 I meant my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice 
 Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman 
 Friendly like neighbors, not Jim 
 But like Gomer I got piles of loot 
 Attention salute, I kill loot but won't dilute 
 Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute 
 Man, I'm too rich for that, bitch! 
  
 (Ynot got the money) 
  
 [Hook] 
 (Common) So what's your name? 
 (Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht 
 I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet 
 And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy 
 (Common) Cause without the money 
 "Ain't a damn thing funny" (5x) 
  
 [Common] 
 Ynot, let me tell ya a story 
 Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man 
 The black man of course he was po' (yeah) 
 The white man, he was rich (uh-huh) 
 And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (aight c'mon) 
 Okay the black man lived on Beat Street 
 The white man lived on Wall Street 
 And at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet 
 Not really on the good foot 
 Cause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (damn!) 
 And in his shoes there were holes 
 But the white man didn't care, shit; 
 He didn't have to wear it (uh-uh) 
 The scratch that he had, he got from his parents 
 With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway 
 Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change 
 But at him, the white man would stare strange 
 So the black man got fed up 
 Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him 
 And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him 
 The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon 
 And now the black man own the store 
 And the name of it is Leon's 
 (...What's that?) 
 Barbecue, that is! (Oh...) 
 Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken 
  
 [Hook] 
 (Common) So what's your name? 
 (Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht 
 I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet 
 And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy 
 (Common) Cause without the money 
 "Ain't a damn thing funny" 
 (Ynot) Now what's your name? 
 (Common) Well I'm the Com, the broke Com Sense 
 And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense 
 And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy 
 (Ynot) Cause without no money 
 "Ain't a damn thing funny" 
  
 [Outro - Ynot] 
 Two thousand and thirteen shot 
 Common Sense and Ynot 
 UAC and Darian combined 
 We rock while you rot, no stress[Hook: PJ] 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I'm on what? What you on to? 
 I'm the sun god, let me warm you 
 Out of my sides the Lord formed you 
 Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal 
 Our fragrance is patience 
 We could major in communication 
 Relatin' like we cousins, though we kissin' though 
 Love can be sick or medicinal 
 A doctor of it, you gots to love it 
 God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin' 
 In your ear with somethin' that ain't clear 
 On your inside it appear, so somehow you hear 
 I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside 
 They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside 
 Of everything you are 
 Cause everything you are is my lovestar 
  
 [Hook: PJ] 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I ain't the type to be all up on your social 
 I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to 
 A choosy lover, I chose you 
 God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you 
 You already in shape, that's more love to make 
 Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape 
 When we need a break 
 We take it 
 When two souls connect you can't fake it 
 TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite 
 Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it 
 This ain't about labels, this about fit 
 Since God designed, we can start our own line 
 Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined 
 We walk the runway like blaow 
 Bein' in love is never out of style 
  
 [Hook: PJ] 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
  
 [Verse 3: Marsha Ambrosius] 
 Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here 
 Cause you make it all worth it 
 We do this on purpose 
 The love we make is certain 
 I'm so caught in your aura, get lost in your force 
 I want to be your everything forever, forever 
  
 [Hook: PJ] 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Forever, I wanna be forever 
 Forever, star 
 Lovestar, lovestar[Intro] 
 You Troy, I'mma come on the rhythm 
 With a little communism 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Chick-a chick-a I'm 
 Chick-a chick-a on 
 Chick-a chick-a my 
 My, own shit 
 Like an entrepreneur, that stepped in manure 
 Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill 
 And Jack Jill's big bootay 
 We did the booty up, I told the Bitch she Betta Have My Money 
 Or step to the AMG 
 You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be 
 That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds 
 But since then, Common calm down! 
 I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated 
 Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated 
 Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain 
 On my brain no complain and so will my community 
 And I prefer compliments 
 So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees 
 It's the nineties, and music got known for the grease 
 I got a sense of direction and a compass 
 Com passed MC's with no compassion, though I heard the screams of 
 But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort? 
 Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill 
 But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals 
 Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company 
 And Com is on a mission not to work for commission 
 It's a common market and it's so much competition 
 But to me, competition is none 
 To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot 
 My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it 
 Instead of competing with Pete 
 Com compromised, Com made a promise 
 Not to commercialize, but compound the soul 
 With other elements, compelling sense into Communism[Hook: Kanye West] 
 'ey baby, am I crazy? 
 Or was you givin me the eye? 
 You said maybe? (Yea) Well, you crazy 
 Because I know I'm too fly 
 Already know I'm too fly 
 Already know I'm too fly (You hype!) 
 Already know I'm too fly 
 Yeah, I know what you like 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Right now I'm off the wine, wine, we can take our time, time 
 So much I want to punch spill the bump when we grind 
 My uh is in ya body, my uh is in ya mind 
 Check my dictionary, that ass is so divine 
 It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs 
 I knock and I knock, uhh, can I come inside? 
 I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside? 
 I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs 
 It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain 
 What make it feel so good, that type of stuff you can't explain 
 I do, what I do, to do, to make it rain 
 You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad ya came 
 'Cause you the type of dame to be game and yo 
 Mic check like the way I begin my show 
 Girl I come from chica' so in I 'go 
 Turn around, it's about to be a TKO 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Some call me Com (Com), some call me the Red (Red) 
 You can call me daddy, I'mma put ya to bed 
 An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed 
 This sexual eruption gotcha hittin ya head 
 On the board and, knock, you screamin, "Oh Lord" 
 We exchange like students cause I study a broad 
 And listen to ya body and, low key party and 
 I keep pushin and pushin, you pump the vol-i-ume up 
 We the type to make lovin we up 
 We take a ride down south cause you need to re-up 
 Girl you call me Big Bank like I was savin it up 
 I'm the doctor, I can hold it 'til patience is up 
 Ah, ah, ah-ah - I make, I make I make it hot baby 
 Ah, ah-ah - I know, I know, I know ya spot baby 
 When we do it like we don't want it to end 
 It's three PM we gon' do it again 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge: Pharrell] 
 C'mon girl, let's go 
 To distant lands unknown 
 We can fly on air 
 If love is every where for you and me 
  
 [Hook] + [Bridge][Verse 1] 
 I express like an interstate 
 Hyper when I ventilate 
 My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state 
 Just to reiterate 
 That I innovate 
 Bonin' broads when they men-estruate 
 I spend a great time with the rhyme 
 More than I did any female 
 I derailed your train of thought 
 Because your brain was caught 
 On some other man's thinking 
 Now your third eye is blinking 
 My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking 
 I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure 
 If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw 
 This track was a broad 
 I'd be bonin the shit out of it 
 Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her 
 Probably some scratch clothes and some J's 
 I got six million ways to rhyme 
 Choose one 
 I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team 
 I got goals, and I can like a pop machine 
 I come clean 
 Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab 
 Stir my style crazy 
 Cause that's right, we bad, we bad 
 Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga 
 Cause I kick ass 
 And when I wreck it other rappers be like "whiplash!" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's like I come to the party in a b-boy stance 
 I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
 I come to the party in a b-boy stance 
 I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
 Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper 
 I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer 
 If Barry White was in the mob 
 I still would be deeper 
 Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin 
 MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like "What's up?" 
 I said, "You know you done fucked up 
 Now I'm sayin, "You know you done fucked up" 
 Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA 
 Cause I'm on fire 
 If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire 
 It's funny how time flies 
 Well I'm as fly as time 
 I don't believe in role models 
 But if I do, then I'm mine 
 I make brothers say "True" 
 They see you and be like "Fiction" 
 I want 'spect and dead presidents 
 Like Richard Nixon 
 I'm a coach not a player 
 Not a gay mc, I'm straighter 
 My style is similiar to AIDS 
 You can f with it now 
 But catch you later 
 You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro 
 I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo' 
 Just chillin' 
 Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace 
 I'm out to Dirty Burgers I'mma give my change to Reese[Verse 1: Common] 
 Flowers bloom, the early part of June 
 Noon is the time 
 Stay in tune, there's a lot going through my mind 
 Got up this morning, smelling like fumes of wine 
 My man had his bachelor's, an exclusive time 
 We're getting ready now, he 'bout to walk the aisle 
 A pimp's funeral, but we're gon' walk in style 
 I'm feeling proud, yet I'm feeling funny 
 And it ain't cause his niggas still owe me money 
 Cause it's my buddy here 
 We've been through lots of years 
 Lot of beers, lots of fights, lots of nights 
 Dreams about our career 
 Now we're here in these tuxes 
 I remember back when we was hustlers 
 Move work, doing dirt, girls say we ho'ed around 
 Still doing it, we're just older now 
 Fixing his bow-tie, his collar, I fold it down 
 I'm the best man, I'm supposed to hold it down 
 We're sober now, but I'mma be lit tonight 
 One of these bridesmaids, I might have to hit tonight 
 He said "The Light" is his first song, I'm honored 
 It's already been drama, she don't like his momma 
 Maybe that's karma, huh, he's a good cat 
 A good cat ain't supposed to be with a hoodrat 
 I knew her back, back, when we went to FAMU 
 And like a black college, a lot of niggas ran through 
 Scandalous, the type you can't trust 
 Whatever you get her is just never enough 
 Plus, about her, I know too much stuff 
 Of being straight bogus, she's on the cusp 
 I'mma hush, cause today is his big day 
 These colors we're wearing, yeah they're a bit gay 
 But anyway, I told him when we first started 
 Now we must toast for the sincerely departed 
 Am I being jealous-hearted, I'm debating 
 Maybe cause my guy's in love, I'm just hating 
 We're waiting on Reverend Clayton and for her to get ready 
 The church bells is ringing and the ring is real heavy 
 Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy 
  
 [Interlude] 
 You remember that, man 
 You remember that, yo 
 Yo, I ain't even, I ain't even gonna lie 
 Yeah, I can't really make it in step with this girl 
 Nah man, it's what a man's gotta do 
 It's a good thing for you, man 
 Yeah, we gon', yeah 
 It's gonna be right 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 It's a Black wedding, you know it started late 
 Family members arguing on who gon' get a plate 
 His relatives saying they just can't relate 
 To her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake 
 I feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive 
 It's hard when I think of ball players she then courted 
 But I ain't gonna agitate, I congratulate 
 It's like a weave, half is real, half is fake 
 They knew the caterer, so they got it half the rate 
 Her father, Mr. Cook, looking like he half baked 
 Pimped out in red velvet, his suit match the cape 
 Looking at his watch, damn, how much these pastors make? 
 But wait, oh shit, there go his ex-girl Shawna 
 Man, I hope it don't be no drama 
 That lady in the big hat, that's his grandmama 
 For him taking a step, I at least gotta honor 
 Cause maybe she changed, and I'm just tripping 
 We're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping 
 I read between the lines, see, that's the sign 
 Kind of mixed about when it will be my time 
 To settle down 
 Her little niece Sherice throwing petals down 
 Looking at marriage 
 Narrow is the aisle, as they were saying their vows 
 A ghetto phone went off with the song all loud 
 Wiping my brow, cause now I'm nervous 
 She looking beautiful in her dress, I'm looking at her curves 
 It's natural to look, I try to look off 
 He said, speak or hold your peace, I gave a good cough 
 "Are you serious?" The reverend smelling filthy 
 But on the real, I'm the one feeling guilty 
 Cause if this was court and I had to tell the truth 
 I should have told my man before he said I do 
  
 [Outro - Cocaine 80s] 
 I gotta tell you what's good, think it's all bad 
 I congratulate you like it's all that 
 Got my dress, I'll stand up for your celebration 
 Even though it's love imitation 
 Imitation, imitation 
 Imitation 
  
 Congratulations, my man 
 For real, good luck with that 
 Hey, you can't appreciate the sunshine 
 If it never rains 
 And it's gonna rain[Pops] 
 Yeah, yeah, bring it on 
 Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah 
 Just sitting around kicking it a little bit 
 I thought we would record something tonight 
 And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people 
 I live the spirit of 
 Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey 
 Thank you so much 
  
 The Believer 
 If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning 
 Everybody's beginning 
 Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present 
 When God stepped to the mic 
 I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden 
 The separation of the tribes 
 Our long marches across the desert 
 Being Yacub's kids 
 For instincts born in caves of ice 
 All, each and every one, the souls of one God 
 Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn 
 The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe 
 With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own 
 No search, no fear no mysteries 
 We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams 
 For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances 
 Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true 
 Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life 
 Life becomes belief, belief becomes live! 
 Live the life you believe 
 The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream 
 For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God 
 I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings 
 I believe in Dr. Sebi, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n each other 
 I believe in the truth, truth 
 See you next lifetime"Friends, Romans, Countrymen ... lend me a dollar! Ahh-ha!" 
 "How much? A dollar." 
 "One dollar..." 
 "I got your money. I got your poor, measly..." 
 "One dollar..." 
 "Can I borrow a dollar?" 
 "Nigga you ain't shit. You wasn't shit when you was here! I seen you do that shit all that's the same shit you was doin' 'round the poolroom nigga. It ain't nothin'. Let me have a dollar." 
 "Can I have a dolla? One dolla." 
 "One dollar..." 
 "How much? A dollar." 
 "One dollar..." 
 "One beer? Man you gotta give me a dollar for a beer."

 With some peas and a hole in the bucket (cool, cool) 
 Dear Liza, Minelli, I jam like jelly and I got 
 Helly what, helly what, helly rhymes 
 I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks 
 Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks 
 Now what do niggas do when they got not food 
 Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap 
 So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin 
 Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin 
 Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose 
 I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use 
 Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account 
 Not on a blind date, could I see me taken out 
 By some glutteus, glutteus, maximus, maximus 
 I'm spas-ta-gis-a-mister-gis a mister-gis-ta-spas-ta-gis 
 Spectacular, the papes I Count like Dracula 
 You can't cut the rug, because you suck, MC Vacumn Up 
 Rappers I stiff arm like Walter Payton

 Some steps with concepts, but umm, WHO cares

 A-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, here I come, here I come (yeah!) 
 I'm comin around the mountain high as lower than a valley 
 I'm the cat, from the alley, from the back, I'mma rally 
 And tally up points, rollin joints, risin to the tops 
 Somewhat of a playwright, cause like a stage I got props 
 My crew's a strange brew, a drink a day'll keep the stink away 
 We been through AA, but hey, what can I say? 
 Say say say, what you want, but you'll pay the con-se-quences 
 Cause Mister Common Sense is (yeah)

 Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C 
 Heyyyyyy, but anyway

 Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it 
 Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow 
 Somebody done stole my beeper but I'mma steal the show 
 I'm throwin a Heidi Ho into a bro and tellin her 
 Go for what you know bruh, the people before me go under 
 Yo we gotta gotta get we gotta get we gotta get 
 Gotta get, gotta gotta gotta get get over 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, I'm still the same old same old 
 Ringin around the collar, borrowin a dollar, check my balls 
 Dirty drawers, see the kitty suckin titties 
 Video watchin lush from the city 
 I'm the extra-terrestrial, rappers phone home cause they have to 
 Them marks be callin', Ork, come in Ork, Nanu Nanu 
 The perfect stranger, comin in to a, fuck a new land 
 Cause Jeffrey where I was born, and see I'm only human 
 Doin anything to make a buck, what the fuck I gotta 
 Do what I gotta go (*echoes*)[Hook] 
 Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "Don't break my heart") 
 Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "Don't break my heart") 
 Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you 
 With lots of love to give 
 (Love to give...you, you) 
 Love to give 
 Love to give 
  
 [Verse One] 
 It was a dream day, met her on spring break 
 Look like the type that be like "No hable inglés" 
 She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e? 
 And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay 
 I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e 
 She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky 
 She said "You know I dont be datin' rappers" 
 I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets 
 And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it 
 With her roommate who was a video vixen 
 Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted 
 Said "I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress" 
 You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious 
 Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes 
 She said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Time revolve, we fell in love as crazy as Nas 
 And them broads was textin cuz I stop calling them 
 I met the parents, watch the game with her father and 
 Questions of marriage and I start dodging them 
 What happen to me happens to lots of men 
 Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen 
 As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon 
 She said "there you go, breakin my heart again!" 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Interlude] 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1: Common] 
 There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me 
 When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me 
 Good food and the mood and the hood is free 
 Peace and free is the frequency 
 This is the day women took over 
 No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over 
 Imagine, war is now over 
 Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers 
 On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa 
 The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier 
 Hoods feel safer, families feel closer 
 We all drunk in love with no need to be sober 
 Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice 
 You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest 
 Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless 
 We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again 
 Things are merry and there's more marryin' 
 Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian 
 For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows 
 Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes 
 It's more love songs on the radio 
 Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow 
 Egos aside, for each other we rise 
 Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive 
  
 [Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 Oh, when women take over the world 
 Oh, every man, woman, boy and girl 
 Oh, maybe one day, we will see 
 Peace and unity the way it's meant to be 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The day women took over, let it continue 
 Now women get paid as much as men do 
 Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window 
 Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you 
 Body is a temple, men don't prey 
 Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay 
 Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer 
 Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer 
 Harriet, Sojourner's truth is marchin' on 
 Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm 
 Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins 
 Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin' 
 No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters 
 After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber 
 The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters 
 And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted 
 In court, kids can't be tried as adults 
 And women, they called bitches because they a boss 
 In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized 
 Goddess and queens is what we use to describe 
 Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution 
 Beyoncé made the music for the revolution 
 Imagine it, a world more compassionate 
 The balance of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if 
  
 [Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 Oh, what if women took over the world 
 Oh, every woman, boy and girl 
 Oh, maybe one day, we will see 
 Peace and unity the way it's meant to be[Intro: Pharrell] 
 Aiyyo, all they wanna do is dance 
 That's all they wanna do 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 This is that automatic 
 I stay fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic 
 P goes spastic, C galactic 
 Southside boy, we Cadillac it 
 Charismatic, Asiatic 
 I hustle for mathematics 
 Cameras, action, changed the status 
 Actor tappin' yo' favorite actress 
 Gucci rockin', coochies poppin' 
 Movie watchin', booties droppin' 
 Body movin', showin', provin' 
 Stylin' and being fly (c'mon) 
 I touch the masses like a Catholic 
 Expensive rap shit, my future's backlit 
 Interact with the cat who macks and stacks 
 My vernac' attracts y'all react; so let's go, uhh 
  
 [Hook: Pharrell] 
 This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line 
 That universal mind control, now move yo' behind 
 Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name 
 Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same

 Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang 
 Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy 
 Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Some pop, some lock, some move robotic 
 Like cash money I stay in pocket 
 U.M.C. r-r-r-rock, don't stop it 
 Chicks exotic, mix Hpnotiq 
 Superhero role boy, I'm bionic 
 You a fad on some level, I'm a supersonic 
 Girl, you 'bout it, you can strip like comic 
 And trance to melodic Technotronic 
 Beats knockin', seats droppin' 
 Seeds poppin', streets rockin' 
 Freakin', shakin, money makin' 
 Stylin' and being fly 
 I'm the one the ladies-ladies chose to 
 Strip and pose to, take off their clothes to 
 Toast to the one that go coast to coast to 
 Mr. Global, the focal, let's go, uhh 
  
 [Hook: Pharrell] 
 This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line

 Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy 
 Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 I am a renegade, I never been afraid 
 Fresh and I'm get-tin paid 
 The future future of this age! 
 From the Chi so I talk this way 
 Twist the hay and the Grand Marnier 
 Rock the fly shit like every day 
 To the top and I'm on my way, let's go, uhh 
  
 [Hook: Pharrell]

 Yeah yeah 
 This is common 
 Shout outs to No I.D 
 Shout outs to Chicago 
 Good music 
 Yeah what up, what up ye, love 
 Yo, this is my sixteen bars 
  
 Feed live souls with two fish and five loaves 
 Teach a man to cook it for survival 
 My dad said it rained on my arrival 
 Not a storm of the brain makes these niggas drive slow 
 Like I was five-O but my creeds Apollo 
 On a rocky road with Dakota's live show 
 For those before I came I make the song cry for 
 Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low 
 This is that, Kilimanjaro, like twitter you can follow 
 It may be hard to read like hiero, glyphics 
 Written on the walls of Cairo 
 Check my youth revival, truth inside flow 
 I ‘stan’ like Em there with Dido 
 Crash party any live ho is liable to get banged like gangs that rival, tribal slang 
 From the primal brain kill the game and watch it die slow 
 The Ali MC, I fight for more than the title, ya idol[Intro] 
 (Yo man, brothers out here saying you should come on a gangsta tip, and other brothers out here saying you should come on a smooth tip. You know what, be yourself and just take it EZ, you know what I'm saying?) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm (easy!) easy, easy like Sunday morning 
 I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning 
 Ahhh, Common's comin' with that old "oh excuse me" 
 Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a doozie 
 Doogie, Howser, cause see, I'm like Bowser 
 Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt 
 And the trousers, how's the Family Ties? 
 I'm left with the gift, open it up, SURPRISE! 
 Big Mac, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder, french fries 
 Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaes and apple pies 
 And a cup? Nah, that's enough of that 
 I'm like an Indian giver, yo, give me that back! 
 Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector 
 We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta 
 Common infector, smug MC, heads up! 
 Ya better duck cause muthafuck', it's me 
 [Now what's your name] Common 
 Come in again... Common 
 [How would you do it] Common 
 [Now how was she] Common, check it out! 
 Common is coming soon to a theater near you 
 To the UAC crew, enough respect due 
 Do I do, when I do, where I do 
 I do, do, do, yo I do it on the ease 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I be kicking it with the doubly-dope rhymer 
 I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sliiiii-mer! 
 (Who ya gonna call?) Ghostbuster 
 I'm Petey Wheatstraw, and I'm just a 
 Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec 
 But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check 
 So I checked myself, before self got buck 
 Wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate 
 To a state, and matriculate, yo I had to elevate 
 You can tell it's great, cause I'm state 
 Off 87, the South side of Chicago 
 Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go 
 And I know I ain't did nothing [hell naw] 
 The district think I be just a lil trick kid fronting 
 UAC got my back if there's any contact 
 In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat 
 And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight 
 I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State 
 And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia 
 I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia 
 Holy-molia, it's totally awesome 
 The survey says, I gets more skins than Richard Dawson 
 But I won't catch mono or no type of disease 
 Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease (Yeah!) 
  
 [Interlude] 
 On the ease, (Check it out!) On the ease (How?) 
 On the ease, (Now here we go!) On the ease (Yeah!) 
 On the ease, (Check it out!) On the ease 
 (Take it EZ!) 
 (Yeah... In fact, it's feeling so good, let's take it all the way back to the '50s! 
 Sing it!) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boo 
 I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper 
 Two-steppin' through, yodel-le-hee-hoo! 
 Oui oui ma cherie, et comment allez vous? 
 (Contraire mon frere) Ok, truth or dare: 
 Is it true that I'm dope? (Yeahhhh!) 
 Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo 
 A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop 
 I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker 
 I'm shaking-and-baking and taking, cause I'm the back-board 
 Break her arm and feather, whipping the wonder when she activates 
 Hold up! My drawers are in my crack, [aight] pass the tape 
 Time to activate, and ejaculate 
 This is the period where I menstruate (What!?) 
 I meant to say demonstrate 
 I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball 
 In the corner pocket, count em, buck it 
 A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone 
 C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll 
 Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll 
 Of Khomein, my domain is infinite 
 Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick 
 And to the hip-hop shop, the future shock 
 When we started kickin on the one two, and ya don't stop 
 But the buck stops here buckaroo 
 Ya got your instructions, now you know what to do 
 Take it EZ! 
  
 (Man... Matter of fact, we're gonna take it EZ so straight, so nice, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna STOP!!!)[Produced by Cocaines 80´s & No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Lil Mark get shot, Lil Reese and them 
 Little niggas, it's hard to find peace in them 
 Chiraq, they say it's Middle Easterin' 
 Put your flames in the air for the deceased to them 
 Young soldiers who never got to become older 
 Dogtagged in the body bag 
 Police kept the knot he had 
 Plus he had weed in his system 
 Never knew at 13 they could enlist them 
 Momma kissed him, body was colder 
 She was shaking, I tried to hold her 
 Tears on my shoulder, he was supposed to 
 Be going to his junior year, this is his funeral year 
 Pall-bearers, all looking like kids 
 Some faces show anger, some show tears 
 No mustaches, no beards 
 Probably had the same aspirations as his 
 On a mission, staring in the distance 
 It never stop like the Muslims and Christians 
 We under-21 gun salute them 
 Just to go back and recruit them 
 I'm talkin' 'bout war 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 To all the killas and the hundred dolla billas 
 Real hittas who ain't got no feelins 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 There's a war going on inside, no man is safe from, goin on 
 Going on, there's a war going on inside, no man is safe from 
 Or can escape from, take one wars from the same place that hate from 
 Gang wars used to be about the nations 
 Now it's cliques with clips and hittas is missing 
 They hit the innocent now they families miss him 
 Death do kissed him, in his last breath he wishing 
 But no option so he assume position 
 It don't stop, hittas killing women and children 
 Angels cried, that's supposed to be God's decision 
 Collisions of cliques named after rap groups 
 Except wearing Jordans instead of black boots 
 Black troops trade war stories reminiscent of Glory 
 Walk the walk of those before me since I was a shorty 
 Seen slugs and drugs and unemployment 
 Terror town y'all was my first deployment 
 The life of a soldier ain't nothing to toy with 
 I'm living in this shit while the world exploit it 
 War 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My basic training was aiming, hustling, banging, changing niggas up 
 Cause of what they did to us, nigga, I don't give a fuck 
 It's do or die in the Chi and I ain't lived enough 
 Hoping for some visitors of war, I'm a prisoner 
 Politicians they did enough, want to get rid of us 
 Hopped in the back as soon as the shots hit the truck 
 Looked at my son I could see his soul 
 Shot and killed at three years old 
  
 [Interlude] 
 War, war, war, war! 
 We are at war! 
  
 [Outro] 
 The direction was we, we came up with this concept, Nobody Smiling was really a thought that came about because of all the violence that was going on in Chicago, or that is going on. I like to say "was" cause we gon' bring it to fruition wishing that it's gonna stop. You know and uh, all the violence that was going on - it happens in Chicago but it's happening around the world in many ways. You know, it may not be to the numbers that's happening in Chicago but it's happening in the inner cities all over America so we's talking about the conditions of what's happening when I said "Nobody Smiling" but it's really a call to action[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Verse] 
 Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder 
 On a quest for love like the Proceed drummer 
 I strike like lightning and don't need thunder 
 Inhale imagination and breathe wonder 
 That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her 
 It's a cold world and niggas need summer 
 At times my going forward seems like retreat 
 As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats 
 Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets 
 There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps 
 Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages 
 My third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious 
 Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon 
 I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden 
 Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor 
 It ain't that you selling, it's your karma 
 Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown 
 Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone 
 The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy 
 Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago 
 My mind of flow is like motor key 20 
 Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty 
 Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man 
 Flip drugs and get land 
 I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him 
 And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him 
 This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming 
 I said it's here, it's here...[Nina Simone Sample] 
 Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze 
 Strange Fruit 
  
 [Hook: John Legend] 
 Dance little brother, dont give up the fight 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light 
 Dance little sister, don't give up today 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Black bodies on the wall, color from years ago 
 It's spiritual the way that them tears they fell slow 
 Roots and bruises so deep, found it hard to sleep 
 Souls lost in the heat, pray to God to keep 
 Fast forward to my pop, he nod and geeked-off the Heron 
 Still he was dead to bear arms 
 Thats where I'm from, my story ain't that different from yours 
 A blood line, a hard time, prisons and wars 
 With struggle it came rain, when it rains it pours 
 We stayed between liquor stores, and "praise the Lord" 
 Singing "we shall overcome" cause we came for more 
 We were dancing for it to rain no more 
 Though hurricanes and waves they came ashore 
 Takin' lives of the brave and poor 
 They'd ignore, us once again 
 But it was lessons in the wind 
 Of change that came from within 
 So... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Wonder if I make it to heaven, will I get a chance to party 
 And celebrate with the great black bodies 
 Im talking bout Marley, Nina, and Marcus Garvey 
 Similair to Africa the streets is our safari 
 From shanties in slums, is children with guns 
 AIDS and poverty killing our young 
 Gramps keep sayin a savior gon' come 
 For the meek and the humble favor gon' come 
 From the same trees we were hung, we can see the sun 
 In the darkest hour, our power begun 
 I write from the same place they were bleedin' from 
 I'm emceein they done until the streets is won 
 So far we've come, with so far to go 
 To do the impossible only God will know-how we do it 
 I speak it and I put it in the music 
 The struggle lives through it, its a movement so move it 
  
 [Hook] 
 Dance little brother, dont give up the fight 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light 
 Dance little sister, don't give up the day 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate 
 Celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate 
 Oooooo you got to 
 Dance little brother,(oooh) dont give up the fight.(Dont give up the fight) 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow,(oooh) the truth will come to light.(will come to light 
 Dance little sister,(ooh) don't give up the day.(dont give up today) 
 Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate[Verse 1: Syd] 
 Red wine time on the couch 
 Happy you agreed to hang out 
 Keep my head in the clouds 
 Keep them old names out your mouth 
 I can make you laugh out loud 
 We the only ones in the house 
 I can help you body wind down 
 Make this bottle disappear right now 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Let's stay in for the night 
 Maybe take a walk outside 
 Let's distance your pride 
 Me fall in love with your mind 
 If I look deep in your eyes 
 I can guess your zodiac sign 
 We ain't got nothing but time 
 We can just chill and unwind 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude 
 The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture 
 Where there's food there's vultures 
 More Tony now, back then I was Sosa 
 I was sent like a penny in a loafer 
 The 2Pac Deepak Chopra 
 On a plane drinking wine with Oprah 
 When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her 
 Black Caesar, ey o amo roma 
 Tuto biene vino rosa 
 My dominican girl she loves soca 
 Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA 
 Most of my friends at home that I'm close to 
 When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture 
 Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper 
 Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound 
 I'm bound to the underground 
 Breaking walls down for the black and brown 
 A activist is active now 
 How far will you go for exposure? 
 Little homie in the paint tryna post up 
 Don't make me have to put you on a poster 
 Posterized by what I vocalize 
 Weathered the storm like I know the skies 
 Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise 
 These signs of the times are notarized 
 Written by the lord of the skies mortalized 
 In us, I got cold through cruel winters 
 Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda 
 Never been good with pretenders 
 They lying on the king like Simba 
 Dinner, branzino and red wine 
 Quality shared time 
 Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time 
  
 [Verse 3: Elena] 
 Red like my lips 
 Blue like past thoughts 
 Brown like your eyes 
 Just enough time 
 I can't think now 
 You're too close and I… 
 Might be too nice 
 These New York nights 
 Got me taking chances 
 I think your hands 
 Might look just right 
 If they held mine 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get two glasses 
 Now I'm swimming 
 Off the deep end 
 Heightened senses 
 No pretending 
 Make my head spin 
 I like dancing 
 In my bedroom 
 It's just me and you 
 Put that tape on 
 Tell me what you want 
 Let's just make time feel, long 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 You could just stay for the night 
 Here, let me turn down the lights 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 You can let go 
 Passion comes from down below 
 We go together like so 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Let's make a toast 
 That we both can make the most of this time 
 Red wine[Intro] 
 Check it on the one, yo Com is gonna come (3x) 
 And check it out, ha 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My raps do laps around tracks and adapt 
 To any environment.. I'm the comma comma chameleon 
 I use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags 
 That was when bitches had Gucci bags 
 And wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas 
 Hoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures 
 8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come 
 Fights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one 
 We'd come to the get-together with whoever 
 You wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together 
 Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew 
 And then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all 
 That was when mad was tall and phat was cold 
 The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town 
 As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down 
 But the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down 
 We'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear 
 Have enough for a Polish and car fare 
 I stare, at what use to be better 
 And think about who use to cop our liquor 
 (Who?) Our neighborhood father figure 
  
 [Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)] 
 I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I got more rhymes than The Manor got folks 
 Had style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats 
 And penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines 
 We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme 
 It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop 
 Skeeter would hit from the same spot 
 'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down 
 Put your body in motion only the strong survive 
 But on the 6 or the 5 
 Live is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet 
 Ball Club with music by, Andre Hatchett 
 Or either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties 
 We'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell "Aight, now money!" 
 Sauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare 
 I liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there 
 Whitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks 
 But mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with 
 The best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions 
 Cut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that) 
 Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work 
 Bust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt 
  
 [Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)] 
 I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster 
 Took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster 
 Then HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap 
 You was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say "Up your hat." 
 What you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit 
 Either fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full 
 My drink then was Boone's and Red Bull 
 I remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool 
 I thought I was cool, with my "Members Only" and a bald fade 
 Walk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade 
 And soft brush, as we got older we would stalk, rush, and bang fags 
 Go to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas 
 In games of Off the Wall, and softball, "Piggy one" I would call 
 When I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie 
 Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy 
  
 [Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)] 
 I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um 
 (Niggas be rollin) 
 We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm 
 (Niggas be rollin)

 What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get.. 
 Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get.. 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it 
 Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it 
 My heart, you came to visit 
 Stay extended 
 The lap of love we lay up in it 
 Days is vivid same incentive 
 The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it 
 A house is not a home unless we staying in it 
 Stay committed 
 I used to get around now I'm staying centered 
 Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented 
 The mentality, we all casualties 
 I can't do this casually actually you challenge me 
 To balance me 
 Paid dues and salaries 
 Been through truths and fallacies 
 The unfamiliarity made me loose calories 
 In a house with wine playing Amy's "Valerie" 
 Then I realized the past ain't my reality 
 On love's balcony, you standing out for me 
 This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly 
 Now I see 
  
 [Hook: PJ] 
 What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get.. 
 Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get.. 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it 
 Vivrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing 
 So many things that you provide the king 
 You too fly, never should you hide your wings 
 The awakening, let's keep breaking things 
 Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through 
 Breaking walls, sacred thoughts 
 Are the oceans that we make it cross 
 The truth is a naked cloth 
 No need to take it off, the wait is off 
 Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable 
 State in you relating to the faith in you 
 Awaken to what faith can do 
 Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable 
 To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable 
 I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya 
 Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture 
 A mixture of love, laughter, scripture 
 The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya 
 I'm with ya 
  
 [Hook: PJ] 
 What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get.. 
 Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get..[Verse] 
 How should I begin? 
 This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn 
 As I say it, the spirits enwhip me 
 He was raised in the belly of the city 
 Chicago, discovered by du Sable 
 A Black Frenchman that I had to mention 
 Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end 
 47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline 
 Know Grandma Mable did the best she could 
 You know how young niggas want a testy hood 
 There he stood, taller than most black boys 
 One of the best ballers out of Illinois 
 College in Ohio, this is like his bio 
 Talks that we had, man, they was never idle 
 He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible 
 He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival 
 He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital 
 He said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal 
 Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver 
 Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center 
 6'9", big heart, big mind 
 He he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time 
 He did in a way, he made to the ABA 
 And the things he say on my record 
 When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message" 
 It was his messages in the life I would step with 
 Didn't see him much, spirits are connected 
 The Father creates it, the son can reflect it 
 His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy 
 His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant 
 His perspective: somehow it shaped me 
 His perspective: undoubted I feel it 
 He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him 
 I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em" 
 The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one 
 Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication 
 Breathing heavy, he talked reparations 
 He said, "Son, we live through our generations" 
 Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons playing 
 In the background, he was talking, I was praying 
 Our Father, take care of my father 
 As far as he went, may I go farther 
 May our dreams and legacies live through our children 
 Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him 
  
 [Pops talking] 
 You know the other day I got a phone call. I got a message says pops you been gon from home too long. So I set my bags down and headed to 87th street. I was just back in the neighborhood ya know cruising the same street that I used to cruise in my long black Fleetwood. Listening to the Minister and Dr. King and my beloved brother Malcolm. First thing is see I'm boundless with spiritual energy. I wanna talk about the moral necessities of human justice. The power and the action of God-given dignity. One can not enter the gate if you hate. You gotta take the lead for the rest of the world, 87th is the street of knowledge. The streets of knowledge are all over the world. We got a possibility again of leading the world. Chi my Chi we gon ask you for safe passage for the kids to walk to school. Alright, my young homies, we got a mission to finish. We got the unborn that we got to provide the truth for 
  
 [Tasha Cobbs] 
 I gotta be honest it's so much different without you here 
 But I have no fear 
 I'll see you when I get there 
 To that city bright and fair 
 You were all I needed you to be 
 And now I thank you for all you gave for me 
 So Father, I stretch my hands to Thee 
 No other help I know 
 If you withdraw yourself from me 
 Somebody tell me where, oh where shall I go? 
  
 Father, I stretch my hands to Thee 
 No other help I know 
 If you withdraw yourself from me 
 Tell me where, oh where shall I go?[Produced by No I.D.]

 Popular girls always wanna pop in my world 
 I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay 
 In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid 
 Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while 
 You know I won't front with the style 
 Bring life to the party like a woman and child 
 From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild 
 Ah! Made the unmade-able 
 Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go 
 Me and cuzzo talked the hustle 
 About doing good business like Rick and Russell 
 You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time

 [Verse 1: No I.D] 
 No time to get all excited, just write it 
 From the inside let the pen slide, and spread 
 The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?) 
 Paint the canvas, givin' you my vision 
 To mold you, compose you 
 Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure 
 Words out my cipher, the life of my circle 
 Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me 
 You want me in your needle 
 Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch 
 I excite your brain til I'm out of your system 
 Beat digger, not a nigga or a niggaro 
 I figure you're the winner of the bread 
 Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head 
 (Yo, kid kinda nice) 
 From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise 
 Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight 
 And then fight the night 
 With a light to gain sight make your competition say aight 
 No I.D. from the city with a beach on thirty-first 
 Making all butt crews disperse 
 I'm in my own world 
  
 [Hook] (x4) 
 Yeah yeah, now check the method 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I say pay attention boy, I say uk look at here 
 I want you to see me; when you do, you look in fear 
 I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina 
 My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture 
 When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me 
 I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me 
 Cheap ass niggas, go and purchase it 
 I ain't do all this work for shit 
 My style's my child I gave birth to it 
 Like an immaculate conception, clean I came 
 Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name 
 I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes 
 It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes 
 I love black thighs, you sisters better realize 
 The real hair and real eyes get real guys 
 So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind 
 I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like 
 "I can't believe it! I got shot!" 
 Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick 
 But I got the Rid, for my dick 
 And the crab MC's that be all over it 
 Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb? 
 I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall 
 I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel 
 I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in 
 Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in 
 I be like, "You don't know me... fool" 
 And color him purple (why?), 'cause he ain't in my circle 
 Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out 
 I'm in my own world[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Intro: Adrian Younge + Common] 
 Gluttony, baby 
 To me, it's what I see 
 Gluttony, baby 
 Is us, it's hard to see 
 It's knocking 
 Gluttony, baby 
 To me, it's what I see 
 Man, they gon', they gon' 
 Man they gon' knock this 
 And ride out to this 
  
 [Verse] 
 It sit deep in my chest, so let me express 
 Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address 
 It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious 
 The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest 
 The streets was a mess, and they still are 
 Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed 
 But the game is the game, so let it begin 
 In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins 
 Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity 
 A hustler's insanity can break up the family 
 Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change 
 Knowing that he'll end up in a grave 
 It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans 
 Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting 
 Like the second is something we all have 
 Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath 
 I seen a boss take it out on his staff 
 Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath 
 Never seen a man making money while he mad 
 So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math 
 Now the third, you probably heard from MOP 
 They say use them rocks to make 'em envy 
 Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony 
 When niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity 
 They hate it, to see you celebrated 
 Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it 
 Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth 
 Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth 
 Want you to break em off, getting money it costs 
 For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off 
 Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat 
 It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street 
 It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels 
 So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move 
 He is never full and he gon' want your food 
 Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule 
 The sixth is a fix that's in all of us 
 When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust 
 When the drawers go down, the guards go down 
 Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now 
 Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe 
 Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed 
 Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other 
 Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff 
 Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off 
 Before I sign off, in the sins we livin' 
 The good thing is we can be forgiven 
  
 [Outro] 
 Seven deadly sinsIntro: Common 
  
 Yeah, one two, bless 
 Yeah yeah, check it 
 I got my mellow Sean Lett 
 He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style 
 Eighty-seven, you know the bidness, check it 
  
 Chorus: Common, Sean Lett 
  
 After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking 
 The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking 
  
 After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking 
 The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking 
  
 Verse One: Common 
  
 Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet 
 Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted 
 Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game 
 Hoes in the stable, none do I claim 
 Niggas with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim 
 Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain 
 In the midst of precipitation, I make the power 
 Manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations 
 Got connections in the nation 
 To incarceration, to general population 
 More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me 
 You got a tattoo? Bitch youse a freak to me 
 Seeking the, good sess material 
 Asking when's my next video 
 Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university 
 Enroll your youngun in a nursery 
 And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself 
 You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself 
 I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways 
 To make it in the last days, now bring it on 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Verse Two: Sean Lett 
  
 I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world 
 Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl 
 Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child 
 I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle 
 Better school her, so presence is your seed in society 
 Parks of envy jealous niggas crack fiends yes indeed 
 I won't misleed and you can best believe 
 I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need 
 See I know right now, you're just too young to understand 
 Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands 
 Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain 
 Why having you, created just an everlasting shame 
 Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked 
 Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk 
 Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo 
 Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggas in these streets won't do 
 Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying 
 Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams 
 See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed 
 Niggas store up theirs and down opposite signs 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Outro: Sean Lett, Common 
  
 It's like that y'all (yeah yeah) 
 Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all 
 Sean Lett 
  
 We gonna get down like that 
 My man Eddie C on the board 
 We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street 
 Seventy-first and everybody in South show 
 We coming through for niggas on the West side 
 Down in the ickies, all up and down state 
 We gonna keep it straight like that 
 We straight out for gold 
 You call it Chi-town it's still our town 
 Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound 
  
 We talking about rocking niggas state to state nationwide 
 On the real it's like that 
 Straight up South side is where we loaf 
 Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious 
 YouknowhatI'msayin? Hear me 
 You know what? We out though[Intro: Snoh Aalegra] 
 Black and blue outside her soul 
 Carries a heart of gold 
 Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on 
 The child she brings in to the world don't know 
 Right from wrong 
 Her soul is sore, she deserves more 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Red lipstick bo', French press col' 
 You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold 
 Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid 
 She far from a dummy funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money 
 At the club going hard like liquor 
 Shots of Ciroc she can out drink a nigga 
 Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her mover her shake her you can't fake her 
 She knows time is paper 
 Glaciers on her neck-uh 
 Pleasures on her finger 
 Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh 
 Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer 
 Beamer benz she got friends 
 She got friends in high ends 
 She know trend she know when 
 She go in like an investor 
 Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla 
 Ain't about all that extra 
 Destiny brought her to where niggas bought her, a lot of shit 
 She ain't caught up bitches taught her to hustle 
 Hustle harder than a nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Common (Dreezy)] 
 (Uh huh) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (True) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 She bad, uh uh, she bad 
 Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag 
 Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett 
 Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet 
 She fasted for a week that's stronger than most 
 If she had kids she could mother father them both 
 Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody 
 Devil in a tight dress something that is golly 
 She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt 
 Hotel suite at the Trump 
 The way she walk in them pumps 
 Talkin' 'bout takin' over the world while holding a blunt 
 She hold her man down when her man get locked up 
 Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's 
 Used to seel hot purses and network marketing 
 Eye shadow darker than them dudes she like 
 An actress her life is so movie like 
 She hustle harder than a nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Common (Dreezy)] 
 (Uh huh) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (True) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
 She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) 
  
 [Verse 3: Dreezy] 
 Uh, Dreezy 
 Look 
 I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini 
 I make it happen I would never need a genie 
 Went and got zucchini 
 Threw away that fettuccine 
 I been going to the gym I'm tryna get in that bikini 
 I'ma, smart chick but I never went to Harvard 
 I'm like a Nina got designer for my armor 
 Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara 
 I'm harder, at these niggas heads like a Barber 
 This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby 
 Who Probably driving a Honda but saving for that Mercedes 
 This is for my pretty women that know that they independent 
 You say that her shit is rented she probably get offended, man 
 The new kid like a transfer 
 I'm known to set trends let them copy like the answers 
 I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers 
 Shots fired I got harder than a, nigga 
  
 [Outro] 
 Afternoon, breezy afternoon too, the winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare 
 High today 62, maybe some rain tonight, a low of 40 degrees 
 60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lakefront at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 60[Chorus]

 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I’m from Chicago, nobody’s smiling 
 Niggas wylin' on Stoney Island 
 Where the chief and the president come from 
 Pop out, pop pills, pop guns 
 On the deck when the opps come 
 Pop some, ops run 
 This ain’t a game nigga, ain’t no options 
 Nigga selling on the block like an auction 
 Dig into my pockets, see a profit 
 Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is 
 Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot holding money like a hostage 
 She went ostrich, from the projects with posture 
 I draw with the goddess like an artist 
 Getting paper with no margins, money gods 
 I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin 
  
 [Chorus]

 [Verse 2: Common] 
 In the Chi ain’t a damn thing funny 
 Thinking of ways to get money 
 Drive down Lake Shore, scheming how to make more 
 If we ain’t eating together what is this cake for? 
 Ain’t nobody giving it, that’s what we take for 
 Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for 
 Glaciers of ice, lasers, and lice 
 Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice 
 Made for the life, fall out like we out of bounds 
 Bars and guns, niggas got a lot of rounds 
 Tripping like you from out of town 
 The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound 
 Ain’t no fathers 'round, sons of anarchy 
 Fighting attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny 
 At the party with the thots with the extra body 
 I’m in the inner city, it’s an out of body experience

 [Verse 3: Malik Yusef] 
 Face on T-shirts with no hashtags 
 Just big ass trash bags tagged hash 
 Out here shit been trill 
 Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag’s cash 
 Five versus six, Star Wars 
 No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors 
 Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9’s 
 Two trey 8’s, and one 45 
 Tryna get to 23, numbers game 
 Then here come the fame 
 But they won’t say no names 
 Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town 
 I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around 
 Popes, bishops, disciples, stones 
 Counts, princes, lords, queens, and kings 
 They drilling on my land but ain’t no oil to be found 
 I might be part of the problem 
 I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up 
 Most of them can’t even moonwalk 
 My little cousin Bump J don’t know what he did when he introduced that goon talk 
 Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don’t know about? 
 So many shortys have tried out for the role 
 That’s why he slide out and ride out with the pole 
 Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn’t keep the lights on 
 Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you 
 Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on 
 How long will they mourn me after I’m out of mind, out of sight, gone 
 A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most 
 G.O.O.D. music in the building, yeah we got ghostwriters 
 They just actually ghosts[Intro: Minister Louis Farrakhan] 
 A man whose genius and freedoms and— 
 Ability to communicate and— 
 To talk, and to touch chords— 
 A man who has the ability and the audacity 
 And the unmitigated gall God to stand up, to stand up 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice on the throne 
 Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home 
 I was told to write a song for the people 
 Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence 
 Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other 
 On how we sisters and brothers 
 Cover the land and corners with poems and stone 
 Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it 
 Even though I authored it, let no one margin it 
 And make it all about paper or first week's sales 
 Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell 
 Those that fell off the path, bring 'em back to the math 
 Your staff will be your microphone 
 Your name is Common, you was born to fight the norm 
 Take house niggas outta darkness 'til they lights is on 
 I'ma put a hyphen on your name: rapper-actor-activist 
 You the one that can reach into the black abyss 
 Stars that's asterisks, show 'em what a classic is 
 Freedom riders need passengers 
 In your lyrics use scriptures and passages 
 To make them rise like Lazarus and resurrect it again 
 They'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again 
 Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin' 
 If they don't like it, shake the dust and say "fuck em" 
 Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I'm happy to be in any place 
 Where God's name is remembered 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Trouble of this world, trouble of this world 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Going home to live, going home to live 
 Going home to live with God 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Go into the wilderness like Musa on a pilgrimage 
 Streets are villages, speak with diligence and authority 
 The fake are the Pharisees and Sadducees 
 Give them that Garvey free from the Black Odyssey 
 Yo pardon me, you the God bodily 
 Functioning on earth as a part of me, that's why I gave you artistry 
 Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers 
 Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us 
 Tell sisters they earths and goddesses 
 If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless 
 Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near 
 You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear 
 You'll appear in the circles in Hollywood, I birth you 
 In Chicago, you know how to parlay good 
 You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys, give those to your family 
 Don't get caught up in the vanity or the world's insanity 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Trouble of this world, trouble of this world 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Going home to live, going home to live 
 Going home to live with God 
  
 [Outro] 
 To those of you who are unfamiliar with those words 
 They mean, in English, 'Peace, be unto you'[Intro: John Legend] 
 The wind against my face, tells me that I must go 
 Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me 
 When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA 
 So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
  
 [Verse 1: John Legend] 
 The last note I sang was in Beaver Falls, PA 
 At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name 
 But I knew I could and work that  all on my dreams 
 They tell me find that place, find that place 
  
 [Hook: John Legend] 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
  
 [Verse 2: John Legend] 
 Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination 
 With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today 
 Constantly it's on my mind 
 I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration 
 Oh, I've got to cross this nation 
  
 [Hook: John Legend] 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 As the rain falls down from the heavens 
 Think of how far I came since '87 
 Took my hustle and made it a weapon 
 I was always told "in the pain there's a blessing" 
 Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons 
 Talking with God, I asked clearer questions 
 Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for? 
 If so? Then what am I stressing for? 
 We tight, then why can't I let it go? 
 Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor 
 Let it rain cause it's ancestral 
 Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you 
 Let it rain and come down visceral 
 For those no longer here in the physical 
 Let it rain cause it's like tears from you 
 Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do 
 Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful 
 So that it can service you and return to you 
 Let it rain, let the rain surround me 
 And never drown me, I was lost when it found me 
 Now in a dream is where I'll be 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Now in a dream is where I'll be 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be 
  
 [Hook: John Legend] 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain[Common (with Badu singing in background)]

 During divine hours, I use mind power to refine 
 Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls 
 Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world 
 It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl 
 Ma-sons build in lodges, we be in garages 
 Discussin' who we boned and who God is 
 Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners 
 I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners

 Check it, check it 
 I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail 
 Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell 
 Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale 
 Wild hair and rock smells make the cops tail 
 My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought 
 With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court 
 I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk 
 I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk 
 I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel 
 Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago 
 E Bottom, here's the bottle 
 I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel 
 (come on bay-bayyy) Bust it

 A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense 
 The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses 
 Opportunity and the beat knocks 
 Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year 
 Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash' 
 Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks 
 Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike 
 Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight 
 Like a construction worker, when it's time to build 
 Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill 
 In perserverence I'mma find a meal, and provoke 
 My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat 
 It go..

 Check it 
 I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat 
 Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street 
 On the, street of desire my body and soul meet 
 Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat 
 Had the cold feet for a second 
 Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions 
 Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection 
 In the mirror I only heard my reflection 
 Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections 
 And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections 
 I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents 
 Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips 
 Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with 
 Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich 
 Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County 
 To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven 
 Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell? 
 Why is this choice Hell?

 Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack 
 This miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack 
 Bruise rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged 
 Something different from these hollering and grunting niggas 
 This is business strictly, step to my business is risky 
 'Specially when you as bitch as Missy 
 Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game 
 With a four-pounded brainstorm 
 To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game 
 Used to breakdance, it's a shame 
 What money do to a nigga brain 
 If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain? 
  
 [Hook] 
 "Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it" 
 "C O double M O to the N" (cut and scratched 4x) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off 
 Trying to get his work off to customers 
 I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas 
 See shirts that say "We gotta get over" 
 That jiggy shit is over, the war is on 
 I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture 
 Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark 
 For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark 
 Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart 
 Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts 
 I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack 
 A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap 
 Generation I "X" cats like a Muslim 
 He fell off cause I pushed him 
 Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion 
 I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him 
  
 [Hook] 
 "Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it" 
 "C O double M O to the N" (cut and scratched 4x) 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came 
 Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane 
 Then Snoop released and it became a G thang 
 Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs 
 Niggas ain't hate you, they ain't paying you no attention 
 In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned 
 With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good 
 From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood 
 From what a nigga says to what's understood 
 Keep my shit tight like them boys in "The Wood" 
 Dick is always hard like the "Boyz in the Hood" 
 Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi 
 At the crib some cats give me the cold eye 
 I'm a bitch slap the next one 
 Let him know the world is my section for taking 
 You got to use aggression 
  
 [Hook] 
 "Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"

 Yeah, one two.. 
 Yeah, where my nigga Jay Dee? 
 Where ya at? (Yeah!) 
  
 [Hook: J Dilla] 
 Say you got guns, then bring that shit 
 Say you got ones, then bring that shit 
 Cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this 
 Me and my mans is bout to spit some hot shit 
 Yeah, one two 
 Bout to spit that, hot shit 
 Huh whoo! Yeah 
 Turn it down nigga, hot shit 
 Yea 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Messenger in the Metropolis; apocalypse here and now 
 Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style 
 I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit 
 Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets 
 Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose 
 To let y'all niggas know the demo 
 Voice is a instrument that's monumental 
 You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho 
 Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye 
 I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas makin moves 
 That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed 
 I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets 
 Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens 
 I lecture how I got God but don't got religion 
 Got a clip for these niggas on the net, sellin my shit 
 Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit 
 In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps 
 And people that travel at the speed of need 
 Never agree with the ways of the world 
 Cats say anything - like they say to they girl 
 How you bringin it when you sit Indian style? 
 Niggas know me as Com it's time hear me go wild 
 With hot shit, yeah 
 Hot shit, yeah, one two 
 Came to bring it boy 
  
 [Hook: J Dilla] 
 (You say you got guns, then bring that shit 
 You say you got ones, then bring that shit 
 Cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this 
 (to get my man see we bout to spit some hot shit 
 What? No doubt hot shit 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Old men see visions young men dream dreams 
 I rock the planet - recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M 
 Com Rules Everything and everything is 
 How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his 
 Scary the biz is like "The Blair Witch Project" 
 Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project 
 State senators, life twirls, most sell out 
 - like a dread with a white girl 
 You want me to cypher with you and the Gods? 
 I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads 
 Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck 
 Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch 
 You'll get split like a date that's dusk scuffed and scraped up 
 Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say 
 You rap like a nigga that's about to spray 
 Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say 
 Feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day 
 What I write is a passage for niggas to travel through 
 Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you 
 I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone 
 Turn the cell off and let my dome roam 
 Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable 
 I write fatal bringin niggas to life 
 A wise man came in the thick of the night 
 He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic 
 I said, "What shit?" 
 He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit 
  
 [Hook: J Dilla 
 (You say you got guns, then bring that shit) uhhh 
 (You say you got ones, then bring that shit 
 Cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this) uhh 
 (me and my man, see we known to spit this) HOT SHIT 
 Hot shit, yeah, yeah, uhh 
 What we spit Jay? (Throw it down nigga) 
 HOT SHIT, uh, yeah, uh, c'mon, yeah (keep it goin) 
 HOT SHIT.. 
 HOT SHIT.. 
 HOT SHIT.. yeah, boy (keep it goin) 
 HOT SHIT.. out 
 HOT..[Verse 1: Chris Brown] 
 Baby, does he do it for you? 
 When he's finished, does he step back and adore you? 
 I just gotta know, cause your time is money 
 And I won't let him waste it, ooh no no 
 Baby, just go with it 
 Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different 
 We can take it slow or act like you're my girl let's skip the basics, woah oh 
  
 [Bridge: Chris Brown] 
 He's so replaceable 
 You're worth the chase, you put it on 
  
 [Hook: Chris Brown] 
 It's alright, I'm not dangerous 
 When you're mine, I'll be generous 
 You're irreplaceable 
 A collectible, just like fine china 
  
 [Verse 2: Chris Brown] 
 Favorite, you're my favorite 
 It's like all the girls around me don't have faces 
 And the saying goes 
 Life is just a game but I'm not playing, woah oh 
  
 [Bridge: Chris Brown] 
  
 [Hook 2x: Chris Brown] 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Defined by your fineness 
 From behind I watch you, you timeless 
 Come sit next to your highness 
 Get your nails done in different climates 
 Indian hair, that's from China 
 Stay open all night, you my diner 
 You a definition of a rider 
 Our sex is on house arrest, I stay inside ya 
 We could be best friends, me, you and diamonds 
 Climax and keep climbing, I hand you refinement 
 Like an assignment and watch you work that shit 
 We spend time and money cause you worth that shit 
 You could be dirty or Princess Diana 
 Cause you know the streets of Paris to Atlanta 
 Glamour with a panoramic view for me to scan her 
 I love this sister like I'm Tony Montana 
 School her with grammar 
 Get her mind in a golden state like Hammer 
 Shine bright like a gamma, ray with the things that I say 
 Make her want to love, honor and obey 
 I could be your Thriller, you could be my Ola Ray 
 You my fine china girl, I never throw away 
  
 [Hook: Chris Brown] 
  
 [Verse 4: Chris Brown] 
 Took me awhile to find, your love 
 Ain't no amount of time, in this world 
 Save me a lot of time, and just love me 
 Dearly baby, feel it in your soul 
 Are you ready? 
 I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me 
  
 [Hook: Chris Brown][Verse 1] 
 Sitting on stairs, in street affairs 
 Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs 
 His voice rare, talk with a mumble 
 Chicago Bear hat, quarterback the huddle 
 Call an audible of trouble came 
 His name Chris, black as his hustle name 
 Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game 
 Watch him winning, hope your team do the same 
 A menace, he O-Dog, Caine 
 Wish a nigga would go against his grain 
 Used to staying but moved up in the game 
 Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame 
 The fortune of a caine, long live his reign 
 He do it for a son, he do it with a gun 
 Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done 
 A team full of hitters, so they hit and run 
 The priest don't even want none 
 Walk with the G's cause the G's never run 
 Something to be from the slum and be the one 
 This is where he at, this is where he from 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 "Where I'm from" 
 "Where I'm from" 
 "Where I'm from"

 Living life with no fear 
 Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear 
 Told her that dudes gon' want some ass 
 And whatever you do, do it with class 
 She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it 
 You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it 
 It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning 
 Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning 
 With a tile around my neck, a style around respect 
 Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec 
 They fire, drill, stop dropping roll 
 I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold 
 The way of the road is our ode to the legacy 
 C'mon dog, you know my pedigree 
 Finding Forever, Be, the sun never set on me 
 Many reign, but the game never weather me 
 If I'm in the building it mean I got equity 
 Wearin' articles of black like Ebony 
 Since I was a shorty I was thinking longevity 
 No fear, I say that with levity 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 "Where I'm from" 
 "Where I'm from"

 "Where I'm from" 
 "Where I'm from" 
 "Where I'm from"[Common talking] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean 
 I'm a Person In Making Profit 
 See, I pimp internationally 
 I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted 
 I pimp with the truth, that's the only method 
  
 [Common] 
 Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin' 
 And Chevy windows be rattlin' 
 And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts 
 Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched 
 Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig 
 Asked her the name, one way to approach her 
 See she had game, she needed me to coach her 
 Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture 
 The way a righteous pimp is supposed to 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune 
 I ain't having it like abortion 
 Walking with this stick holding his tip 
 Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp 
 It was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride 
 Act like I didn't see him I tried 
  
 [Common] 
 Motion denied (pause) 
 I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers 
 She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators 
 Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure 
 That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand 
 I'm a take you to a pimps promise land 
 Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya 
  
 Chorus: Bilal (singing) 
  
 Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god 
 Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god 
  
 [Common] 
 (Hey girl, come on over here, check it out) 
 Make your next move your best move, choose me 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 How I look working for a nigga in a kufi? 
 If I was on a track you couldn't produce me 
 With them shits on your wrist looking goofy 
  
 [Common] 
 (Yeah, OK) 
 I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel 
 You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level 
 You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang 
 Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 Nigga, you must not know of me 
 I'm the mack here 
 Ought to have you ho for me (Common: Get real now) 
 Pimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry 
 I'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me 
  
 [Common] 
 You know why? 
 I'm thinking bigger than baguettes, furs, and slick cars 
 Or have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars 
 If you become mine the world would be ours 
 Respect the game, and universal laws 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall 
 (Common: Try it) 
 Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball? 
 I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving 
 We can't ride together 'cause you ain't driving 
 (Common: Oh, it's like that) 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Common] 
 (This, this, this really how I look at it, check it) 
 You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson 
 Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 Think I'm gon' risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: Yep) 
 That shit is the past, I got my own stable (Common: Where at?) 
 I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track 
 Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract 
  
 [Common] 
 Girl, you getting beside yourself 
 I'm trying to guide you 
 Help you see inside yourself 
 I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light 
 Have you covering your body and have you eating right 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 (Is that right?) 
 I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what?) 
 Pimp rhythms, pimp flows 
 Pimp men (Common: And pimp what?) 
 Pimp systems 
 Got stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?) 
 Down South 
 In Texas I ran the best ho house 
  
 [Common] 
 (So) 
 I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo 
 Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou 
 (MC Lyte: Yeah right) 
 Bring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe 
 Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer 
  
 [MC Lyte] 
 (HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 
 (Common: Why you laughin'?) 
 I'm laughin' 'cause you funny 
 I make bitch niggas like you have my money 
 I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly 
 You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki 
  
 [Common] 
 Yo, whatever happened to loyalty? 
 Don't you want to become royalty? 
 On the streets selling ass and oils for me 
 But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you 
 Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher 
  
 [Common talking and Bilal singing background] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Well there you have it y'all 
 The story of pimps and hoes, y'all know how it goes 
 It's been the oldest profession 
 The whole thing is like a lesson 
 Ain't no second guessin' 
 Pimps y'all, hustlers 
 All that good shit 
 Yeah, yeah, 2000 and forever 
 It'll be here 
 Uh, uh aiight cool[Produced by No I.D.] 
  
 [Chorus: Elijah Blake] 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah, we know the deal 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 87 strip walker, I'm a shit talker 
 Fuck all night, yo, depending what I’m off of 
 Had a white girl I tossed her, black girl I lost her 
 Break bread with the Stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar 
 Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth 
 I was first with a verse, live niggas don't rehearse 
 Wear the prophets on the shirt, yeah, yeah that's the creed 
 I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave 
 I tell you when you look good and keep it right there 
 I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air 
 Jordan 3s on the feet as we breeze down Lake Shore 
 These are the days that we bake more to make more 
 I been living in the moment lately 
 It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me 
 Lady lady, that body crazy 
 You been working out of this thing, if you're not, tell me if you're really real 
  
 [Chorus: Elijah Blake] 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah, we know the deal 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I'm the sole controller, opposite of sober 
 Flow from the south side to south Angola 
 Mami wanna strip, then yeah, I'ma poke her 
 And go all in and stretch it out like yoga 
 I'm flexing, sexing, oiled up like Texas 
 Survivor, soldier, a child is destined 
 A star is born in a Chicago storm 
 The name is Common, I'm anything but the norm, uh 
 Six in the mornin' something warm informin' 
 I'm sweating like I'm performin' on tour and 
 Y'all fucking with this like porn 
 Put your fists up, cause you know I ride on 
 New planes and plateaus, made it through the black hole 
 I rhyme in a timeless capsule, I rap for 
 Niggas in the barber shops and broads that's hot 
 I run the town, I'm a fucking juggernaut 
 This shit is real 
  
 [Chorus: Elijah Blake] 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah, we know the deal 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah, we know the deal[Intro] 
 For his goodness and for his wonderful works 
 Unto the children of men 
 If my people will lift my name tonight 
 I will come in! I will be exalted! 
 I will be glorified! I will be lifted up! 
 Welcome him in tonight 
 Can't you feel him? Yes, yes 
 There is liberty 
 Open your heart tonight 
 Welcome him in, put them hands together 
 Fellowship, joy and peace 
  
 [Verse: Common] 
 All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being 
 Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom 
 See him in your son, see him in the daughters 
 The mountains, the waters, all divine order 
 The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad 
 He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem" 
 Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it? 
 The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered 
 The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it 
 True stars remain like the name of David 
 Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it 
 It ain't yours 'til you create it 
 In the image of the beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile 
 My verses go 'til Heaven and Earth become reversible 
 Christ particle, so anything is possible 
 Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 And I want the joy, joy 
 And I want to know the peace of mind 
 I'll make a way, a way to see 
 Through it all and all, living for joy and peace 
 Still in awe in the night when it hurts 
 And your bed feels like snow, there's a joy in the rain 
 In your heart, there's a way 
 Turn your light on, turn your light on 
 Turn your light on, turn your light on 
 Turn your light on, turn your light on 
 Turn your light on, turn your light on 
 Turn your light on, turn your light onGod bless... 
  
 [Hook: D'Angelo] 
 Know I love my baby; my baby loves me 
 Day gets so hectic, need a little company 
 It's quarter to eleven, time to get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto... 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto 
 Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow 
 I got my third eye on the sparrow 
 Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel 
 The mother of my child, we're not together 
 Baby, it's your back, I got forever 
 As the weather, talks to us 
 Henrock and the Holy Spirit walks through us 
 The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide 
 A thug is a lost man in disguise 
 The rise and fall 
 Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall 
 I walk through the valley with a life preserver 
 Feeling at times, that I might just murder 
 Yo, but that ain't what I was sent for 
 I want folks to say his life it meant more 
 Than any car, any rock or any broad 
 He found Geto Heaven in himself and God 
  
 [Hook: D'Angelo] 
 Geto Heaven 
 It's time to get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven 
 It's time to get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto... 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Love, your happiness don't begin with a man 
 Strong woman, why should you depend on a man? 
 I understand you want a man that's resourceful 
 If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you 
 Talking to a friend, about what love is 
 Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his 
 Hugged her from afar, said what I felt 
 You'll never find a man, till you find yourself 
 Time helps mistakes, you can learn from 
 'Cause one man fucked up, men you shouldn't turn from 
 You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too 
 At that destination, a king will anoint you 
 Going through the storm, anybody seems warm 
 That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more 
 Than anything you could cop at a store 
 For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stopping him for? 
 Not even I could ignore being alone is hard 
 Find heaven in yourself and God 
  
 [Hook: D'Angelo] 
 You know I love my baby; my baby loves me 
 My day, it gets so hectic, need a little company, yeah 
 It's 3-1-7, it's time to get some Geto Heaven 
 (Time to get some Geto Heaven) 
 Geto Heaven (Geto Heaven) it's time to get some Geto Heaven 
 Time to get some Geto Heaven, oh... 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 This music is so much bigger than me 
 As far as happy, joe, it's like a trigger to me 
 Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads 
 Record execs, at times it do be hard 
 But to choose words, and be heard across waters 
 Doing something you like to support daughters 
 Keeping your guys from collecting court orders 
 Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us 
 Thought of things to say to become the in thing for the day 
 Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it 
 Music is a gift that is sacred 
 I opened it and used it hoping you could grow to it 
 Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it 
 Can't imagine going through it, without soul music 
 It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path 
 On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep 
 And show depth, as we make people nod 
 Find heaven in this music and God 
 Find heaven in this music and God 
 Find heaven in this music and God 
  
 [Outro: D'Angelo] 
 Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah 
 Geto Heaven, my baby 
 Geto Heaven, my baby 
 Geto Heaven, my baby 
 Geto Heaven, my baby 
 Geto Heaven, my baby...Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot 
 Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it 
 What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing 
 On my own two, down with my own crew 
 Told cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off 
 When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse 
 I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight 
 Man, when it's time for some action I get red, tonight's da night 
 An eye for an eye, a life for what's right 
 Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite 
 Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct 
 I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links 
 And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith 
 Studied the missionary waitin on my life, the mic I rush like bostage 
 I switch styles like a channel with controls that is remote 
 Engage in a page, and with words I elope 
 Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the vow(el)s 
 That tie knots when I rocks like a Z-28 
 At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones 
 They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own 
 It's like that, coming from the Go rapper 
 I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that ho Patra 
 So keep on, and you don't, now come on 
 Ah keep on, and you don't 
  
 When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall 
 And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme 
 And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged 
 Like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit 
 Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit 
 My mellows call me "Never", they be like "Never's going to get it" 
 Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics 
 That's why cats be like "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" 
 Other studs come through to see what I am up to 
 They be on the dick of crew giving us weed and buying us brew 
 Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up 
 Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker 
 T. told me "You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world" 
 How you going to come off with the style that's sterile? 
 It's like that, keep on, ha ha 
 It's like that, keep on 
  
 My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cock 
 I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox 
 Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face 
 Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rap race is a rat race 
 Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you 
 Hip-hop 
 You sorry excuse for funk rap 
 Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that 
 The real shit's starting to come back 
 The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack 
 I started eating cat when I was 10 
 Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson 
 I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind 
 But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty 
 The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie 
 But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties 
 My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline 
 Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line 
 I'm slamming, jamming on the one 
 I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on[Hook: Common] 
 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I put the line down when I put the rhyme down 
 Lost on my own Stoney Island that I'm found 
 I ride around town like this is my town 
 Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound 
 Kinda arrogant cause I’m from Chi Town 
 East bound & down, that’s how we get down 
 At the bar taking shots like they live rounds 
 My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now 
 Lot that surround me, places all cloudy 
 Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy 
 You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi 
 Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey 
 Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle 
 Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up 
 Think about the come up 
 That’s why I’m always on edge when the fans seem to run up 
 Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together 
 But when the weather change, lady friend 
 You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur 
 Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh 
 I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga 
 Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor 
 The rich get richer, my dick get bigger 
 Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard 
 The more I know self, the more I know God 
 Coppin’ land from my bro Monar 
 Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate 
 Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit 
 In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit 
 The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow 
 The willingness to know that I don’t know shit 
  
 [Bridge: James Fauntleroy] 
 But I still wanna know 
 What the fuck you on girl 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do 
 It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen 
 I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream 
 Now I’m a Champagne King like Evelyn 
 Young hearts run free and forever sing 
 Yea 
  
 [Bridge: James Fauntleroy] 
 Tell me what the fuck you on 
 Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run 
  
 [Hook: Common] 
 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
  
 [Bridge: James Fauntleroy] 
 Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run 
  
 [Hook: Common] 
 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
  
 [Common] 
 It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed 
 Love shed, ‘nough said 
  
 [Bridge: James Fauntleroy] 
 But I still wanna know 
 What the fuck you’re on 
 Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run 
 And I’m down to jump the gun with you 
 Tell me what the fuck you want 
 Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run 
 And I’m down to jump the gun with you 
  
 [Verse 3: James Fauntleroy] 
 What the fuck I’m s’posed to do, you not around 
 I’m not talkin' 'bout when you're high I mean on the ground 
 Always hold you down in and outta town 
 Maybe I’m a clown got me crying out in front the crowd 
 On the inside but it feel like a fuckin’ cloud 
 Out my fuckin’ mind, I’ma fuckin’ drown 
 Girl but I’m not gonna fuck around 
 I’ma fuckin’ marry you and learn to swim 
 Let me carry you I need to hit the gym 
 Young hard jab but the difference is 
 Got young love but I’m not young 
 Faith in love but I’m not dumb 
 I don’t need to give a fuck about the outcome 
 Niggas be scared but I’m not one 
  
 [Outro: James Fauntleroy] 
 Niggas be scared but I’m not one 
 Niggas be scared but I’m not one 
 Niggas be scared but I’m not one 
 Niggas be scared but I’m not one[Interlude: Common] 
 Yeah, y'all, this is DJ Common

 I'm a child of the ahh - The 87 ahh 
 From the streets - Get on a beat and go ahh 
 I could break it down like whatever ya ahh 
 On some K-R-S be here forever type unh 
 You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like unh 
 Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh 
 Baby boy you could do it take your time do it.... 
 If you get the chance 
 To be a man in a b-boy stance and advanced from the go 
 I'll trace outer space with a unh 
 The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with 
 Bitches and....I've traveled miles with..... 
 I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual 
 Of the real unh 
 Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you 
 You sampled real unh's and then filtered 
 I'm built to last - at last I'm free 
 The Roots and SV be the family tree 
 SV and the Roots be the family tree 
 The Roots and SV and the tree is unh 
 Come on 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal & Jill Scott]

 I style for the ohhh - wild for the ohhh 
 Baby girl let's go half on a child for the ohhh 
 Lick shot's pop lock and blaow for the oohh 
 Like Ra-I'll move a crowd for the ohhh 
 You talkin' loud but ain't sayin' ohhh 
 Trickin' paper on a unh... Captain Save-a-ohhh 
 I've never been.. the type of nigga.. 
 To take.. a broad to the courts 
 As a shorty I was always into sports 
 Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's ohhh 
 Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle 
 Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle 
 Even when it sound muffled.. 
 I bust through.. narrow gates.. 
 With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped 
 Before I came up I had to elevate 
 Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to 
 You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh 
 I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp 
 Many angel's fell to the dust 
 Leavin' me to trust... only a ohhh 
 Leavin' me to trust y'all only a ohhh 
 Leavin' me to trust in a - ahh ohhh ohhh ohhh 
 Ohhh 
 Yo 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal & Jill Scott]

 Dance to the.. dance to the hey 
 Like nobody's watchin in a b-boy stance to the hey 
 I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey 
 Yo hey.. kick in the bass you.. 
 Chasin paper like a bitch in a race 
 Been on the deck, I still ain't picked up the ace 
 The hundred.. styles I run with thick in the race 
 So let's ohhh.. yeah unh hunh

 [Intro: Vinia Mojica] 
 *Singing in Spanish* 
  
 [Intro] 
 What what, we do this time 
 Rock rock.... 
 Yes, let this music travel through you 
 Talk about feelings, yeah yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo wassup world? 
 Yo what's happening? 
 It's the C-double-O and I'm back again 
 Take this back and then, tell a friend 
 Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes* 
 Time travelin *echoes* 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime 
 Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine 
 Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface 
 Though my sex drive like a car chase 
 More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase 
 Stakes are high, like my uncle is 
 We both got problems, he never confronted his 
 Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat 
 And paint a picture, raw like the first coat 
 Send my old man a note to keep his phone on 
 My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown 
 Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone 
 Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms 
 Facin the east, actions macin the beast 
 Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat 
 His lady down, it's two-thou 
 That ain't the way we lay it down 
 Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross 
 Many paid dues, but few knew the costs 
 I ran through the Moss like Randy 
 Touching down with God, close friends, and family 
 Recognize the voice in the wilderness 
 Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Time travelin, took my time in hand 
 My rhyme learn and plan 
 Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man 
 Some walk but never learn to stand 
 Still, afraid to expand what they feel 
 I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages 
 ATM's, Ericsson's 
 Loud niggas that whisper carelessness 
 If we livin in Revelation 
 Why should the people of the sun have to run? 
 Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom 
 He ask why I hadn't been to see him 
 Really, I ain't have a good reason 
 He said, "Rah, give back what you receivin" 
 In a race against time, I was caught 
 In the same game as you, but long live the sport 
 It's time travelin 
 It's the C-double-O and I'm back again 
 Take this back and then, tell a friend 
 Spaces and places you been 
 Time travelin *fades out* time travelin.... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yo wassup world? 
 Yo what's happening? 
 It's the C-double-O and I'm back again 
 Take this back and then, tell a friend 
 Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes* 
 Time travelin *echoes*Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind 
  
 Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind 
  
 [Black Thought] 
 Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price 
 Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life 
 Started out at like twelve 
 Trapped in a belly of hell 
 Grew into a man inside of a cell 
 Yo, anger just swell up 
 At a early age that develop 
 Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him 
 They said he's on a road to become a felon 
 But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon 
 He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed 
 Started making noise but they tried to mute it 
 They put him through it 
 For him to make the system look stupid, [yo] 
 They rather look you in the face and shoot it 
 And leave your spot looted [or what] 
 Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught 
 When you scream at it and do it 
 With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid 
 Don't understand the point that you at 
 Or how the hell you came to it? 
 Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson 
 They pulled him over heading home from a gathering 
 And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him 
 Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again? 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Hurricane 
 Accuse a Hurricane 
 Ain't change a damned shame 
 It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane 
  
 [Black Thought] 
 *overtop of sung chorus* 
 Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
 Could y'all stand the weather? 
 Could you hold it together? 
 You tell me that you know the pain 
 Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane 
 Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
 Could ya'll stand the weather? 
 You built for that weather? 
 Yo, know what'm saying? 
 Know what'm saying? 
  
 [Common] 
 You gotta fight for what you believe in 
 Nobody knows the troubles seen 
 This flick left me wondering 
 'What can become of kings and young kids?' 
 Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred 
 A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on 
 The cops, y'all know what they be on 
 A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from 
 Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight 
 Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night 
 Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising 
 Developing his knack to write 
 Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself 
 What he loved on the outside world, detached himself 
 You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system 
 He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions 
 This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White 
 A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life 
 It's amazing to a man what a book could do 
 And how certain books seem to look for you 
 This is the story of a champion's fall and rise 
 The story left me wiping my eyes 
 Peace Ru 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Hurricane 
 Accuse a Hurricane 
 Ain't change a damned shame 
 It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane 
  
 [Black Thought] 
 *overtop of sung chorus* 
 Yo, yo, forever, imagine your locked down forever 
 Could y'all stand the weather? 
 Could you hold it together? 
 You tell me that you know the pain 
 Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane 
 Forever and ever yo, locked down forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain 
 Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane 
  
 [Mos Def] 
 Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistable 
 The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?] 
 I am time 
 I scroll in measurements, control the elements 
 I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?] 
 I am time 
 I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments 
 For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?] 
 I am time 
 You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me 
 Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me 
 You can't do much for me besides serve 
 Me well and have good dividends returned to you 
 Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you 
 Many have wasted me but now they are facing me 
 Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully 
 Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be 
 Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me 
 Angel's scribe the page for me 
 Keep a full account of all the names for me 
 And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Hurricane 
 Accuse a Hurricane 
 Ain't change a damned shame 
 It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane 
  
 [Black Thought] 
 *overtop of sung chorus* 
 Yo, yo, a Hurricane forever 
 Imagine your locked down forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 Could you hold it together? 
 I can't even explain the pain 
 Imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane 
 Forever, imagine your locked down forever and ever, ever 
 Could you hold it together? 
 Yo, can't explain the pain with words, know'm saying? 
 Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane 
  
 [Dice Raw] 
 The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star 
 God placed it in a man on the day he was born 
 Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster 
 Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising 
 From out the south water, like torrential rains 
 In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed 
 You can't believe the world we live in's injust 
 All I see is more proof, there's no place for us 
 They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal 
 Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical 
 Or works by remote control 
 It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul 
 Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind 
 There's no where to run, no where to hide 
 In a six-by-six a guilty man cries 
 For repentance and lost is what innocence is 
  
 Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind 
  
 Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind 
  
 Chorus 
  
 Hurricane 
 Accuse a Hurricane 
 Ain't change a damned shame 
 It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane 
  
 [Black Thought] 
 *overtop of sung chorus* 
 Your locked down forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 Could you hold it together? 
 I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying? 
 Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane 
 Forever, imagine behind bars forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 You built for that? Is you cut for that? 
 Don't be telling me that you know the pain 
 Your life was like a hurricane, yo 
  
 Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind 
  
 Same story, same target, different time 
 Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind 
 Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind 
 Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind[Intro x6: Common] 
 Fly Love, uh uh say what 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I don't stress it baby 
 They say you got me dressing crazy 
 Eating veggies, wearing shirts extra medium 
 And if we break up, I'mma eat meat again? 
 I feel complete with you 
 Shit, I held up signs in the streets for you 
 In the streets people ask about me and you 
 I tell them "We go through what most people do" 
 Let's, let go of fear love 
 We can grow as long as my beard does 
 You push me in the way you supposed to 
 We ain't runnin' when we come close to you 
  
 [Hook: Erykah Badu, Common (Pharell Williams)] 
 -Erykah: 
 Come close to me 
 -Common: 
 Come close baby, Come Close ma (Baby) 
 Let me hold you love, come closer love 
 -Erykah: 
 Know this world gets 
 -Common: 
 It gets crazy baby, it gets girl (But) 
 -Erykah: 
 What's it without you, you, you? 
  
 [Verse 2: Pharrell Williams] 
 Eh, I know you used to watch me 
 Rock Gucci and Versace 
 But now I'm back to my skater roots 
 I still got friends in them gator boots 
 But what's up with them hater dudes 
 Ma, hating is OK with you? 
 Why? Cuz they drive in them fancy cars 
 Look, well I can ride you on my handle bars 
 On my BMX, baby 
 I'm creative with Tourette's baby 
 My testicles full of ecstasy 
 When I think about you naked, please... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge: Erykah Badu] 
 I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind 
 You're right, you're right, you're right 
 You promise so fast you just might take flight 
 Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight 
  
 [Verse 3: Q-Tip] 
 I don't stress it girl 
 They say that you and I are from different worlds 
 You're from underneath the underground 
 And I understood my Hip-Hop run to this position 
 I don't stress it sweetie 
 You write in cursive, I write in graffiti 
 Opposites, not really we just customize 
 For my turfs, hey I'm instructing you to listen 
 I'm saying that a rat's ass I couldn't give 
 Even though you're far away, in my heart you live 
 So bring your little sweet face closer to me 
 And look into my eyes tell me what you see 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Outro: All] 
 Fly love, uh uh say what[Intro: Billy Preston & Syreeta, Common] 
 (One more try) 
 (We have come too far to stop now) 
 Yeah, Dilla 
 (One more try) 
 (It is all that we have got) 
  
 [Verse 1: Common & Daniel Caesar] 
 Two DJs, one microphone 
 We freestyle, we write at home 
 It don't, it don't, uh-uh, we go on 
 You the one I can't leave alone 
 You grown? I know you grown 
 When I'm in you, I feel home 
 We in the house of love, no lie 
 Appreciate you more as time goes by 
 When it's truly true, it don't die 
 I see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y. 
 I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi 
 I hear you when JAY still make the song cry 
 Truthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense 
 You the one that gave me that confidence 
 You the one that told me 'bout consciousness 
 And said see beyond my metropolis 
 You put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this 
 We too far, ain't no stoppin' this (We're too far, now) 
  
 [Chorus: Daniel Caesar] 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you, so just be who you are 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you, so just be who you are 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Here, here, here, here, here, here we go 
 They say that, that love makes you grow 
 You've been sen-sen-sensational 
 Instrume-e-intational 
 In my life, you've been vocal 
 But at times, I felt like I didn't know you 
 Now I know you had to grow too 
 And experience life so you can know you 
 We all change, for what it's worth 
 You an angel and still down to earth 
 In many ways you like my religion 
 When no one else did, to me you listen 
 Gangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em 
 No matter, you stayed in my system 
 Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin' 
 And gettin' people out of prison 
 Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle 
 That's why we all love you 
  
 [Chorus: Daniel Caesar] 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you, so just be who you are 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you, so just be who you are 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 You gave me a voice in the world 
 It's been hard to choose another girl 
 They trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing 
 But you gave us a chance to dream 
 In young thugs, you see a future 
 You recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya 
 At 21, you knew I was savage 
 But you said, "Common, you will never be average" 
 It's a cold world, we need JAY 
 If you could dot com, you could dot K 
 You rock two chains, keep your mind free 
 You see a Malcolm X in a YG 
 You told me I'm the mane like Gucci 
 With a chance to rap and make movies 
 You gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth 
 Before me too, you said, "Ladies first" 
 Things get rocky, you there ASAP 
 Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve 
 I want you to get the love you deserve 
 My will made it on a mic' with words 
 With no name, I was a hard MC 
 Love and hip-hop, on some Cardi B 
 Now you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style 
 A future ain't odd to see 
 Free spirit, with young will like Jaden 
 When I see you, you never agin' 
 Made in America, for the world to see 
 You everybody's but you my girl to me 
 I'm forever yours, to the tic-toc 
 I'm still talking 'bout you, hip-hop 
  
 [Chorus: Daniel Caesar] 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you so just be who you are 
 Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far? 
 I, I love you so just be who you are

 I got a rhyme, you got a rhyme 
 But my rhyme is better than yours 
 (repeat 2X) 
  
 U-A-C, they get they P's and 
 No I.D., be gettin his P's and 
 The Late Show, they get they P's and 
 ProfessaNots, they get they P's and 
  
 Peep the maneuver, how bout the Heim-lich 
 I rhyme sick and you can get the duck, coon 
 I'm the shit, you're shit out of luck, tough 
 I'm the act to follow, housing kids like Ronald 
 Mac like Donald Goines, flows I change like coins 
 Choyoyoyyoyoyyng, choyoyoyyyyng, choyoyoyoyyyyyng 
 I draw a crowd like blood with the 'pint of' technique 
 And everybody there be like, "YEAH!" 
 Cause cain't near a nig dat'll say 'Whoomp, There It Is' 
 I'm like a mom on section 8, over-bearing kids 
 Shit they be like, "Com-mon!" That's my muhfucka (true) 
 Youse a hamburger, I'mma Fuddrucker 
 Askin me to let us catch up, knowin you can't cut the mustard 
 So where's the beef, jerky? 
 I'm as Worthy as James, not that good with names 
 But I do remember your face from someplace this is one taste 
 Of Chicago, we got mo' many mo' many mo' many mo' flavors 
 Don't just come to me, go ask thy neighbor-I'm-a-hood takin niggas under 
 On the tundra, cause "they're plain, they're plain" 
 I'm on a plateau that is fat so 
 It's just a fan-tasy, for the fans to see 
 How I land, I'm grand like a finale 
 I'm goin back to Cali (why?) cause Cali got bitches check it 
 Aiyyo Doc this is a sickness 
  
 Dee-da-da-da-doo-doo, dee-da-da, ah-eh-da-da 
 Dee-da-da-da-DOO-doo, dee-da-da, dee-da-da 
 South Side, rock on and 
 The West Side, we gotta rock on and 
 Hey yo Chicago, we gotta rock on and 
 The East coast, you gotta rock on and 
 The West coast, you gotta rock on and 
 Ah down South, you gotta rock on and 
 Check it... "Now you can go!" 
  
 Mister Pussy Emcee, just get on gone 
 Get on gone, you pussy MC! 
 Steppin to me, with them dirty feets you'll get defeated 
 Like Kunta Kinte, I'm kin to the Lynn crew 
 My great, great, grandpap done been through 
 So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga 
 So I figure like a father... that I'mma Turn This Mutha Out 
 But Common you ain't hittin in New York 
 I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props 
 Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep 
 Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches 
 Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag 
 I ask the bitches, "Why your titties saggin?" 
 Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses 
 I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist 
 "Ring the Alarm", I got Charm like a neck-a-lace 
 Tell the truth, tell the truth, y'all had to move your neck to this 
 Didn't you, didn't you... and it, and it, and it 
 And it don't stop, bust it 
  
 "Gotta crew ya better tell em" --> Keith Murray[Intro: Common] 
 Phone rang 
 Screen said caller ID blocked 
 But for some reason, I decided to answer it 
 On the other end, was a French accent 
 He told me we needed to rap quick 
 Cause he had did some bad shit 
 And would be gone for years 
 But spending these last two days with his momma and his kid 
 When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it 
 Cause I knew he was a real good person 
 And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit 
 He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done 
 He said now it's time for him to turn himself in 
 For no longer could he run, from life, from God 
 I started thinkin, "Why is doin' right is so hard?" 
 I thought back to when we was in London 
 Discussin' the New Testament, and how our lives related to it 
 And how we could make the best of it 
 My voice became desperate, so I asked him, "Why you gotta go?" 
 He said, "You know, turn to Matthew 24" 
 He said, "No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day 
 But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray 
 As long as God is with me, everything will be okay" 
 So right about then, we decided to pray 
  
 [Refrain: Omar Lye-Fook] 
 Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away 
 Deep into clouds (deep into clouds) 
 It's making things appear to me so clearly 
 Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds) 
 Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away 
 Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds) 
 It's making things appear to me so clearly 
 Deep into clouds (yeah) 
  
 [Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green] 
 Your time, is a terrible thing to waste! 
 For there's, not one of these possessions 
 That you can bring to space (yeah, it don't matter) 
 It's a challenge 
 But the chance of seeing it, is quite a dream to chase (yes it is) 
 I hope, I remind God of him 
 When he sees my face (yeah he will) 
 He gon' see it! 
  
 [Verse 2: Bilal] 
 Higher (keeps on) 
 This feeling just keeps on, hehe, lifting me higher (ever) 
 And it's ever flowing, it's ever flowing (keeps on) 
 When everything, puts a smile on my face 
 (Ever flowing, ever flowing) 
 And I recognize this strong goal 
 But I keeps on going 
 I keep on going (he keeps on going) 
 I keep on going on, ohh 
 (He keeps on going, he keeps on) 
 (He keeps on going) 
 (He keeps on going, he keeps on going) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jill Scott] 
 All mighty love, watching over me 
 A smile, brilliant 
 All over, constantly 
 Warm, comforting (comforting) 
 Perfect, like, no-thing 
 No haze, no confusion, no strain 
 Simply, peace 
 Simply, simply, simply, simply 
  
 [Verse 4: Mary J. Blige] 
 No fear! Heaven is to me 
 No fear of destruction, oh oh oh oh 
 Understanding who he is 
 His name is Christ, yeah (oh oh oh oh) 
 Heaven, Heaven is to me 
 Wisdom, understanding, knowledge 
 Oh (understanding) 
  
 [Verse 5: Erykah Badu] 
 Streets of gold and pearly gates 
 Halos wings all dressed in white 
 Hah (hah) hah (hah) 
 Angels sing and cymbols glare 
 No one's rich, no one's poor 
 Hah (hah) hah (hah) 
 People dreaming they live free 
 Making love while they in love 
 Hah (hah) hah (hah) 
 Wonderful dream 
 Wake me when you're home 
 Hah (hah) hah (hah) 
  
 [Outro: Lonnie 'Pops' Lynn] 
 Heaven? Heaven is being Pops 
 Heaven is spending a day with the grandchildren 
 Listening to they voices, and laughter and play 
 And then at the end of the day 
 We hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away 
 And then suddenly, they turn and rush back to me 
 And hug me around the knees 
 Yeah, that's Heaven to me[Verse 1: Common] 
 Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle 
 The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in 
 I knew inside when I was outside on the south side 
 Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried 
 Oh that's my stepfather 
 He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors 
 For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose 
 Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros 
 Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed 
 To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me 
 Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali 
 A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000 
 Telling me what I can't be 
 But you can't paint me 
 Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics 
 And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good 
 And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club 
 Still I love 
  
 [Hook: Syd Tha Kyd] 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9 
 The toughest in Cook County 
 They count me out cause I did a crime 
 They say it's violent time in human beings 
 But being they ain't seeing me as human 
 In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming 
 Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me 
 Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones 
 I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones 
 My pops, y'all built and destroyed him 
 With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment 
 When will we see enjoyment? 
 I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes 
 But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together 
 What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out 
 Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out 
 My life story is written in a prison sentence 
 Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness? 
 Still I love 
  
 [Hook: Syd Tha Kyd] 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
  
 [Outro: Bilal] 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I, it's the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I, it's the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free, make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I, it's the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free, make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I, it's the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah[Intro x3: Common] 
 I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby 
  
 [Hook: Common] 
 Everybody, I'd like to announce 
 Throw your hands up when we in the house 
 Yeah, this is hip hop, baby 
 I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby 
 And tell your girl that the tickets is out 
 And we gonna do this 'til they kickin' us out 
 Cause, this is hip hop, baby 
 I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Live from the south side, this one, hide your gun 
 Representing Chi Town to the fullest, raps are bullets 
 See them rappers? They be duckin' 
 When Comm be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin' 
 On the sink, got my momma a mink 
 Think Common is the link 
 Thought the game was extinct 
 Lady, them jeans is as slim as Shady 
 Brought them back from the 80's 
 Now, let's make some babies 
 Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me 
 Now we can push more whips than slavery 
 Alex Haley of this rap shit, my roots is deep 
 You heard the bitch in you, yeah I know what's beef 
 Let it cook and I pop like grease 
 You thirsty niggas can't shock my feast, ugh 
 I still love her, she be needin' the dick 
 When it comes to hip-hop, it's just me and my bitch 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Pharrell] 
 Baby, you're like, "What the-- fuck? There is no other" 
 Valet crashed my Rolls so quickly I bought another 
 Sorry, Mr. Williams moved out the building 
 Spot to the top, 50 feet was the ceiling 
 (Slow down, son, you're killin' 'em) Well funded it was not gangsta 
 Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills 
 When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie 
 The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove through his city 
 Now, all the little bitties, from ugly to pretty 
 I was the magician, mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen 
 My dick is like a blow-pop baby 
 And it get stiffer than some Botox baby 
 But show out baby, and show me you gon' act right 
 And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike 
 She don't know the Casio cost a hundred 
 It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it 
 What? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back 
 Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac 
 I probably go to jail but naw, that ain't me 
 I style crazy and net like Jay Z 
 The black Kojak "I get money" and want more stacks 
 The rap photographer, the way the flow snap 
 Broads say, "Are you a philosopher?" 
 Yea yea, I'll philosophize on top of ya 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 Cold-blooded, cold-blooded, hard-core 
 Rough and rugged, rugged and raw 
 For you and your-your, for you and your 
 You got the C to the, huh - cold-blooded 
 Ain't it - huh, c'mon - hard-core 
 We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er 
 Yo, yo 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My little daughter, started, nursery school 
 Brother Com, gotta make our move through 
 The stylist and violence with vibrance 
 The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless 
 The mind is a terrible thing to spill 
 Rap life's like a dream that seems for real 
 A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres 
 After travellin the world to see paper's just paper 
 Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker 
 I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off 
 I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off 
 D be like, "We ain't got no time for that!" 
 ?uestlove said, "We ain't got no time for that!" 
 My old bird like, "We ain't got no time for that!" 
 So I rhyme when my back hurts 
 Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk 
 I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin 
 We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's 
 Beast for each and greet the meek with speech 
 To seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep 
 I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out 
 At night, when most cats pull the gun out 
 Go on and on and, to the break of when the 
 Sound run out, run out, r-run out 
 C uhh, yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cold-blooded (c'mon) cold-blooded, hard-core 
 (hit em with the) Rough and rugged (c'mon) rugged and raw 
 (hey) for you and yours, for you and yours 
 You got the C, uhh - cold-blooded (yeah) 
 Cold-blooded (c'mon) hard-core 
 (ain't it funky) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw 
 For you and yours, for you and yours 
 (Yo, yo I-I think I wanna taste these horns 
 I want you to taste these horns, c'mon now) 
 C, the cold-blooded (uh) cold-blooded (yeah) hard-core 
 (ain't it) Rough and rugged (uh) rugged and raw

 C'mon, give em, give us a little more) 
 For you and yours, for you and yours 
 C to the, cold-blooded (na, na-nasty) cold-blooded, hard-core 
 (c'mon) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw 
 (Yo, aight let let me get a little taste of this here) 
 For you and yours, for you and yours 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh 
 These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh 
 As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign 
 On the industry I came 
 With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk 
 My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk 
 Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga 
 I'm killin 'em soft 
 Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course 
 I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source 
 Can't explain why the force, is with me 
 Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney 
 Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks 
 Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract 
 I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene 
 With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds 
 Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter 
 The way you want the game I rub off like henna 
 I remain like a tattoo with natural raps 
 Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts 
 Battle raps is where it began, I'mma end it wherever I land 
 I done thought of, a master plan, it goes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cold-blooded (c'mon) cold-blooded, hard-core 
 (hit em with the) Rough and rugged (c'mon) rugged and raw 
 (hey) for you and yours, for you and yours 
 You got the C, uhh - cold-blooded (yeah) 
 Cold-blooded (c'mon) hard-core 
 (ain't it funky) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw 
 For you and yours, for you and yours 
 (Yo, yo I-I think I wanna taste these horns 
 I want you to taste these horns, c'mon now) 
 C, the cold-blooded (uh) cold-blooded (yeah) hard-core 
 (ain't it) Rough and rugged (uh) rugged and raw 
 (yeah baby that's what I'm talkin about 
 C'mon, give em, give us a little more) 
 For you and yours, for you and yours 
 C to the, cold-blooded (na, na-nasty) cold-blooded, hard-core 
 (c'mon) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw 
 (Yo, aight let let me get a little taste of this here) 
 For you and yours, for you and yours[Intro] 
 Gotta watch out for them critters... 
  
 I get the party live, Common Sense'll get the party live, huh (4X) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I was born in Chicago, raised on Planet Rock, talking zuh zuh zuh zuh 
 Cats knock my tape like boots, I'm as fresh as fruits 
 You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke 
 Repent! You burn up, you got me bent 
 I'm current as an event, got on big hoes at Freaknik 
 Frequently you're telling me Whoopty Woo can rock it 
 So? He ain't put no scratch in my pocket 
 Yo herb, with my hand I cock it 
 And rock it like that brother in Colors, 'cause I want y'all to live 
 My crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear 
 But I can't get us all in free (What?) 
 It's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee 
 I rock the same clothes 3 days straight 
 To you they wrinkled but to me they straight 
 Now I'm straight; are you straight? 
 I'm straight as long as I got beer 
 I thought about it, Jack, and now I'm outta here 
  
 [Hook] 
 ("Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock") (8X in background) 
 I get the party live, Common Sense get the party live 
 I get the party live, Common Sense get the party live 
 We get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live 
 I get the party live, Common Sense get the party live 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I need me some new socks (uhh), I need me some new drawers 
 I draws attention, like a letter to a sergeant 
 There's a few good emcees, the wack I'm giving code red 
 Slim say I ain't got no body, but when they see me at the party 
 They be like "Go 'head, go 'head" 
 'Cause I got's the cuts like Bobbitt, rappers are dickheads 
 Shoppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red 
 My office hours are from 9 to 5 
 While you avoid the party I make it live 
 The fellas nod and the chicks dance 
 While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants 
 I'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks 
 I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back 
 Nowadays blacks don't know how to act 
 Besides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton, and Wesley Snipes 
 Marks wanna test me because I test the mics 
 But I check 'em like sound, and like Goose, I'm down 
 Plus I done got better since "Soul By the Pound"; I'm maintaining 
  
 [Hook] 
 ("Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock") (8X in background) 
 We get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live 
 We get the party live, 87 get the party live 
 I get the party live, Common Sense get the party live 
 We get the party live, UAC'll get the party live 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I fall fresh upon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelmin' 
 And house more hoes than Spelman 
 Words I'm weldin' like James Johnson 
 My brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson 
 Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court 
 But I could never be bought 
 What type of rebel eats pork? 
 I'll take the cat and never get caught 
 U-AC together we fought 
 'Cause I can't see my mellows boxin' and me not boxin' wit' 'em 
 I don't care who started it, I'mma be a part of it 
 Regardless of the odds of how hard 
 It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with 'em 
 I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes 
 But a 5 becomes a 10 when a brother's off some gin 
 I got juice, and this nigga scared 
 I'll F your head up, like the LA Four 
 When I flow like cash I go for broke like Melba Moore 
 Why should a male with a B.A. get more than me? 
 When Rashid got an MC degree 
 And a doctorate in rockin' shit, I go to Dock's to get 
 A fishwich with cheese 
 I don't mix with MCs, 'cause I just don't like them mother... 
 But I'm still maintaining 
  
 [Hook] 
 ("Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock") (8X in background) 
 We get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live, yeah 
 We get the party live, 87 get the party live, yeah 
 I get the party live, Common Sense get the party live, huh 
 We get the party live, UAC'll get the party live[Common] 
 Yeah, yeah, what, yeah 
 Reminding me of Sef, what? 
 Fat fat thick booty, what? 
 You say jack that big booty, yo 
 He say OOH OH 
 I heard the boy he said OOH OH 
 The party people he said OOH OH 
 Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo 
 Check it, check it 
  
 Driftin on a memory, brought forth 
 From a fifth of Hennesey, as in times 
 Of eighty-nine they envision me 
 Warm days and the cold beer chemistry 
 Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such 
 Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct 
 High school I came out it 
 Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted 
 Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit 
 My niggas be fuckin girls that she hang out with 
 Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love' 
 Arguin over if he said, "Dumb bitch" 
 Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist 
 Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit 
 Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot 
 Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box 
 That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped 
  
 Chorus: Chantay Savage 
  
 It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh 
 It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh 
  
 [Common] 
 Check it 
 Before these minds got ahold to some drugs 
 And start thinkin they thugs 
 We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club 
 Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free 
 Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin 
 Saved my day, dancin on speakers 
 Flames snatched I was born this way 
 87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin 
 Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin 
 Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models 
 And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas 
 Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD 
 I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke 
 Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny 
 It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji 
 Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew 
 Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to 
 Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the Taste 
 Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake 
 House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up 
 At em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up 
  
 Chorus 
  
 [Common] 
 There go the break 
 To get the break go, it go OOH OH 
 Yeah, it go OOH OH 
 You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
 Yo, check it, check it 
  
 Nowadays niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place 
 I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace 
 At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place 
 Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace 
 Remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace 
 Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes 
 Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother 
 If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other 
 Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts 
 We'd eat, at Giordano's and break out 
 Then everybody thought that they could spend 
 High rollers had the MCM blazer blend 
 Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in 
 Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in 
 Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T 
 Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be 
 It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill 
 My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still 
  
 Chorus[Scratched] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Intro] 
 Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street 
 South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it 
 It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down 
 Common Sense is in your town 
 I said come on, y'all, get live, get down 
 Common Sense is in your town 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin' 
 Over the global, my vocals be travellin' 
 Unravellin' my abdomen, it's slime that's babblin' 
 Grammatics that are masculine 
 I grab them in, verbally badgerin' broads 
 I wish that Madelyne, was back on Video LP 
 Raps I make up like blacks do excuses 
 I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces 
 If a broad ain't got a mind, a job or crib, she useless 
 Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines 
 They say signs of the end is near 
 I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin' a beer 
 Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager 
 Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear, I'm the flavor 
 My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise 
 Don't watch the Bulls as much (Why?) 
 They got too many white boys 
 A million black men walkin' towards one direction 
 For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection 
  
 [Scratched] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 A prophet, raised among Black Disciples and Vice Lords 
 Who don't give a fuck about mic cords 
 At night, swords get up, together black wrists get cuffed 
 I'm wishin' for a change but my man want his change in a cup 
 Yes Sir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot 
 Bitches put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they ass 
 I rule everything around me like cash 
 On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed 
 In jams, I mash like Alan Alda 
 Niggas nod, thangs say "Hey" as if I was Little Walter 
 87 strip walker, taught the code of the area 
 By stayin', within the barrier 
 Exposed to Stony stimuli, with that I identify 
 Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness 
 Skull caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on 
 Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron 
  
 [Scratched] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Interlude] 
 1, 2, 1, 2, we'll get on down, check it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike 
 When in dim light, I use insight to enlight 
 Then write somethin' that's skin tight 
 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe 
 Imagination's in flight, I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright 
 Get open like on gym nights and in fights, I send rights 
 Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes 
 I've been indicted as a freak of all trades 
 Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo, I got it made 
 I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums 
 Come from a tribe of bums, hooked on Negro and mums 
 Had to halt with the, malt liquor 
 'Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas 
 Now my speech and thoughts quicker 
 Cruisin' South Side streets with no heat and no sticker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 87 got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 Chicago got my back and we don't... now check it 
 I'm a ho but not a ho nigga 
 Ain't scared of no nigga 
 When it's my turn to go I gotta go 
 And I'm gone with the storm 
  
 [Scratched] 
 "Resurrection"[Intro] 
 Littlefinger: The realm, do you know what the realm is? 
 It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies 
 A story we agreed to tell each other over and over 
 'Til we forget that it's a lie 
 Varys: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? 
 Chaos, a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all 
 Littlefinger: Chaos isn't a pit, chaos is a ladder 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The rain came upon us, we played the corners 
 Like Richard Sherman the best, I'm still learning 
 Scriptures turn to pages, pictures burn in rages 
 Outrageous, the big world, the stage is set 
 Threats coming from different ages 
 Death is ageless, life is dangerous 
 Change is the only thing guaranteed 
 I ain't afraid of the opps cause I know they bleed just like us 
 In the Seven Kingdoms ain't nobody righteous 
 A massacre at the Red Wedding, the lifeless 
 Laid on the ground, now who wears the crown? 
 A rope tied around by the power we bound 
 Sound the trumpets, I got soldiers by the hundreds 
 We all want it with our eyes on the summit 
 Chaos is a ladder and some fall from it 
 Some get tall from it, high like they all blunted 
 But this the year that we doing it with no fears 
 God in both ears saying ''be sincere'' 
 Some are laughing, some of 'em be in tears 
 If this the end let the games begin 
  
 [Hook] 
 I think about it when I'm in my zone 
 This life is like a game of thrones 
 I sit and think when I'm in my zone 
 This life is like a game of thrones[Intro: Common] 
 Yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks 
 I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek 
 I seekin' it with 'em 
 I'm dope, the streets need me to hit 'em 
 With some of that (revolutionary rap) revolutionary blunted rap 
 My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back 
 Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes 
 My guys pack heat, enough to bury June 
 On my feet, I'm getting married soon 
 Walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune 
 The fumes of a real nigga seep into your room 
 Or through fifthteens of the Jeep that you boom 
 Son so many cats, they call me high noon 
 Offerings to Oshun, hoping war is over soon 
 Guard your grill like George Foreman 
 Time to build, as far as building, I'm the doorman 
 Opening doors, my blood I expose on the floors 
 Tell them the game ain't only the score 
 Hold on to your life as I carry these styles 
 To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles 
 You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line 
 In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed 
 Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds 
 Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine 
 In the age of Aquarius 
  
 [Hook: Bilal & Erykah Badu] 
 The water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 To purify the world (do-ba ba ba) 
 Flying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 So watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba) 
 Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks 
 With raps, all over your head like Tweet 
 Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth 
 Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt 
 Same spot where it's joyous where the pain is felt 
 As you build and destroy, yo remain yourself 
 They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams 
 And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme 
 Or the struggle of fiends 
 I flow over water that's as troubled as teens 
 For the love of the team, trying to double the dream 
 Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings 
 I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones 
 Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems 
 While you and your dogs foam at the mouth 
 Thinking rap is the only way out 
 The black human genius will never play out 
 I take you way out, where you never been before 
 Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Earth 
 That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse 
 I deaded your shit before you finished a verse 
 From niggas to gods from bitches to earths 
 From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse 
 Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse 
 Holla back, but listen first 
 We in the age of Aquarius 
  
 [Hook: Bilal & Erykah Badu] 
 The water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 To purify the world (do-ba ba ba) 
 Flying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 So watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba) 
 Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius) 
 The water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 To purify the world (do-ba ba ba) 
 Flying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba) 
 So watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba) 
 Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius) 
  
 [Outro: Bilal & Erykah Badu] 
 Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius) 
 Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)[Verse 1: Common] 
 Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces 
 Plastic bag carryin', no two paces 
 IPhone, belt by Gucci 
 Bands with loose change and some car keys 
 To the Maserati, license plate read "God Body" 
 Passenger side only ride hot bodies 
 When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies 
 Cadillac come from the Southside army 
 The army now, don't try to harm me now 
 It's my time, you can't alarm me now 
 I ball, bitches wanna palm me now 
 Vacation in palm tree style 
 In the morning where the dons be now 
 Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with a Ashe 
 Cops say we lookin' for a nigga thats dressed nice 
 Seats be goin' way back like Just Ice 
 Black leather wearin' "justice" on the collar 
 Change is we only ain't trustin' the dollars 
 Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets 
 Probably with technique, and let the Tec speak 
 Like the led conference I rap off the head conscious 
 Freestyle, free trap niggas from bondage 
 Every word you heard is bond is 
 Double-0 87, on some Bond shit 
 I'm out on bond 
  
 [Hook] 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
  
 [Verse 2: Vince Staples] 
 Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces 
 Los Padrinos to juvenile placement 
 Known for C-notes, the feds confiscatin' 
 Back to that block with brains on the pavement 
 Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter 
 Cause they did it, you was influenced 
 Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger 
 Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer 
 Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver 
 That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin' 
 Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later 
 'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff 
 Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes 
 I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me 
 While I'm out on bond tryin' to buy my time 
 'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range[Verse 1] 
 Uhh, uhh 
 Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N 
 Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem 
 Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them 
 Cold as the winter when fake niggas was shiverin' 
 Shakin' in they Timberlands, you as played as Bennigans 
 Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him" 
 I been a master since P was No Limitin 
 Stick to sayin' 
 No gimmickin' and no mimickin' 
 Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin in 
 Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them 
 Pelican brief these niggas on who I be 
 Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid 
 Noble like Drew Ali 
 Many have come 
 But few have been chose to be a true MC 
 You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack 
 Young who? Oh, he the openin' act 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go 
 It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop 
 Pop your bottles 
 Chicago niggas do it in staccato 
 Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto 
 And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model 
 Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle 
 Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local 
 Rappin' over vocals 
 Soundin' soft as JoJo 
 With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla 
 You was better as a drug dealer 
 Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale 
 Half of it is what you say and half is style 
 I guess it's time for you to start cashin' out 
 It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down 
 Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest 
 Performances keep me stackin' the sheets 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The name is Com I’m like a rebel in rap 
 Struggle music mixed with weed to make the ghetto react 
 I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back 
 They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap 
 I guess it’s Kramer and Bush that don’t care about blacks 
 Kinda wish it was some real niggas there that just snapped 
 Meanwhile in the mean world, hoes cry freedom and fiends url 
 I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls 
 And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson 
 The law get outta pocket then I’ma be buckin’ 
 Goin’ against me joe is self-destruction 
 I’m tired of y'all like my man is of hustlin’ 
 Shuckin’ and jivin', gon’ do that dance nigga 
 30 with kids pull up ya pants nigga 
 I ran with the brothers from around the 7 
 I can tell who’s live by soundcheckin'[Verse 1] 
 Whatup BITCH? I'm Petey Wheatstraw 
 And you don't stop, with the heidi heidi ho 
 Hi ho, or bye ho, if you're lookin for a sucker 
 (What are you?) I'm just another motherfucker 
 Pucker your lips, do flips like Mary Lou 
 Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'mma marry you 
 Bury you, I will do, after, I bill you 
 Kill you, ho, cause your shit smells like mildew 
 Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag 
 Or better yet Black, Flag, you scallywag 
 Tag, I didn't mean to diss dis... ho butt 
 But you need to stay such, do not touch 
 Much disrespect goes out to you 
 And your parents, too, for having you 
 Haven't you been introduced to a douche? 
 I guess you said fuck footloose, and got your pussy loose 
 No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a 
 Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up 
 For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off 
 And have more use, than a public park 
 For recreation, giving up the body is a hobby 
 I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it) 
 Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas 
 Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Heidi Heidi Ho, huh, the Heidi Ho 
 All the niggas know, yo the Heidi Ho, c'mon 
 The Heidi Ho, hah the Heidi Ho 
 All the niggas know, that you're a Heidi Ho 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (Now bring it back brotha) 
 Eni-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-miney-moe 
 Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger 
 You can catch a ho, there's your ho, kiss a ho, fuck a ho 
 Diss a ho, I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago 
 Hablo ingles? I don't know espanol Joe 
 I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo 
 Homo's a nono, so faggots, stay solo 
 I roll my dick so it holds just like a Rolo 
 Total recall, yeah I see y'all 
 I see you, I see you're a freak too, so peek a boo 
 I'm prickin you whether or not, took you out that's work see 
 So get your skirt see, and bitch, dirty 
 Curtsey, dosey-do out the do' slut 
 This is what I come on, so slut you better grow up 
 Slow up, you forgot your earrings here take em 
 Salami beef and ham with the asalaam alaikum 
 Like that ho (that ho) that ho (that ho) 
 Dabba-da-dat, it's like that ho 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Heidi Heidi Ho, huh, the Heidi Ho 
 All the niggas know, yo the Heidi Ho, c'mon 
 The Heidi Ho, hah the Heidi Ho 
 All the niggas know, that you're a Heidi Ho 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sittin on the dock of the bay, I say ho 
 Say ho?! (Ho!!) Do you know, do you know? 
 Bo knows this ho blows much much dick 
 An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic 
 Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat 
 C'mere k-k-k-k-k-k, yo c'mere you little puddy cat 
 What, your booty black is so indespicable 
 You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin jiggaboo 
 You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here 
 But first get curlin iron burns off your forehead 
 My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl 
 You're fuckin everybody around the way, and been all around the world 
 And you still can't find yo' fate 
 But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady 
 The lady is a tramp snake ho yo and all of that 
 Fuck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back

 There's a party in your mouth BITCH, and everybody's comin

 But you just wanna rock me, oooh, check it 
 So get your rattle rattle thunder clatter boom boom boom 
 Because I gotta gotta get some, el-bow, room 
 So I can Bang-kok, better yet, knock Italy 
 But raindrops keep fallin on my couch, try to sit with me 
 Tamperin up my program, so I play another slow jam 
 It's not an ancient Chinese secret, you should know man 
 But you insist on stay and playin Genesis 
 I gotta put an end to this, balderdash, EEE haul ass 
 And don't come knockin my door, with the cockle-doodle-doo

 To the break y'all (break y'all break, BREAK!) 
  
 The CB's, the CB's, they'rrrrre here! 
 I'm checkin my mirror from the rear, blocks are closer than they appear 
 The time is near for you to drop your beer and get your nuts again 
 But ain't no haps (UH-UH) your dick isn't there 
 You're thinkin that, "Oops, I made a mistake" 
 You say, "Fuck Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break" 
 You made a mistake on the first take 
 Tryin to break a leg for take two 
 You shoulda ate your Wheaties 
 And Petey mighta made a breakthrough 
 You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position 
 Wishin he would listen, so you start to kissin 
 It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline 
 You aimed, you fired, THERE YOU GO, limp figures 
 So you take ? and then play the role of friend and talk 
 Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk 
 Baby Bubba you's a goner, ahh, you's a goner 
 It's fucked up, when Your Dick Is Playin Tricks On Ya 
 So you pop fizz, what a relief, beef strokin'-off 
 My man, got your thing, in your hand, say, "I I think I can!" 
 Damn this never happened before, yeah sure that's what they all say 
 Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is salty 
 What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted 
 It's a pile of pew, pick up your glove and say, "Yo I got it!" 
 Hopin you won't drop you thought you had it made like ?Kay? 
 What more could go wrong - you got the right one baby! 
 Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows 
 That you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's

 Break it up, break it up, break it up, BREAK DOWN! 
  
 Walkin up and then down the strip 
 Lookin for some hip so I can skip 
 I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script 
 That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus 
 So I'm gettin a bus, as I thrill at the disgust 
 Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
 And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business 
 Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits 
 And blew a kiss to her 
 (THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her 
 I hooked up with the one that looked NICE 
 Took her mind, like an ICE 
 'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice 
 Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill 
 They told her to keep that booty still 
 I been through more hoes than the pill 
 Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH) 
 In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK) 
 The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin knocked 
 I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop 
 So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell 
 Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail 
 Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
 Like a belt, everything was strapped 
 'til my homey asked, "WASSUP WIT DAT?" 
 The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy 
 This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy 
 THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end 
 The little red Corvette that locked the door and I can't get in 
 No more no more no more and now I know and now I know 
 Don't mess around with CB's, good buddie, ten-fo' 
  
 (Ha hahh, yeahh, ahh break it..)[Verse 1: Common] 
 She seen pain in my eye 
 Men and women at work, cranes in the sky 
 We gon' keep building for our children's children 
 Doctors keep pilling, love is a drug then drugs can't heal 'em 
 But listen to Lauryn for the healing, peeling back layers 
 Pops used to hoop, I'm from a bloodline of players 
 Love and sunshine like Roy Ayers 
 Put your mind on the phone, I ain't coming back home 
 I felt the death of what it is to be alone 
 Everlasting love, money can't buy 
 Can't hide from the truth even when I pop the lock 
 Can't work it away, can't drink it away 
 Can't laugh it away, can't think it away 
 That pain come up on you like a thief in the day 
 Searching for the sun, I found my Issa Rae 
 Insecurity cold, imperial robes 
 I used to wear my heart open like Ethereal Rose 
 Now I'm carrying loads of baggage I don't claim 
 If she start tripping I'm hopping on the plane 
 Cranes in the sky, I know how the metal sound 
 I never settled in life so it's hard to settle down 
 Staying on my square trying not to get around 
 Hold my lady hostile, she could rebel down 
 Don't touch my hair, I'm baldheaded 
 Kept my love locked down like it was all dreaded 
 Wishing for wings again so I could spread it 
 But now it's in a plastic cup of false beverage 
  
 [Verse 2: Solange] 
 I tried to drink it away 
 I tried to put one in the air 
 I tried to dance it away 
 I tried to change it with my hair 
  
 [Verse 3: Solange] 
 I ran my credit card bill up 
 Thought a new dress would make it better 
 I tried to work it away 
 But that just made me even sadder 
  
 [Verse 4: Solange] 
 I tried to keep myself busy 
 I ran around in circles 
 Think I made myself dizzy 
 I slept it away, I sexed it away 
 I read it away 
 Away 
  
 [Refrain 1: Solange] 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
  
 [Hook 1: Solange] 
 Well it's like cranes in the sky 
 Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds 
 Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky 
 Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds 
  
 [Verse 5: Solange] 
 I tried to run it away 
 Thought then my head be feeling clearer 
 I traveled 70 states 
 Thought moving round make me feel better 
  
 [Verse 6: Solange] 
 I tried to let go my lover 
 Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover 
 To write it away or cry it away 
 Don't you cry baby 
 Away 
  
 [Refrain 1: Solange] 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
  
 [Hook 2: Solange] 
 But it's like cranes in the sky 
 Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds 
 Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky 
 Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal... 
  
 [Refrain 2: Solange] 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away 
 Away, away, away, away, away[Intro: James Fauntleroy + Common] 
 Is the sun in your eyes? 
 It's me again, No I.D. again, yeah, uh... 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Black heat on the streets of desire 
 Some got rich and some got priors 
 My dogs hop barbed wires and steal cars with pliers 
 Wanna see more and be more like the wire 
 Live Via-Com from the city of Chi 
 But it's never quiet, huh 
 This is the noise of suppliers and buyers 
 Gangbangers that should've retired, food from deep fryers 
 I'm getting high thinking how to reach higher 
 Bald but these broads is my Delilah 
 Samsung pictures, more spit scriptures 
 Shorties hold liquor, flows get richer 
 It gets thick like my bro's little sister 
 Hormones got 'em thicker quicker 
 Pure souls that become boa constrictors 
 Mixed up like elixirs, trigger happy in the midst of 
 Summer madness 
  
 [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] 
 Is the sun in your eyes? 
 'Cause you're missing all the sights 
 But it's gonna be alright 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 It's summertime, niggas bring the heat out 
 Gun talk is how summer start to speak out 
 Shorties bear arms 'cause don't nobody reach out 
 Young frames leak out, aunties freak out 
 The front porch is sorta like the beach house 
 Niggas running bases with their cleats out 
 Every week now I'm getting texts about death 
 Leaving me out of breath 
 I gotta step to the stairway to heaven, it started on 87 
 Barack was playing sermons riding Reverend Clay Evans 
 I never really took it in like them youngsters 
 It's how I looked at them, maybe I should look again 
 'Cause death and prison sentences ain't how their book should end 
 When you go outside you still gotta look within 
 You can't scare 'em straight 'cause they keep a crooked grin 
 I hate to say it's fate, look at what could've been 
 It's summer madness 
  
 [Outro: Common + James Fauntleroy] 
 Summertime got you blind 
 I prefer your goddamn mind 
 Yeah, it's summer madness 
 But it's gonna be alright 
 It goes on in Chitown, yeah 
 It's gonna be alright 
 It goes on in Detroit, ATL 
 It's gonna be alright 
 To my peoples up in Brooklyn true, yeah 
 But it's gonna be alright 
 Out there in New York, Queens, Harlem 
 My West Coast people out in L.A., yeah 
 All the way to Alabama, you know, up there to Seattle 
 You know you got hoods all over[Verse 1: Gucci Mane] 
 Come look into the eyes of a man named Gucci (Uh) 
 Got me peepin' out the blinds like Malcolm with the Uzi (Yea) 
 The government, the church, and the world is so polluted 
 They callin' me a criminal when I'm a revolution (Huh) 
 Woke up in a prison cell and I had a revelation 
 That my life's a testimony, I could be an inspiration (Yea) 
 From the 6 to the Chi, got so much in common 
 Gucci Mane and Common, did you see this comin'? (Go) 
 Nigga with an attitude, a hundred miles and runnin' 
 I done did some things so dirty that I wish I never done it (Wow) 
 All eyes on me, America's most wanted 
 It's so hard to be a Black man in a white man country (No) 
 Product of the slums with rich white folks' money (Yea) 
 And the police got no love for me, but I'm not scared of nothin' (No) 
 Mass incarcerate us, man and then they call it "justice" (Wha) 
 "Gucci how you feel?" I'm so tired of the fuck shit (Wop) 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 Look me in my face, If you wanna know, yeah, yeah 
 I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go 
 Black America, yeah 
 Black America 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The Black diaspora 
 Supreme math into the after 
 Life, I live it for the master 
 Truck drivers passed us 
 Like Jeremiah and Jasper 
 Children of Zimbabwe and Madagascar 
 Africa unite, we on the move like runaway slaves through the night 
 I write, "Freedom ain't far" 
 My North Star's more than a sports car 
 Taught by the ancestors who fought for our 
 Liberation army 
 Islam palmed me and calmed me 
 So the world couldn't blond me 
 Lectures by Kwame Ture 
 The ambiance of pan-Africanism 
 A man after wisdom of the ancients 
 I paint with words like the brushes of Kehinde Wiley 
 Black and proud, we wild 
 We wowed the world with Black magnificence 
 A symphony for the divine 
 And we the instruments, Black innocence 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 Look me in my face, If you wanna know 
 I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go 
 Black America, yeah 
 Black America 
  
 [Verse 3: Pusha T] 
 I confess, I've been part of the problem 
 As of lately, I'm tryin' to solve 'em 
 I sold dope and I still talk the jargon 
 Just like Malcolm 'fore the X was on him 
 All these years later, we still the target 
 Look at Ferguson, Brooklyn and Charlotte 
 Sellin' CDs, reachin' for wallets 
 Trayvon'd be in his last year of college 
 I still mourn for Christopher Wallace 
 What happened in Dallas does not give me solace 
 So I acknowledge my flaws, apolige 
 Hey young world, just givin' you the knowledge 
 The knowledge 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 Look me in my face, If you wanna know 
 I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go 
 Black America, yeah 
 Black America 
  
 [Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 I'll take you there, To get in, oh 
 Black America 
 Look me in my face, If you wanna know 
 I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go 
 Black America Black America 
 Black America Black America 
 Black America, Black America 
 Black America[Pre-Hook: Pharrell & Common] 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing 
 Nothing you could do (straight up) 
 There's nothing you could do (you know the boy is serious) 
 There's nothing you could do 
 I don't even know why you wanna play with it 
 There's nothing you could do 
  
 [Hook: Common] 
 They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game 
 A heart full of glory and a fist of pain 
 A couple of battle scars but shit's the same 
 Are you not entertained? 
 So all the onlookers and the bystanders 
 Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras 
 Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum 
 And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium 
 The gladiator 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I was told by a wise old to come from the heart 
 Though I might've did "The Light", I don't run from the dark 
 The dark knight to spark mics and start fights 
 The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice 
 It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared? 
 A beast amongst boys, like Paul I'm revered 
 Vroof, vroof-vroof vroof-vroof-vroof, well 
 Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele 
 You frail on the mic like you might break a nail 
 I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L 
 I knew a fat broad that broke the scale 
 Still touched down cause I was off Martell 
 Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail 
 Took the underground rail to the NFL 
 I rebel in YSL 
 Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandel' 
  
 [Pre-Hook: Pharrell & Common] 
 There's nothing you could do 
 Man, why you wanna go against me? 
 There's nothing you could do (you've seen where I'm from) 
 There's nothing you could do (you've seen what I do) 
 There's nothing you could do

 Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum 
 And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium 
 The gladiator 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 My words is the sword, my skill is the shield 
 My life is the style, I stay dressed to kill 
 A legend like Will, Smith with the steel 
 I could save the world when shit get for real 
 The skinny George Foreman, all in your grill 
 My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel 
 Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel 
 The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will 
 My drive (VROOM!) is how I stay the livest 
 Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid 
 Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids 
 You easy to take out cause you hot garbage 
 I'm amped like wattage—the truth, nigga, honest 
 Any moment opponents drop out like college 
 Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust 
 Stadium, hands in the air, fists balled up 
  
 [Hook: Pharrell & Common] 
 There's nothing you could do (you know what it is) 
 There's nothing you could do (the boy is raw) 
 There's nothing you could do (so who next?) 
 There's nothing you could do

 And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium 
 The gladiator 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt 
 Scars over bars, symbols of the work 
 Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama 
 Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta 
 So don't violate or you'll get violated 
 Some of you model bitches is so overrated 
 Don't mean to underrate it but damn it, I made it 
 In the water I waded, on the corner I painted 
 Draw blood like we related 
 MCs get de-decapitated 
 Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with 
 Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick 
 Then light shit, up like a dread with the herbs 
 Get sex in the city and head in the burbs 
 These are the words of a radical 
 The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud 
 To be the gladiator 
  
 [Pre-Hook: Pharrell & Common] 
 There's nothing you could do 
 How could you even question this? 
 There's nothing you could do 
 There's nothing you could do (now you know) 
 There's nothing you could do (the future)

 [Erykah Badu] 
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side.. 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare 
 You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most 
 They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. 
 .. to the most, high 
 Regardless of what happen on him let's rely 
  
 (Chorus) 
  
 Yo, yo, check it 
 It's important, we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write 
 For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall 
 For better or worse times, I hope to me you call 
 So I pray everyday more than anything 
 Friends will stay as we begin to lay 
 This foundation for a family - love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually 
 Granted we known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 (Chorus) 
  
 Yeah.. yo, yo, check it 
 It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh 
 Suggestin beats I should rhyme to 
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good 
 I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal 
 It's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'mma lead you 
 And whatever's right, I'mma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace 
  
 (Chorus)[Verse 1: Common] 
 She rested her head upon my chest 
 Sensed liberation in between breaths 
 Wonder if sex is what she found it in 
 Peace, found it laying down with men 
 Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her 
 It was more than bodies we shared with each other 
 We layed under the cover of friends 
 A place where many lovers began 
 I began, to feel her body shake in my hand 
 Body language, it's so hard tryna understand 
 Usually after sex, it's a good feel 
 Took by silence, emotion stood still 
 I could feel, her tears spill from her grill 
 Hurt from before that began to build 
 She told me, "Hold me", a story she assembled it 
 Tellin' it, trying not to remember it 
 It was a story of innocence taken 
 Thought she could redeem, through love makin' 
 When she was eight, she was raped by her father 
 And tried to escape through multiple sex partners 
 Felt pitiful, she had only learned 
 To love through the physical, inside it burned 
 My heart turned, I thought of what this man did 
 She forgave him, she grew to understand it 
 Her soul was tired and never really rested 
 Only through men, through aggression 
 Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason 
 By speaking it, she found freedom 
 Between me and you 
  
 [Hook: Cee-Lo] 
 Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper 
 Still could be heard, without speaking a word 
 Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer 
 I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 She laid, I watched her breathe 
 Happy to be here, not afraid to leave 
 I couldn't concieve her not being here 
 Death in her face her not having fear 
 Less than a year, she was diagnosed with it 
 Memories of that year, so close and vivid 
 Happiness, would only visit, once in a while 
 To watch an adult, becoming a child 
 Somehow, I knew she'd make it 
 The life of one so given early, would God take it? 
 Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer 
 Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair 
 I stare with my eyes closed 
 Wonder when the body leave, does the mind go? 
 Watchin' Jordan became less important 
 Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs 
 According to doctors, there's no cure 
 We went through doubt, and cases of insure 
 Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs 
 Knew a part of her I could heal with words 
 But the creator was sending for her 
 What seemed like the end was the beginning for her 
 Like that, she didn't want us to remember her 
 No more medication did she want us to give to her 
 It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath 
 Only to be freed through death 
 Between me and you, between me and you 
 Between me and you, between me and you 
  
 [Hook: Cee-Lo] 
 Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper 
 Still could be heard, without speaking a word 
 Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer 
 I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled 
 A lump in his throat, his fear built 
 My whole life it was instilled 
 This ain't the way that men feel 
 A feeling, he said he wish he could kill 
 A feeling, not even time could heal 
 This is how real life's supposed to be? 
 For it to happen to someone close to me? 
 So far we'd come, for him to tell me 
 As he did, insecurity held me 
 I felt like he failed me 
 'Til his spirit yelled help me 
 I'd known him for like what seemed forever 
 About going pro we dreamed together 
 Never knew it would turn out like this 
 For so long he tried to fight this 
 Now it was no way for him to ignore it 
 His parents found out and hated him for it 
 How could I judge him? 
 Had to accept him if I truly loved him 
 No longer he said had he hated himself 
 Through sexuality he liberated himself 
 Between me and you, between me and you 
 Between me and you, between me and you 
  
 [Hook: Cee-Lo] 
 Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper 
 Still could be heard, without speaking a word 
 Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer 
 I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me 
  
 [Outro] 
 Liberation, peace[Hook: Queen Latifah] 
 I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close 
 Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you 
 I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart 
 And I hope I die 
 The next time that I see you 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I grew up, talking Chi-town slang 
 Never played soccer but loved to kick game 
 Loved chicks with thick frames 
 And big-lipped dames 
 Might see 'em on my arm 
 Cause I charm like thick chains 
 I was at the Knicks game, they were playing the Nets 
 Courtside so I could hear the shit they say to the refs 
 Thugs, this type of stuff you can't express in a text 
 See the section of girls who be dressing for checks 
 That's when she stepped in front of me 
 Light-skinned, long hair like a school days wannabe 
 A big 'ol (whoo) let's just say she was blessed 
 She had got it from her mama, God gave her the rest 
 We was being introduced by mutual friends 
 Like Kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins 
 Game begins, games begins 
 I'm from the windy city, so I play to win 
  
 [Hook: Queen Latifah] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 We conversated tough about life and stuff 
 Told her, tonight was just right for us 
 She was, flavor most and I can spice it up 
 Be my black Victoria Beckham once I wife it up 
 Asked when the next time we could speak 
 I might Khloe you, marry you in 3 weeks 
 Seen cheeks, she was like 'she don't remember my name' 
 That's when I realized ain't no gender in game 
 I thought, like "Man! You don't know me?" 
 I'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie 
 Boldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves' 
 Her friends said 'No, really though, he's a good dude' 
 After couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes 
 Being snapped by the papps, we shared the good news 
 We were engaged, though many was confused 
 I'm from the windy city, so I will not lose...come on 
  
 [Hook: Queen Latifah] 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 She had a dope figure, y'all can go figure 
 Should of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger 
 I ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it 
 Love happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock 
 Or could it be, things go the way that they should 
 From the, unexpected, love could be understood 
 And in the real game, only love can win 
 I got to win, cause I fell in love with her friend 
  
 [Hook: Queen Latifah][Intro] 
 Yo.. I don't know what was on y'all niggas' birds 
 To go up to the boat - and start robbin' old folks 
 Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady 
 You done went wild; yo, check it... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again 
 Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him 
 Four in the mornin, my phone ringin 
 I'm thinkin, "Who da fuck is this," on the other line screamin 
 Told em, "Geek down," but they was breathin hard 
 It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed 
 I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over 
 Freezin but this situation made the night colder 
 Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker 
 With some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub' 
 Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh) 
 Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile 
 Then BLAOW! They up mags 
 And told everybody, "Put your shit in the bag" 
 Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?) 
 Had the place took in a minute and some seconds 
 Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?) 
 Said she couldn't remember 
 She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em 
 Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me 
 With they pants hangin off they ass 
 Got her some water - and begin to think 
 How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink? 
 Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh) 
 Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real 
 'Cause yo, it's the big payback.. 
  
 {*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs} 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up 
 Them niggas probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut 
 Walked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..) 
 Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger 
 These niggas next to me, was talkin bout the heist 
 Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice 
 Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin 
 Had to use all my might not to ask no questions 
 Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine 
 Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling 
 They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team 
 A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring 
 This hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's 
 Was braggin bout robbery they had done 
 By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I 
 See gramps bracelet 
 I'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run 
 It's the big payback.. 
  
 {*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs} 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My imagination roamed as I got in the chair 
 Thinkin - when shit went 
 Down, I wish I was there 
 Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care 
 Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear 
 These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it 
 Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's 
 Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky 
 (Like who?) Like dude, that do drum'n'bass 
 There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious 
 Normally, they'd be 
 Talkin like bitches 
 My barber cut me with a quickness (what?) 
 Asked him where he got the new bracelet 
 He said it was his sister's - I knew then 
 What made it official, he gave me my change 
 The money clip had gramp's 
 Initials (c'mon) 
 As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up 
 Pulled up in a Cadillac truck 
 {*gunfire*} 
  
 [Police scanner] 
 ...we have an arson, three-alarm fire, murder in a possible homicide 
 The building is entitled "The Ultimate Barbershop" 
 There are six unidentified bodies in the building 
 They are all presumed dead 
 I repeat they are all presumed dead 
 However there are no suspects 
 I repeat, the subjects are at large 
 We might need some backup.. 
 Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over... 
 The skit definitely needs more siren added to it 
 Plus a new writer for the script, thank you... 
 Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please... 
 Thank you...One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two 
 One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two 
 One tigga One, One Two, One Two

 Dug Inf on production, my man Com for the discussion 
 Check it 
  
 [Common] 
 One day, I was tryin' to be myself 
 The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard!" 
 Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it 
 It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it 
 Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin' 
 I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin' 
 Pussy MC's stinkin' so I can't get hard 
 Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job 
 Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God 
 Even harder to be the Gods we created to be 
 This Western way of life ain't native to me 
 Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me? 
 I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes 
 Niggas, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows 
 I rose like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus 
 Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus 
 Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job 
 Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard 
 Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal 
 Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for 
 Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin' 
 Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business 
 Handle your business or shut the fuck up 
  
 [Chorus: Dug infinite and Common] 
 It's just one too many niggas got cars and no land 
 One too many niggas with cash and no plan 
 One too many niggas that's tryin to MC 
 That's one too many niggas comin up to me 
 That's one too many niggas 
 Just one too many niggas 
 That's one too many niggas 
 That's one too many niggas 
 Just one too many niggas 
  
 "One, two" 
  
 Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin 
 Shit that happened to me, I gotta let niggas know 
 This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo 
 Nigga, I don't even know myself 
 You want me to get you in 
 Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself 
 Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came 
 Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it 
 Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before 
 Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life? 
 Get you some pussy? you should be gettin' rump off GP 
 Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV 
 I be readin' niggas but readin' be makin' me sleepy (Hey!) 
 So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin 
 Niggas stuck on one and then I ran by 
 Claimin' they fly but they stand-by 
 I come truer than a dream, and you's a damn lie 
 With that anti-rap, complainin' about this and about that 
 Sounding bitch-like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right 
 I'm number one 
  
 [Chorus: Dug infinite and Common] 
 One too many niggas tryin' to tell me bout they theory 
 One too many niggas that ain't tryin' to hear me 
 One too many niggas doin' shows that don't happen 
 One too many niggas life depend on rappin' 
 That's one too many niggas 
 Just one too many niggas 
 Just one too many niggas 
 That's one too many niggas 
 Just one too many niggas 
  
 "One, two" 
  
 One two many niggas can't find they niche 
 One two many niggas wanna be my bitch 
  
 Nigga, one too many niggas[Pops] 
 Hey, hey old bean 
 And you to baby sweetness 
 Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio 
 And I didn't have to break in this time 
 I'm back as a special guest by special request 
 And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again 
 They may have to wrassle to get it back 
 You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world 
 Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family 
 From around the globe 
 He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes 
 From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan 
 And of course in the motherland 
 Even in the orient, they know what I meant 
 Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan 
 So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out 
 I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children 
 Who've been saying and doing the right things 
 You know they sat on those nines of 1999 
 And kept them from turning upside down 
 And teaching the babies 
 To love, to be able to give love 
 And to enter the new century with their own prophecy 
 The century of amends 
 You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours 
 And that we all travel the same path 
 It's just that we don't get there at the same time 
 (See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime 
 And to my children running around here 
 Talking about how nice is they ice 
 That they've already paid for twice 
 What karat is they gold 
 That was yours before you were done in the hole 
 Or that crew from 1629, buy some land 
 Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood 
 Which you claim you love so dear 
 Are you mankind or what kind of a man? 
 See, Pops is straight out of the garden 
 From when the world was starting brand new 
 Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the Underground Railroad 
 In it's purest form 
 Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad 
 If the message is not for you 
 It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze 
 So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high 
 I'm flying high with Cee-Lo 
 Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow 
 Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without The Roots 
 And Black Star said we are what we are 
 The Knowledge Of Self Determination 
 And my little homie KG 
 Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes 
 Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind 
 So if your heart is real 
 You will hear Big Will, and Mrs. Lauryn Hill 
 If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism 
 And you can't go right until you go left 
 And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff 
 Children, I've traveled this globe 
 North to south, east to west 
 And whenever my soul appears lost 
 I follow the musical sounds of a Tribe Called Quest 
 Okay, we ready to get out of here 
 We ready to take it home now 
 Just so everybody knows 
 When Pops get ready to say something good 
 I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood 
 And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky 
 That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Becky 
 Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist 
 I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children[Common] 
 Yeah, yo, yo, yo-yo, yo, yo 
 Yo, a touch of jazz y'all, yeah, yeah 
 ?? y'all, yo they got us on the run, like

 [Common] 
 It was once said by Black Thought that things fall apart 
 Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start 
 But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin 
 Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate 
 Friend or no friend, my man caught wind 
 This chick is payin me, it'll either cost me or cost him 
 Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago 
 Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo 
 I ain't here to start on this [nigga] for me to wreck his broad 
 You could tell what I thought of this [nigga] 
 Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes 
 (or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck 
 So I wasn't tryin to call his bluff, by his persona 
 You could see, he think he tough! 
 If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son 
 This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh

 [Common] 
 I understand that time is runnin out, I'm thinkin of town-skippin 
 Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin 
 I'm hittin rum straight, thinkin of a route to truncate 
 The streets is watchin, out is one way I put myself in his Nike's 
 His position is, "Aight man, somebody bonin my lady" 
 Probably snap like Rod-man 
 My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?) 
 'round four, when she was comin she would beep me 
 I sat deep in the corner, drinkin zombies, becomin one by now 
 Wonderin if my style would support her and her child 
 Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?) 
 One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried 
 Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot 
 On some "Nobody's Supposed to Be Here" [shit] like Deborah Cox 
 Looked at my watch, [shit] I don't even got a watch 
 Felt for my Glock, damnit I don't even got a Glock, yo

 Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..) 
  
 [Common] 
 Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin 
 It ain't good lookin, like a black promoter I'm talkin bookin 
 Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him 
 But he was on the horn informin the rest of them hoodlums (aight) 
 Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine 
 Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time 
 My pager went off, it read one line: "Come get me 
 From Halsted," I'm thinkin this is monkey bar [shit] 
 Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy 
 Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy 
 Wondered if this plan was designed to get me 
 I've been drinkin too strong to be thinkin too long 
 Like 40 goin North I'm doin 50, headed for the spot 
 Askin God to be with me, and lately 
 She has been actin shifty -- (but what?) 
 But then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me) 
 It hit me (hit me) it hit me

 Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (Yo -- I said I, don't, know)

 (and we out..)[Chorus] 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown 
 Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun 
 If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground 
 Cut up and sold sold, by the pound pound 
 I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound 
 Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down down 
 Never wore a leash but I get loose 
 Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots 
 Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers 
 So amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka 
 I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow 
 Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico 
 The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals 
 Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo 
 Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears 
 The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, "Hell yeah" 
 Correction, "Hell yes"; old folks wanna cuss 
 On how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess 
 But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight 
 Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake 
 Back to our regularly scheduled program, program 
 I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam 
 Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian 
 Cause see I want it quiet in here... 
 I Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases 
 Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises 
 To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors 
 I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold 
 And reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male 
 And I can't tell, why for a ho you grow a tail 
 And stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell 
 Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid 
 Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid 
 Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass 
 If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache 
 I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black 
 It's like McDonald's sellin fatback 
 Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks 
 I'm hearin rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks 
 You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter 
 When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer 
 I'mma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups 
 Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops 
 I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far 
 I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R 
 Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles 
 But you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker 
 Think of that boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta 
 Is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk 
 If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk 
 If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff 
 It's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents 
 In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff 
 I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian 
 I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum 
 Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian 
 And turn off the lights this is the likes of a 
 Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother 
 Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter 
 A chick is a chick that's how I treat her 
 Never go pop I'm not a two liter 
 A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow 
 Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto 
 Wear em? No, share em? A ho 
 I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro 
 Cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations 
 That holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound" 
 "Gimme a pound, thank you man" 
 "Gimme a pound"[Hook: Jill Scott] 
 Candy sweet, your words of bedtime 
 I was just saying to myself the other day 
 Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching 
 Because of this I must say 
 I (I) I (oh I) 
 I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah 
 (I) I (oh I) 
 I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold 
 The lives I've affected, connect and control 
 With me in your basement your mama got blowed 
 I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles 
 Through me the black experience is glorious told 
 From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold 
 And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them 
 On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them 
 Mash with them, at the party and all 
 Be the universal language that's embodying all 
 Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all 
 Y'all feel most high, when I be in y'all 
 System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie 
 Shame I rely on record labels to push me 
 Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape 
 Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes 
 I am music 
  
 [Hook: Jill Scott] 
 Candy sweet, your words of bedtime

 [Verse 2: Common] 
 You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive 
 I opened the eyes of many 
 Styles y'all wrote in the skies with your lows and highs 
 Open your mind to hear me 
 In the streets I beat cops and obsolete 
 On every station that's hot, you can't stop my heat 
 I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat 
 On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak 
 I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam 
 Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan 
 Live I be killing it man 
 For how long I survived, yo I'm realer than man 
 Got a soft side but I'm still a man 
 For me, women cry, and children dance 
 I'm tryna eat, I coulda got a meal and ran 
 But like Sly for the fam, still I stand 
 I am music

 [Verse 3: Common] 
 I been here since the beginning 
 Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time 
 Deep in the mind of the ancient ones 
 Everybody love me like they do the sun 
 I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark 
 You can't categorize me, my mind's a art 
 Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts 
 I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart 
 The change that came, the change that comes 
 I change with chords and I kick it with drums 
 Get blown with horns and did it on the one 
 Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung 
 Spun around the world at parties and weddings 
 Wherever I go, I create the setting 
 You know me from lessons or your pop's collection 
 Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing 
 Yo, I am music

 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Ohhh... 
 Everything's gone be alright 
 If you play your cards right 
 Everything's gone be alright... 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 It's do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver 
 I revolve around the world, a problem solver 
 Alter your ego, and the way your walkin' 
 Talk to people, still I stay regal 
 Read through the bullshit 
 Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip 
 Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price 
 Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right 
 It's the good life, like T.I. said 
 Gettin' it, how could I not be fed 
 Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo' 
 In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low 
 Let problems burn slow away 
 I yearn for the day that it won't go gray 
 Remember we were kings, back in the day 
 Still can be, depending on the cards you play 
  
 [Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)] 
 If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right) 
 Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I ain't playin' with a full deck 
 The government won't let me get a full check 
 I'm taxin' marks, I got more heart than clubs 
 The black spade, givin' 'em darker love 
 Make 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face 
 You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes 
 It's high like the ace is 
 Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift 
 You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds 
 Leave you nickle-less, like Jack in "Shining" 
 Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen 
 Took your chips, let my guys in Texas Hold 'Em 
 Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players 
 Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major 
 Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life 
 Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right 
  
 [Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)] 
 If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right) 
 Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)) 
  
 [Hook 2: Bilal (repeat 2x)] 
 Ohh... 
 If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right) 
 Everything's... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)) 
  
 [Accapella: Bilal] 
 Yeah... Ohhh... 
  
 Everything's gone be alright, if you play your cards right 
 Everything's gone be alright...[Intro] 
 What we have here is a very, serious delicate situation 
 Lots of people out here always ridin the dick, hmmph 
 But check this out 
 I like your style, I like your stride 
 And I like your motivation 
 But the Late Show, we ain't standin for that shit 
 So my man right here he wrote a little song about it 
 Why don't you sing it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ring the, alarm, here comes, the Com 
 Call me Mr. Hollywood -- check it out! 
 Ring the, alarm, here comes, the Com 
 Call me Mr. Hollywood 
 On the Goodship, Lollipop 
 Pop goes the lolli lolli, for I'm, the Jolly 
 Good Fellow, he-llo? Is anybody there?

 Because I Rock-well I always feel like, I always feel like 
 Somebody's watchin me, ooh, somebody's watchin me 
 It's gotta be that, that that that nigga that sweat my shit 
 I say say say, "Black get off the 'zack you block my urinal tract" 
 I gotta go pee-pee, yo you don't know me 
 You're just a new kid on my jock, tip-seekin and you're phony 
 It's my little pony and you cannot get a ride 
 So when you see me homey, just please just step aside 
 Step aside, not talkin wlidside, I'm comin from the Southside 
 Where the ruffnecks reign; if you can't stand it, don't go outside 
 Cause it's hot I got the stuff to call your bluff and pull your card 
 And nowadays it's all these dick kids, that wanna be hard 
 You're fraudulent, I can tell a pussy by his scent 
 So sorry, but the van got tipped 
 And out is how I'm lookin, I'm lookin out for my people 
 I'm fly like I'm fly like but me don't have no eagle 
 Beat the beater with the juice, how far would you go to 
 You're never gonna get it, woo-wooh-wooh-wooh! 
 You wasn't down from the jump, so why you wanna criss cross? 
 You no business buyin, insecure junkyard motherfucker 
 Get lost, cause youse a sucker 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 Yo can lick me everywhere 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 We really lucky we got em, you can spot em 
 From a distance, now let's just say for instance 
 You got a crank gettin ganked for his bank by some snake 
 Little wench -- is you is, or is you ain't 
 The sucker 
 You gotta gotta be, gotta be, to let the shit occur 
 Gettin pimped, by a ho, that ain't too proud to beg, for your dough 
 She get your money mo money mo money money mo! 
 I couldn't go out like that if it was my first day off of punishment 
 Just call me Kaopectate; in relationships, I'm runnin shit 
 So don't be comin to me with that, "We can go out, you pay" 
 Cancel that bitch, it's the, unamerican way 
 This is the circumcision, and skins is gettin cut off 
 Ridin on my shit, just to get they nut off 
 Not, no cops, just low-downs want a lick 
 If you ain't down with the 'Van, dyke, get off the dick 
 Cause I remember the time, the time, the time you tried 
 To play me like I was booty but now you're just a groupie 
 Sweatin me uhh, sweatin me uhh 
 Tellin me when I get big don't be forgettin me uhh 
 But forget you, forgot you, after, I rock you 
 It's Blo Pop time bitch, you better set your clock 
 To the Charms Alarm 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 I'll be your lollipop 
 Yo can lick me everywhere 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Why'd the sucker MC sucker MC cross the road? 
 To get to the other side?! 
 Why'd the sucker MC sucker MC cross the road? 
 To get to the other side, now check it out 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I got the pep in my step, the slide in my glide 
 So I won't trip, when I let my backbone slip 
 Some shake it to the East, I'm shakin West, well I'mma shake your mid 
 And I'mma get you suckaz, just give me one side, and one rib 
 I barbeque the mouths, hey, I barbeque the mouths 
 Cause mom always said - don't play wack in the house! 
 So take that garbage to the backyard 
 And I was like, "Everybody wanna wanna rap hard" 
 Before you wasn't hardcore, so Sonic why ya flipped? 
 How you gonna hop when you ain't hip? 
 You found rap, on a two-way street - and lost it 
 On a parkway, I ain't sayin no names, yo Rico Suave 
 Fuckin goons fakin stab wounds, I need to shank the crank 
 Elvis Presley Jr., tryin to be somethin that you ain't 
 No daps, y'all are hoes, y'all go on stage 
 And take off all your clothes; then you strike a pose 
 You knows and I knows, that's how you sell your record 
 Because your shit is butt, you gotta get naked 
 But you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me 
 I said you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me 
 You got no soul man, and you need to get a pound 
 Cause you, ain't, really down with true hip-hop you suckersThis the city of Chicago 
 The state of confusion 
 The style I'm using is free 
 Or at least it would be if my mind was 
 Peep I'm behind cause 
 I didn't handle my function while in high school 
 Although I was cool 
 The hood I live in ain't that proper 
 Cause a cop a stop ya 
 And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty 
 I'm not filthy 
 Nor am I rich 
 Ain't that a bitch 
 Like life is 
 Not your wife is 
 See that your better halve 
 Do your math 
 And peep that two halves make a whole 
 And all I have to hold 
 Is my self pride 
 So these streets I strive 
 Like a Black Panther 
 Asking can the 
 Situation get much worst 
 All I do is try to appeal to the masses 
 As the phrase keep it real passes 
 The teeth of too many phoney individuals 
 Snakes, that smooth like criminals 
 They create chemicals 
 That the Earth hate 
 Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate 
 I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait 
 Or at least my weight in precious gems 
 So I'm steadily steadly steadly 
 Trying to lose my religion, like R E M 
 Created in His own image so are we him? 
 And through all this crises 
 Shid(Shit) I wonder where Christ is 
 Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds 
 Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up 
 And Stone run it 
 Hunted by police for display in state vile cages 
 Come out to make minimum wages 
 And with a desiese that are contagious 
 It is fucking outrages 
 The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up 
 But the Most High encourages me to put the Glock up 
 And Stock up on do for self knowledge 
 A brother couldn't afford to go to collage 
 So I had to learn form the school of hard knock 
 On the hard blocks of the Chi 
 Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks 
 As my liver soaks 
 In mad Hennesy 
 Cause I got a bad tendency 
 To do a lot of drinking 
 But now I do a lot of thinking 
 Blinking, was your third eye 
 When you heard I 
 Was one of the chosen one 
 Industry doors keep closing 
 (sing) Watch the closing doors 
 Niggas want a record deal 
 But can they deal with a record? 
 Cause once they get rich 
 They tend to switch 
 Like a sissy 
 Please miss me 
 With all that bullshit you popping 
 This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping 
 Even if you had one of them red octagon 
 Motherfuckers say Malik how you make your living? 
 I say by breathing oxygen[Hook] 
 I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close 
 Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you 
 I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart 
 And I hope I die 
 The next time that I see you 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A cloudy day in the Chi 
 I was downtown getting my license 
 Money ain't a thang but hey, fame is priceless 
 Waiting in line, yeah that's one of my vices 
 This lady recognized me and moved me through the line quick 
 To number one, said sign this for her son 
 I drew my name with a Bible and a gun 
 One of her coworkers had a cousin in rap 
 Can't knock his hustle, but I be doing him like Skinny Pete 
 In the back, they was playin' light jazz 
 Spotted this woman with light plus she had a bright ass 
 I was checking her out trying to act like I ain't checking her out 
 She could see that I was checking her out 
 On some Roy Ayers, we was vibing a bit 
 Told her my next album gonna be live with the hits 
 She did a skit on how she don't be dating rappers 
 Said I got my SAG card baby I'm an actor 
 And after the laughter I said, "naw for real" 
 She said, "naw for real, forreal?" 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some days it's the sun, some days it's the rain 
 Some chicks you forget, some stay in your brain 
 Somehow in my mind this broad still remain 
 Three days later, I'm about to get on the plane 
 In the security lane, the thing kept beeping 
 It's probably these hard raps that I be keeping 
 Speaking of the goddess, I picked up my metal objects 
 You know how you can bring to life what's in your conscience 
 Slim with the pompous attitude from the DMV 
 Happened to have a beautiful ass in front of me 
 Yup, I'm looking and she sort of took it in 
 That awkward moment of "damn, damn, that's him again" 
 I start telling her how beautiful her thoughts are 
 A man walked up, she said "this is Walter" 
 I looked at a little Walter as he stuck out his hand 
 Said since Borrow a Dollar, he been a fan 
 Said he met me at a show about four years ago 
 I'm thinking Goof Troop, I don't remember that shit 
 I told him that I didn't so I ended that quick 
 On the Ice Cube tip, like stay off my dick 
 And tell your chick to come here 
 Yeah, I gotta word I want to give to her ear 
 And it goes like 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I can't be lusting another man's woman too long 
 I picked up my pride to the gate, I moved on 
 With the nike airs on, stepping into first class 
 Wondering why these flight attendants don't be having no ass 
 One asked if I wanted a drink 
 I laid back and just said naw I wanted to think 
 About how and why old girl was affecting me 
 Opened my eyes her and dude was right next to me 
 Was this destiny like the Jackson Five? 
 I was shocked inside, but I reacted live 
 Told her every time I think of her she actualize 
 I said fate baby ain't something to rationalize 
 Seen passion in her eyes as my words hit her 
 She said Walter wasn't her nigga, he just work with her 
 We dipped to the bathroom so she could try my love 
 Now she's a member of the mile high club 
  
 [Hook][Hook: Cee-Lo] 
 Yeah the sun is shining brighter 
 Cause she make my day 
 Yeah, you really make my day 
 Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh 
 Yeah, I think I like her 
 Cause she really makes my day 
 Yeah, she really makes my day 
 Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Seen her on the beach, she was wrapped in a towel 
 Her body's so endowed, seen her ass, cracked a smile 
 Enjoying the Nile, taking the breeze in 
 On some cat and mouse and she was, just cheesing 
 The sun eased in our conversation 
 California dreamin' 'bout Californication 
 Said she had some drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation 
 If I wanted I could brew up, this is just an indication 
 Of how cool she was 
 A couple chicks came up with their groupie love 
 They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged 
 I'm thinkin' DAMN, damn, that's really cool because 
 Sometimes I wanna chill 
 Sometimes the best things in life are not in your plans 
 You came to the sand and got more than a tan 
 Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way 
 Take a ride on the highway and pretend like it's Friday and it is 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 She was at a barbecue 
 Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes 
 She was 'show and tell' like it was grammar school 
 Sipping on some ale, I'm thinking, "Man, she cool!" 
 Sun smiling on her hair 
 Hey, they playing spades and we can be a pair 
 She had a spread on her, I can see it from her chair 
 I love it when it's sunny, girl, you could be my Cher 
 It's, Independence Day and free is in the air 
 We danced and danced away, yo 
 Showed her how to step, it's like a tango 
 From her body angle, I can tell she like me 
 She got me a flav, girl you're sweet as Icee 
 Spicy talk, the sauce drip from my lips 
 Take tricks and let's dip, we can do something hip 
 Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A 
 Let your worries blow away like it's all okay, and it is!

 Cut up and sold, sold, by the pound for pound

 Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down 
 Never wore a leash but I'm a show ya 
 How loose is my goose, got more soul than combat boots 
 ("I got soul, you got it!") That's why I came 
 They keep callin me, man, they keep callin me, they call my name

 Spoiled as a child, but now I'm milk like similac 
 Don't have Cinemax, because my cable's pirated 
 Bug out wit the rhyme, try to swat and I'll get fly wit it 
 For pest control, I suggest some soul 
 As far as dick I got it but I have no breath control

 C'mon, can I get a clap? 
 Can't you see I'm trapped, and I'm so confused 
 Dues is gettin' paid but what about the bills 
 I wanna make some dough yet I wanna show my skills 
 Do you even know where I'm goin? 
 I ain't scared of you motherfucker, though I am of the Omen 
 I jam like a Cult but make note, I'm not Koresh 
 Cause I control minds with rhymes 
 So FBI don't test, I got a no. 2 pencil 
 And I'm a scribble all over your faaaace! 
 You see I don't pack no gat 
 I didn't see CB4 cause I heard that shit was wack

 Peace to No ID and my nigga Y-not!

 Well, go see the doctor — in your car, rock my tune

 My main man, my son Common Sense 
 They used to call me no sense 
 Now they say I got plenty sense - about 6,000 years of it 
 You know, I’m just checking him out 
 See what’s going on, cause I’m always sitting around telling him about 
 What we used to do back in our hood, you know 
 We used to be down and run this town 
 And it was all at PC Pub 
 You know, and I’m shaking 
 And they working on it, and they bringing it back 
 I see harmony, understanding 
 And they working on that love thing too 
 Cause they be down with it, you know? 
 Now I hear them saying things like, whoa whoa, I get a good feeling 
 I be saying “keep it up 
 Keep on moving with your groove, you’re going the right way" 
 Cause it’s got to be in your heart 
 And I can tell by your beat you got it 
 See there, I can do a little piece, put them together there 
  
 Yea, we used to be running this whole town, here 
 We used to be basketball playing brothers, you know 
 Now everybody’s playing basketball 
 I wonder where they come from? What they claiming? 
 Gonna make an old man get his shoes out 
 And throw one down to slam dunk on them 
 Every time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year 
 I can say yea it’s time to play some 
 What these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath? 
 What you say? 
 Well I tell what, we’re gonna try something brand new here 
 Cause everybody like new things 
 We’re gonna work on something new, and I’m gonna call it ‘peace’ 
 We’re gonna pretend like its 6 years old 
 And we gonna build it and mould it 
 And nurture it and culture it 
 And grow right into our society for all of us to have 
 Do you believe in the peace? 
 Not that piece, but do you believe in the peace? 
 Alright, I see you raising your hand - you believe in the peace 
 OK, bring it 
 See if I can’t talk common sense into them 
 Let’s cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know? 
 Eh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87 
 47 was my hood, 87 was his 
 Touchdown 
 What’s the name of the bangers in this town now? 
 Has everybody calmed down? 
 Back in my day, they was showing up, now they finally woke up 
 I hear they leaving it alone 
 Using words like 'truce', I love to hear that[Verse 1: Common] 
 Hot damn, black America again 
 Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind 
 The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin 
 The darker it gets the less fairer it has been 
 The hate, the hate made, I inherited from them 
 But I ain't gon' point the finger 
 We got anointed singers 
 Like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie 
 Need to hear them songs 
 Sometimes to believe me 
 Who freed me, Lincoln or Cadillac? 
 Drinking or battle raps? 
 Or is it God's speed that we travel at 
 Endangered in our own habitat 
 Them guns and dope, man y'all can have it back 
 As a matter fact, we them lab rats 
 You built the projects for, now you want ya hood back 
 I guess if you could rap, you would express it too 
 That PTSD, we need professionals 
 You know what pressure do, it makes the pipes bust 
 From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us 
 'Til your political parties invite us 
 Instead of making voting laws to spite us 
 You know, you know we from a family of fighters 
 Fought in, our wars and your wars, you put a nigga in Star Wars 
 Maybe you need two, and then maybe then we'll believe you 
 See black people, in the future, we wasn't shipped here 
 To rob and shoot ya 
 We hold these truths to be self-evident 
 All men and women are created equal, including black Americans 
 Yeah, that's black America again 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 We go here, we go here, here we go again 
 Trayvon'll never get to be an older man 
 Black children, they childhood stole from them 
 Robbed of our names and our language, stole again 
 Who stole the soul from black folk? 
 Same man that stole the land from chief black smoke 
 And made the whip crackle on our back slow 
 Made us go through the back door 
 And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks 
 Now we slaves to the blocks cause on 'em we spray shots 
 Leaving our own to lay in a box 
 Black mothers' stomach stay in a knots 
 We kill each other, more than the cops 
 I wish the hating would stop 
 We are at war, in a battle with us 
 I know that black lives matter, do they matter to us? 
 These are the things we gotta discuss 
 The new plantation, mass-incarceration 
 Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids 
 As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is 
 Is it a felony? or a misdemeanor? 
 Maria Sharapova making more than Serena 
 It took Viola Davis to say this 
 The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us 
 We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers 
 The salt of the Earth, they get the salt with sugar 
 And greasy foods, I don't believe the news 
 Or radio, stereotypes we refuse 
 Brainwashed in the cycle to spin 
 We write our own story, black America againThey’ve been using this system to will their power. So it's kind of like a slippery slope to teach their children, to teach your children, to respect something that shows no respect, for a lack of better terms...you know what I mean? You hit a good thing on the head, saying about how educating the youth early and often about relationships going forward[Intro] 
 What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Check it, yo 
 You say a one for the trouble, two for the time 
 Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I can feel the funk 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I come to grips with mics 
 I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes 
 I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton 
 Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight 
 When I got light like an intersection, you talk 
 But you came to my town with protection 
 Election year, had the block hot 
 I scream "fuck the world" but having a baby girl sorta cock-blocked 
 I write rhymes like I come from the windy city 
 With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality 
 Casually, I walk through these war games 
 Some claim saved but then they take on whore names 
 If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane 
 If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place 
 It ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face 
 The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass 
 What you wanna do girl(wanna shout) 
 To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggas 
 It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor 
 You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker 
 What you wanna do man?(let go) 
 Yo, check it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Some niggas be on the mic, sounding like dikes 
 Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh) 
 Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation 
 Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager 
 In the age of Aquarius, various things 
 Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you 
 Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons 
 Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms 
 Every black moon, a rap tune move me 
 The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played 
 It don't stop 
 It's time to get it, get it made 
 I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face 
 I know how the underground tastes 
 I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace 
 Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers 
 Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin 
 Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years 
 Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I can feel the funk 
  
 I came through the corridor, with the aura 
 Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror 
 Read between the lines and know the border 
 Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water 
 Waitin for you Big Willie niggas to have a show at The Crib 
 We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is 
 Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather 
 The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather 
 I rap better than you, you, or maybe him 
 But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb 
 Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly 
 Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly 
 But then they fall off, dusted niggas is gettin sawed off 
 They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off 
 I kick ass 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I can feel the funkBreathe 
  
 Sometimes the monster that’s inside you 
 Is a monster that is mad 
 It’s a monster who is angry 
 It’s a monster who feels bad 
 When your monster wants to grow things 
 And your monster wants to shout 
 There’s a way to calm your monster and chill your inner monster out 
  
 Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it 
 Belly breathe this is how you do it 
 Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it

 Put your hands on your belly and you slowly breathe in

 Belly breathe this is how you do it 
 Ba ba breathe belly belly 
 Ba ba ba ba breathe belly belly breathe 
  
 Your mad monster may appear at any time and any place 
 And that mad monster will make you make a mad monster face 
 He makes you want to push he makes you want to shove 
 There’s a way to calm that monster bring out the monster love! 
  
 Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it 
 Belly breathe this is how you do it 
 Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it 
 Belly breathe this is how you do it 
  
 Feel your belly go out and in and in and out 
 That’s what belly breathing is all about! 
  
 Feel your belly go in and out and out and in 
 And now I feel like myself again! 
  
 Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it 
 Belly breathe this is how you do it 
 Belly belly breathe 
 Belly belly breathe 
 Everybody just breathe![Hook x2] 
 Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature 
 I'm just trying to motivate ya 
 Electricity is definitely there 
 I got shocked when I touched your hair 
 Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex 
 Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex 
 Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex 
 Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Girl, ooh, you look "uh" 
 You're the type of thick that I can't give up 
 What's your name? I can't hear ya 
 Will it be alright if I called you "Suga"? 
 You could call me "Smokey", I'll be the "Bear" 
 Your smell is sexy, it's all in the air 
 Whatcha got girl is so unfair 
 I like the way you move, so keep it right there 
 Or you can do what you wanna do 
 I'm just glad I'm in front of you 
 But I don't mind being behind 
 Cause I'ma touch you where the sun don't shine 
 Got my hand on my money while you on the grind 
 In tune with you, cause you so fine 
 And when you wine, it's genuine 
 Get on my vine and we can climb 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Heard you used to dance at Magic City 
 The other girls couldn't have been half as pretty 
 You look so sexy when you grab them-- 
 Ooh; oh yes 
 Suga good Lord, you've been blessed 
 If this is a sin, I must confess 
 The way you dress, is like burlesque 
 I guess you don't mind being undressed 
 I like the way it's going down 
 Hips are moving all around 
 Round and round, upside down 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Sweetheart, can you give me another round? 
 Sweating like you losing pounds 
 Touch the ground, making sounds 
 Suga ooh Suga, you wear the crown 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Bridge] 
 All that dancing, Suga 
 Make me want to do ya 
 The way you move and shake it 
 Ah ah, on the dance floor 
 Wanna touch and feel ya 
 We can get familiar 
 The way you move and shake it 
 Make me want you some more 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Ooh, you making my nature rise 
 We can do more than fantasize 
 Let's do the do, me and you 
 We can whoa-oh-whoa and whoopty whoo 
 Your physique brings out my freak 
 I like the way your body speaks 
 I want some of you every day of the week 
 Suga Suga, you ain't nothing sweet, uh 
  
 [Hook x2][Intro: Common] 
 Yeah, for the world! 
 Keep going so you can, yo, you can rock on 
 We keep going so you can, yo, you can rock on 
 We keep going so you can, yo, you can rock on 
 We keep going 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Nigga breathe, I can tell by how you rap you don't believe 
 Ain't hungry no more, so off me you feed 
 I hustle at a speed between greed and need 
 On the streets where intuition and weed are breed 
 Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift 
 My rhyme the clip, it's like the boom bip to tip 
 In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way 
 Spending nights over Egypt to learn a brave day 
 Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ 
 You're the Ray J of this rap world 
 I travel the globe with a black girl named Becky 
 Grand like Auto Theft 3 
 Style so developed, the law can't arrest me 
 You walk with blood on your shirt like Jesse 
 Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people 
 See through, tryna out act Don Cheadle 
 I speak to original Hebrews, you know how we do 
 And bleed through the needle with truth 
 That needs no preview to proof, it's in the people 
 And how they react, still in the business of smacking 
 Rappers is wack, you had a dope track, I guess opposites attract 
 My mind state is black, black like Bernie Mac 
 No cowards, soul power in the words we rap 
  
 [Hook] 
 As, as 
 As we walk together 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul, soul, soul power 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul, soul, soul, soul 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples 
 My guy buy ice, I search for the dark crystal 
 Racing for paper, these broads is starter pistols 
 I spit through gang wars and strange doors 
 Out the sky, flames pour, the beats claims war 
 I see niggas with flags, who they waving them for? 
 I'm the nigga, that you put the chain on the door for 
 The nigga, that you started changing the laws for 
 Orator of hardcore and more 
 My raps the portal for the blue collar 
 You made a hit and came up on a few dollars 
 I'd rather listen to silence than you holla 
 Borrowed your persona from the late that made Dear Mama 
 My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy 
 For truth your a decoy 
 Common Sense is like the future of the B-boy 
 I fall down and get up like Don McClurkin 
 Hit push and listen to it whistle while I'm twerkin' 
 Break it down like herb 
 The nympho of info, I'm fucking what you heard 
 You ain't ready for war, you're stuck in the reserves 
 I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds 
 I've been wanting to fly so now I do it with the words 
 For those in the fast lane, I'll show you how to merge 
 Get your own 
 You see, it's like home grown herb black economics 
 The people we serve with soul power 
  
 [Hook] 
 As we walk together 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul, soul, soul, soul 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul power (soul power!) 
 Soul, soul, soul, soul 
 Soul power (soul power!)[Verse 1] 
 It's Com Sense, y'all -- you know I'm rhyming in heaven 
 Come to rock it at Hot 93 point 7 
 You know how it goes, the way I spark words 
 In Connecticut, yo, I'm in Hartford 
 Down the street, y'all, understand I'm colder than winter 
 I could go after this, then go to Sportscenter 
 Go to the campus, Com Sense'll be on the canvas to paint it 
 They say ain't it 
 That boy from Chicago, you could follow 
 Me on Twitter -- yo, your babysitter 
 Better get a new one, cause I be the through one 
 Coming through some different type of things 
 I got many dreams 
 The Dreamer and Believer 
 Get you open like a wide receiver 
 I'm a high achiever 
 I know they came down, I came to jam 
 They said I should have came to the Jingle Jam 
 I am that brother that went to FAMU 
 Never getting stuck, chilling with Nance and Buck 
 And this is how it goes, yo, I always kick flows 
 Next year I'm coming to the Jingle Jam shows 
 Or maybe we could do it in the spring or the summer 
 When it comes to this, I came from the ground under 
 And now it's going on, we keep going on 
 I came to Hartford so I could film Pawn 
 Pawn, yo, Com Sense 
 I got wits for acres like Forest Whitaker 
 The money maker, rhyme shaker 
 Let you know I got the odor 
 Funky like that, I did a film with Ray Liotta 
 And I could keep turning it over and over and over with flows 
 They seen me earlier at Mo's 
 Getting a little breakfast 
 Yo, you could check this 
 That girl said, I got things that's on your checklist 
 And yeah, it's all good when I come down 
 Went to the mall, I didn't stall and 
 Never will I fall so 
 I will ball like the brothers do in Paris 
 When it come to this, Com Sense got will just like a Ferris 
 Yo, I keep going hard and hard 
 When it come to this, emcees, they getting scarred 
 I get right here on this old-school beat 
 They keep asking me who I'm talking 'bout in "Sweet" 
 Is it that guy or this guy? This is just, just shy 
 When it come to this, Com Sense, I guess I get high 
 High off the style like Wiz Khalifa 
 Look for the album, The Dreamer and Believer[Produced By: Kanye West] 
  
 [Intro: Common] 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I open my eyes, the corner's like African tribes 
 The blackest of thighs, a blackened surprise where passion arise 
 The youth fantasize of grass and cash in they eyes 
 A youth dies, and momma's asking rationalize 
 Trying to build a spot where ghetto bastards can rise 
 The ghetto's been bastardized by those that capitalize 
 Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised 
 To bring his people to a land where blacks are despised 
 To act you lie scriptures, the rich are getting richer 
 The young are becoming thicker, summers becoming winter 
 Hard times, hard liquor link cards and God figures 
 It's moments that completes us to piece us with scar niggas 
 The corners I picture in motion it stars niggas 
 Emotions of those that be smoking like Todd Bridges 
 These are our bridges, from nothing to something 
 That's why on every city block, you hear them pumping 
 The corner 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins in 
 Yellow and pink and collared blue 
 Profiles glorifying them 
  
 [Verse 2: Scarface] 
 On the corner, birth place of various dreams 
 The ending of the beginning, the scariest thing 
 As we survive here to die here, whatever we seen 
 We accept it, live with it, or better the scheme 
 On the corner, the backdrop for hustling crack rock 
 The spot where the mac stops to issue the pack's out 
 There's money on the corner you'd be stupid to pass up 
 Remember there's a code and if it's broken we blast ya 
 There's Crips on the corner, Bloods on the corner 
 GDs and vice lords so there's thugs on the corner 
 There's children having fun so there's love on the corner 
 OGs with triple beams holding drugs on the corner 
 There's cops on the corner 
 Dope fiends that walk around in they socks is on the corner 
 But I love 'em, so I'm on 'em 
 It's life on the corner, death on the corner 
 We fight until our very last breath on the corner 
 Corner 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 [Verse 3: Yasiin Bey] 
 (The corner man!) C-O-R-N-E-R 
 My nigga, it's the corner, every city block got 4 of em' 
 It's simple math, something jumping off on all them (break it down) 
 The church, the chicken shack, the liquor store, the dope house 
 The bail bonds, the nail salon, the barber shop, the courthouse 
 The young are blowing their smoke out, he high five 
 They're 'bout it 'bout it, no power outage for live wires 
 The block wild and shots fired from hot eyes 
 A cold world full of hot summers and loud sirens (woo) 
 The 'caine slangers and gang bangers and lane changers (ha) 
 Elders anxiety prone, them rigid teenagers 
 They're whispering: 
 "Man, you can't save him, the streets raised him" 
 They on the block like they ain't neighbors 
 They're straight strangers 
 Grandmama hit me with 3 words: "Son, keep praying" 
 This shorty hit me with 3 more, "Son, keep blazing" 
 They're both deep statements, from two unique places 
 Real forever real, I just love to hear the streets say it 
 Corner 
  
 [Hook: Kanye West] 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
  
 [Spoken Word: The Last Poets] 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner[Metro Scene Excerpt] 
  
 Woody: I'm really tired, I'm going home 
  
 Vincent: We ain't got no home man...... 
 Your grandmother can't take care of you......I'm all you got. 
  
 Woody: well if you're all I got, then why you hit me...and put me thru all this today? 
  
 Vincent: Cause I ain't got nobody either...people I thought I trusted...I can't trust...I don't know what they were doing ...man I'm just telling you I don't know. 
  
 Woody: and why did you say that about my mother 
  
 Vincent: I love your mother...I love you too man...Wood I love you Bruh...Im gonna take care of you...I just need this money...I need it...I need this money...(softly) I need it. I promise I'll take you to North Carolina... 
  
 Woody: Tonight... 
  
 Vincent: Tonight.[Intro: Q-Tip] 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga 
 Whoever you are, whoever you are 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping 
 Somewhat like the girl X-rating 
 It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation 
 Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing 
 Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation 
 Without somebody breaking in my demonstration 
 For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net 
 It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet 
 Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys 
 Because his job had been stopped smoking weed 
 Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed 
 For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need 
 The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it 
 Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with 
 She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken 
 I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking 
 The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype 
 Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike 
 Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating 
 Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived 
 In this house with three kids, one I was cool with 
 As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music 
 Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect 
 The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck 
  
 [Dialogue from "King of New York" and "Scarface"] 
 -Just tell me why. Don't lie to me, man, just tell me why! 
 -It's the money, alright? 
 -Just tell me why! 
 -It's the fucking money, alright?? 
 (Fight noises)

 It ain't sweet when you do that shit 
 It ain't sweet when you do that shit

 [Verse] 
 There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve 
 Can't understand who the fuck was involved 
 Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane 
 In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame 
 My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy 
 Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby 
 As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built 
 By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled 
 I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt 
 In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt 
 My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit 
 As usual, niggas is suspects 
 Who did I tell I was going out of town? 
 Not too many people, I guess the word got around 
 The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound 
 Must have came in during the day when at work they was found 
 At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it 
 Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds 
 Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted 
 And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day 
 Before I left, this thief decided to play chef 
 Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast 
 I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house 
 Thinking whoever came in on me is out 
  
 [Outro] 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, yes it is 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, hear me now 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, yes it is 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, hear me nowI feel rugged, I am rugged, damn rugged 
 I walk on the carpet of the universe 
 Keep on 
  
 And speak on shit most are scared or unprepared 
 But I fled for my people 
 So keep on 
  
 Beyond space I look for a place to put hurt 
 I gotta work 
 Keep on 
  
 Dreams of Black roads, of Black souls that act holistic 
 It's realistic 
 Keep on 
  
 Pharoah of the sun looking down the barrel of a gun 
 Y’all know where I’m from 
 Keep on 
  
 Niggas at the crib saying Rash look weird 
 From myself I never hid 
 Keep on 
  
 Niggas at the crib say for them I never did 
 30 year old kids, shit boy 
 Keep on 
  
 Any means necessarian, vegetarian 
 I be missin' chicken 
 Keep on 
  
 Request for another Resurrection 
 The way I rhyme before progression 
 This ain’t ’94 
 Keep on 
  
 Chat room geeks critique my B-Boy physique 
 Who the fuck made you Hip Hop police? 
 Keep on 
  
 Journalist who never had their turn at this 
 If it's fresh, who are you to determine this, groupie? 
 Keep on 
  
 You here to show truth or expose your cooch? 
 You know I know reek from the roots 
 Girl, keep on 
  
 Disease man made to reproduce, we afraid 
 A cure, magic got AIDS 
 Keep on 
  
 Supporting two homes paying back school loans 
 Like the NBA I’m in a new zone 
 Keep on 
  
 Got married and you carry the weight it take to not get your freak on 
 Keep on 
  
 Fuck shrooms and ecstasy 
 I’m consumed with a recipe 
 To get my blood to the highest destiny 
 Keep on 
  
 The blackest of rappers, I ain’t doing no namin' 
 Go to Europe and start O’Jayin' 
 Keep on 
  
 Whether chopping the raw or studying for the bar 
 We all children of Allah 
 Keep on 
  
 Flyer say Free Mumia on my freezer 
 I’m holding still mixing Echinacea and Golden Seal 
 Keep on 
  
 Is it just an illusion? 
 It’s many levels to it 
 It’s rebel music 
 So keep on[Common's answering machine beeps] 
 Say, brother... 
 If you ever let me leave out a club with a big fat-ass, stove-like bitch like that without pointin' out the facts... 
 I'mma kick your motherfuckin' ass! Man, that nerve of the ho not to give me no pussy... Come up in my house trying to watch movies and shit... this ain't no motherfuckin' cinema, bitch! Who the fuck she thought I -- 
 Say, brother, I wasted a evening. I shoulda went with you. But, oh, well. You know I gets my pussy anyway. You know that's how players do. But God-damnit, Rashid, that big-ass bitch-- *laughs* 
 If you'd have said to spread on that ho, man, I could kick my own ass 
 Well, should go to work... Just another wasted night 
 And ohhhh, ohhhh... Heyyy, heyyy... What can you say?[Verse 1: Common] 
 Let's do it now, it's me and you 
 Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you 
 Listen to me wishin' I could be with you 
 To share my love and ecstasy with you 
 Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep? 
 Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep 
 For you, my love is immortal deep 
 You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak 
 Let's let our bodies talk, and our auras speak 
 Hold on, gotta get the toiletries 
 As our waters reach distances unheard of 
 I'm in the room nestled sweet and I reserve love 
 Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth 
 What He showed me was you 
 Wherever I go, my soul leads to you 
 Days gone, nights lonely for you 
  
 [Hook: Bilal & Prince] 
 Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind 
 Erotica, can I come in your mind? 
 Erotica, P.S., with love I shine

 [Verse 2: Common] 
 So much I wish you were here with me now 
 My bad, I just hit redial 
 I want you to come, and never leave now 
 Is your mind and your right hand free now? 
 Our love-reach deep down inside of it 
 As the candle burns, when desire's lit 
 Makin' love knows no distance or environment 
 When we (ahh!) I feel the most high in it 
 I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it 
 Your love is stuck in me 
 Our minds are so alive and thick 
 Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face 
 Your mouth half open, your love I can taste 
 Embracin' you, life I let go 
 Gotta switch phones, cause this one is ghetto 
 Another level of love we create when we take it to 
 And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you 
  
 [Hook: Prince & Bilal] 
 Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind

 Slave to your loneliness (slave to your loneliness) 
 Inside of loneliness (inside this alt we bear) 
 With love of loneliness (with thoughts of loneliness) 
 Enslaved by loneliness (oh oh) 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 I want you to come, inside your mind 
 And find a place, nasty and kind 
 This is where, our desires grind 
 And where they peak, is most divine 
 A place and time, I hope we reach together 
 You are my queen, and freak forever 
 I feel you in-side my stomach 
 My body shakes (ahhh)

 What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there? 
 Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood 
 And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out 
 So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top 
 What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world 
 What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star 
 And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car 
 Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go school” 
 But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey y'all I'm going to rap” 
 So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back 
 Now his mama she would say to him, “You need to get get back in school” 
 And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using that for fuel 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on 
 They say, “Hey boy, you rap real good, but you ain't making no hit songs” 
 So he'd tell him self, "Yo yo yo, self, you gotta do it the way you do 
 And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new" 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Then the game it started to change, they say music, it ain't the same 
 Though he remained, the song he sang is, "Keep your drive stay in your lane" 
 Inch by inch the people came, they started to know his name and say, "Do your thang" 
 Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star is born 
  
 [Hook][Intro: Black Thought] 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch 
 And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me 
 Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me 
 But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song 
 The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone 
 But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket 
 This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down 
 Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around 
 Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out 
 No telling who had the place scoped out 
 Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know 
 I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with them all 
 If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them 
 And they better not be rocking no new Iversons 
 Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow 
 If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know 
 Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party 
 Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body 
 What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib? 
 They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe 
 But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards 
 It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it 
 'Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it 
 The blunt and dirty disses is my only exhibit 
 Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface 
 Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless 
  
 [Outro: Black Thought] 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Wherever you are, whoever you are 
 Check it out 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are 
 Wherever you are, whoever you are 
 Check it out, yeah[Instrumental] 
  
 [Outro: woman speaking] 
 He was a big guy from Tyler, Texas... and... uh I think we walked in the class one day and we passed each other... and he was country, country so he was like... "Heyyy lil mama"... and I giggled... I was like, "Heyyyyy""Like they used to say" *repeated in background* 
  
 [Common] 
 We dealin wit some very critical and crucial times 
 Some of the most critical and crucial times I've ever seen 
 I was on Stoney Island with my guy 
 He was tryin to tell me about the S-I-E experience 
 Tried to tell him about the C-S-E experience, you know? 
  
 Yo I'm the rap profession, I go the session 
 Study MC's like a god do lessons 
 Mic testin in the rain, I brainstorm 
 You feelin me out nigga? We got the same form 
 I drop heavy in spots you scared to put your weight 
 There's only so much ice you can skate on 
 Shit cats write for you, you say wrong 
 No time to debate on, who's your pop and who's not 
 Or who shot Big and 2Pac 
 Or who this stud fuckin or how much this crew got 
 That's ho shit 
 That ain't me or the type of niggas I roll wit 
 I Cold Get Dumb, like a brother in prison 
 Who hasn't had a chance to hold his son 
 Sacrificin like Abe did his oldest son 
 Tryin to hold my come, I think of raps 
 Seen the BDP cover and I start thinkin back to 
  
 * "Silly Hoes" sample* say what? "Like they used to say" 
 "Kool G Rap and Polo, back again" [Kool G Rap] 
 Yeah "Like they used to say" 
 * "Ain't No Half-Steppin" sample* yeah "Like they used to say" 
 (Dig it, like they used to say) *Biz Markie sample* "Like they used to say" 
  
 [Common] 
 I walk through triple darkness wit a childproof lighter 
 All your homeboys are biters, so what's up wit that? 
 Your producer pumped the track 
 Told him, "Naw, I can't fuck wit that" 
 Nice way of sayin "Big, bring a rougher track" 
 My boy in my ear said "Enough of that humble rap" 
 Now every single you drop I'mma double that 
 Jigga-jigga Joe cut the record down to 
 My sound surround you like racism, you feel it all around you 
 I go into a soundproof booth and change flows

 Google+, all of that, this is what it is, it don't stop 
 Common let's go, my brother 
  
 [Common] 
 Yo, ashtrays and cigarettes, last days indigenous people 
 These are adventures of young black millionaires 
 I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged 
 The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this 
 On the move like black slaves through the wilderness 
 I write it and still get invited to white Christmases 
 When I was young 3 wise men came to visit us 
 One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner 
 They cracked the bottle, and then start giving gifts 
 "You from Chicago - we want you to deliver this" 
 Show the walking dead who the true and living is 
 Separate the fake from who the real niggas is 
 Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris 
 Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis 
 Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings 
 I guess it's my addiction to women, ah! 
 I was in France, Hennessey blending 
 Writing my own rhymes like I'm Tennessee Williams 
 Now I'm right here with the brother named Flex 
 Y'all know the context, Com'll get sex 
 He talk about the ladies and yo yo, you see me um 
 He said we got them broads, yo yo they premium 
 That's how it is yo getting into the biz 
 You know Com Sense always said what it is, so yo 
 You should know I'm coming down, you should see a 
 Brother Com Sense with the album "The Dreamer, The Believer" 
 It's like that y'all, right here Hot 97, in Flex We Trust[Common - Intro] 
 Shout outs to J Dilla 
 Just Blaze... 
 It's love...Common... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I never knew a love, love, a love like this 
 It's sorta like the love that's played in tennis 
 Limitless, when intimate friends express it 
 I talked to the Most, and I know he blessed it 
 The cadence of destiny, patience, and ecstasy 
 We can be fresh on the cover of Ebony 
 But this is somethin' special we ain't tryna exploit 
 With a couple actresses, now I'm in the tabloids 
 Like bad boys, real love moves in silence 
 About out bih'ness, family bih'ness stay private 
 Don't sweat the small stuff girl, cause we both giants 
 I looked into your eye's and I see divine vibrance 
 The way that Prince, Minnie Rip' and Joni Mitch' described it 
 A beautiful package, what's even better is inside it 
 Alive with the feelings that I'm feelin' with you 
 Forever became real, but even realer' with you - it's love 
  
 [Hook: Marsha Ambrosius] 
 It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile 
 Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me 
 Cause you are the light, that shines 
 And I want the world to see, that you are the light 
 That shines, you are my life 
 Love... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's important we communicate 
 And watch this relationship illuminate the world 
 Black pearl in you is a lover and friend 
 Picture how your name will sound with the last name Lynn 
 Put a prayer in the air, that it never'll end 
 And if so, when we come back, it'll be better again 
 I will be by your side through the smile & laughs 
 The child we have, even when the clouds is bad 
 I know your heart had been broken by a love that pass 
 And when you're not lookin', that's when love can grab 
 Sometimes you gotta ask, "Are we movin' too fast?" 
 Ain't no limit to a love, that's given from above 
 Mean fish, collard greens, corn bread, you be rockin' it 
 Similar values, though in many ways we opposite 
 Attracted to your 'uh', and the way that you be poppin' it 
 Brighten my life reminded me to stay positive - it's love 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile 
 Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me 
 Cause you are the light, that shines 
 And I want the world to see, that you are the light 
 That shines, you are my life 
 Love... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 Pop, rock, and Green Day, respectin' what the King say 
 For me to give a ring, hey, only a queen may 
 Invites to loved ones, imagine a dream day 
 Walkin' down the aisles sayin' vows, us eternal 
 Til thus do us, for now, we stay fertile 
 Chicka-uh, Chicka-uh, Chicka-Chicka-ta uh 
 Let's keep creatin' baby, what we makin' is love 
  
 [Bridge: Bilal] 
 Love is like a melody 
 Looked into her eyes and see 
 A night that shines as bright as day 
 All my troubles drift away 
 The light, the light, the light 
 (Looked into her eyes and see) 
 The light, the light, the li-hi-hi-light 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile 
 Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me 
 Cause you are the light, that shines 
 And I want the world to see, that you are the light 
 That shines, you are my life 
 Love... 
  
 {Marsha Ambrosius harmonizes as "Once again, it's the light!" is scratched} 
  
 [Just Blaze] 
 You have somebody...don't be embarrassed, don't be afraid 
 Put 'em close, let em know... 
 You might not get another chance, trust! 
  
 (There is a light, that shines...oh who-whoa...)[Sway]

 Gas pedals, put the gas to the pedal

 And even in the gas pedal, rolling in the Hyundai 
 I went down the street that was one-way 
  
 [Sway]

 The favourite girl I ever banged was hip-hop, aah! 
 I do it political like I'm the president 
 Yo, it's like that, it's so evidentCheck it 
 We can go, toe to toe, with the blows to the temple (NOT) 
 Not the Temple of Doom, so make room 
 For the Unamerican Caravan (who you down with?) 
 The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some 
 I don't get rid of some faces 
 While marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases 
 They have too many cases, and now they got courage 
 Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge 
 But I got, the story straight 
 Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep 
 Slept and got, crept 
 An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount 
 Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out 
 (BOOM) A blackout, power failure 
 I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows 
 Uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggas 
 Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker 
 And I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston 
 I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin 
 Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast! 
 I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS 
 And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills 
 YOU MUST be poppin pills, tryin to step to me 
 Cause to the left of me, WE got the U-A-C (whattup) 
 And comin up to the right of me, WE got the U-A-C (come on) 
 And in back of me, yo WE got the U-A-C 
 And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G! 
 We hit em hard!

 Kick it 
 A duck tried to buck, but the vic got vicked 
 So I picked him, he's another victim of a circumstance 
 He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?) 
 But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C 
 Ya see, I ain't out here, tryin to be a bully 
 Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie 
 (WORD IS BOND) that I got big balls homes 
 And if a player try to press me, I gotta break the zone 
 Here to stage a, OOH SHIT, up in the sky 
 You better watch out, I'm tellin you why 
 Common Sense is breaking, marks down, ah-follow-me-now 
 Yo Common Sense is breaking, marks down

 Homeskillet, WHERE YA BEEN? Are you the boy in the plastic bubble? 
 Ooh you in trouble!

 You end up on a stretched cause I stretch you like Plastikman 
 Fuck with me ("you end up the in the cas-ket") 
 You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard 
 (Yo Common calm down, you gots to calm down!) 
 This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down 
 Lesson number one - when you're ready to throw 
 Never step up talkin - that's like tryin to pitch, but you're balkin 
 And I'mma steal first, not the base, but your face 
 You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE 
 In case of emergency, it's urgent see, that you see a doctor 
 You tried to Gamble, but I'm the Proctor 
 I knock that ass, bringin it down and then slash 
 Tried to play me with a skit, but now you got a gash 
 You character, for ya inherit a, neck brace 
 Makin ya thousand deaths times worser than a Screwface 
 But they call me Screwneck and I do wreck shit 
 So next time he push up in the jam, BOY YOU BETTER EXIT

 But then we runnin to a scrub that tried to bug 
 He's out to get some what they call em stunts because we bunt 
 (WHAT?) But I don't bug, I just slide her, and hit her 
 Some be rumpy chump, with the chat chat chitter 
 Yo we did her but I betcha know I'm better on it 
 Now you got a 100 percent beef, it's just a beatdown 
 (UH UH AHH!) Too late to try to be down 
 Brother your best bet, is to cover your eyes, like Dee Brown 
 (Cause it's a bum bum bum, bum-rush) 
 And if I ask who popped shit, the Caravan gotta bus 
 Sing it ("on that defense") 
 But our bumrush is well done, not medium rare 
 It's rare to see, an enemy within play 
 True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say 
 Me say, Warriors come out and play 
 And I'mma tear shit up and leave it like the day, after 
 And after we go around, and you hit the ground 
 Then you know I'm down with the Blows to the Temple 
  
 * shout outs *The rhyme I pick up, trick up, and like hiccup

 So throw your hands in the air and say hell yeah 
 I Can Beat Mike Tyson, plus I'm Fresh-er than the Prince of Bel Air 
 And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see 
 Some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma 
 Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winnin a contest 
 I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress 
 I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig 
 I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig 
 The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smokin blunts 
 Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood 
 They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects 
 Rockin a Rolex, preferrin sex instead of Soloflex 
 But I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good 
 The baddest hoes be sayin, "Oooh you're real good" 
 Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella 
 Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller 
 Nail a flammer with the Hammer for comin incorrect 
 Not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner 
 So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me 
 Kid just in the nick I kick more ass than Bruce Lee's Nike's did

 To be dissin it's a, Rainbow Coalition 
 I'm kissin ass, goodbye, rockaby, here's your lullaby 
 Like Georgie Puddin Pie but baby baby don't, cry 
 Feed em I heat em and eat em if I don't need em then I leave em 
 As leftovers, packin the weak MC's into ?septober? 
 Til I was older, I couldn't hold a rhyme folder 
 Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder 
 If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk 
 I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be sayin I'm a hunk 
 Like a duck I'm slammin ham MC's MC's I'm servin 
 Makin the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!! 
 Those deserving props are gonna get theirs 
 Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs 
 I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape 
 Tryin to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate 
 For air you're gaspin, your best bet is to take an aspirin

 Tonight's musical guest 
 Two of Chicago's Finest emcees! 
 Give it up for Common and Kanye West! 
  
 "It's Common Sense!" 
  
 [Intro - Common] 
 Yeah! "Common Sense!" - {*scratched*} 
 It's Common Sense! With Kanye West! 
 On the Dave Chappelle Show! 
 Everybody gotta eat right? 
 It's the food baby! 
  
 [Chorus - Kanye West] 
 I walked in the crib, got two kids 
 And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!) 
 So I had to did, what I had to did 
 Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!) 
 I'm up all night, getting my money right 
 Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!) 
 Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know 
 Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!) 
  
 [Verse - Common] 
 You love to hear the story, again and again 
 About these young brothers, from the City of Wind 
 Like juice and gin, in the city we blend 
 Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims 
 Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed 
 Heartless females that wanna ride in em 
 Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim 
 Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims 
 We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting 
 On the block white is selling like Eminem 
 On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them 
 On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then 
 Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling 
 Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them 
 Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him 
 He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Verse - Common] 
 It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems 
 Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims 
 Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts 
 We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's 
 Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for 
 Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe 
 Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe 
 Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go 
 Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto 
 Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind 
 Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up 
 Clench my fists tight, holding the right up 
 Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter 
 Situations, and jobs get tighter 
 My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon! 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Bridge - Kanye West] 
 I - I know I could make it right 
 If I could just swallow my pride 
 But I can't run away or put my - away 
 You can't front on me 
 I - no I can't let it ride 
 No no not tonight 
 See I can't run away or put my - away 
 You can't front on me 
  
 [*applause*]With my guy in the Box Chevy 
 He got a job, used to move rock steady 
 Windows shaking when the bass drop heavy 
 Nigga driving like he the black Tom Petty 
 All fast, extra tint on the glass 
 Way past the limit when we was past the (?) 
 (Woop-woop) We heard sirens 
 Swear I never liked police better than the firemen 
 Here they come harassing us, off the GP 
 Maybe cause the car looking like a teepee 
 Easy easy easy, they approached us 
 Hand by their holsters, close to their toasters 
 Us against them man, that's the culture 
 Try to look sober before they get close to 
 The window, hoping that the wind blow the smell away 
 Been through hell today, don't need a felony 
 Asking my guy for his license 
 Damn fam, you ain't got a license? 
 At least for the weed he got a license 
 They shining the light right through my iris 
 Got us out the car, put us on the curb 
 Going through the car looking for the herb 
 Must've found something because he acting all awry 
 Found a pound stashed in the laundry 
 Then they started asking whose was it 
 Split us up so they can ask more questions 
 Am I the buyer? Am I the supplier? 
 Am I rich? Do I have any buyers? 
 Once they realized that they couldn't move an inch us 
 That's when they divide and try to Willie Lynch us 
 Said that my guy said it was my shit 
 Oh I'mma fall for that (?) shit? 
 C'mon man I'm from a Chi environment 
 Exercise my right to stay silent 
 Smoking Bob Marley but I ain't gonna wail out 
 Or sing to the cops man, no sell out[Immens] Yo man.. I'm hungry man 
 [Common] Ay whatchu want man? You want some breakfast or somethin?

 Drop the loop, then a scooper hoop ya like a hula 
 To school a fool or be sent a church to repent

 I'm all that jazz, and I kick, kick, kick, kick.. 
  
 [Common] 
 The razzamatazz oh please oh please just give me just one more blast 
 I +Gett Off+ like Prince, but I don't have to show my ass 
 Pass the rest, like a test, if you slip then you'll get ripped 
 With your handicapped pass rap, and Tales From the Crypt 
 I whip on that ass like base ba-bay 
 The Sense is good-GOOBELY-goo, ask Grady 
  
 [Immenslope] 
 Or Lamont, or Rollo, down at the, Apollo 
 Come follow me now (BO! Where's Sue?) I don't know 
 Even En Vogue, be tellin me ya don't go 
 When it's time for show (yea) everyone says 
 Ho (ho) ho (ho) couldn't be a slider 
 'Cause I never slip, kick it like a Damme Van flip 
 So don't come with your judo, cause you're just a Menudo 
 Emcee gettin chewed like vegetables 
  
 [Common] 
 Ahhhhh cabbage is a cabbage, a lettuce is a lettuce 
 I'mma tear this whole joint into scraps 
 I bust raps, perhaps caps, and trap the wack tracks 
 Givin the max, for the minimum, not the minimum for the max 
 Get more sex than Wilt the Stilt so you can call me the Stiltest 
 You're takin shorts like Arnold, so what chu talkin bout, Willis?

 [Immenslope] 
 To keep the hot raw, I'm rollin, rollin 
 Bowlin - spare me! Fuss ya hushed mouth mush 
 Lush alcohol's excessive like a Jefferson 
 Movin on up -- progressive 
 One time for your brain, cell 
 And when I get through, you say -- aww hell man! 
 Styles that I free won't, stop til the end 
 Paper I go on and go on with the pen 
 Get a max of funk, attack or sunk *huff, huff* 
 One blow, and emcees are gone with the wind 
 Kickin the dumber rhyme, I'm not a prince 
 But I'm fresh, heatin up like the summertime, summer rhyme 
 I'm a dime a dozen, but I keep you buzzin 
 Like a bee, a dozen attempts is in the toilet 
 'Cause I flush the dime and I'm not a Leader 
 'Cause I Busta Rhyme, a rhyme 
 If I kick with Rakim, you run for cover brother 
 But I kick it with Petey cause I'm just another mother (sucker) 
 Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time) 
 It's Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time) 
 In the mix, the dimension, J.B., and Chico 
 It's seven, not six, my shirt extra-large 
 But I wear, I wear, I wear it well like DeBarge 
 To the finish, makin ya eye pop, like you ain't spinach 
 Then it's, time to let you know 
 We count it up, one two three and fo'

 [C] Nah we gon' count it down

 [Common] 
 Around and round and upside down and upside down we go 
 WHOAHHHHH! I'mma sneak in the front row 
 Not Jethro, I'm not a Jethro, on skid row 
 I don't wear Monie's hat, but I was a Monkey +in the Middle+ 
 Hey diddle diddle, you can Kibble a Bit 
 I take a squat, and booty MC's be sayin OOOOHHH SHIT! 
 Yo, I turn Bucktown into Fucktown 
 You're just a field goal kid, and I'm a touchdown 
 With the next point to the next joint, so tell Spike about it 
 I'm all that, that your bitch be writin home about it 
 Shout it out, praise the Lord, hallelujah! 
 This could be love, but umm, don't let em fool ya 
 'Cause when I do ya, come down, come down after me come 
 Yeah sorry Sugar Plums but umm, I gotta run 
 Run Jesse Run, keep hope alive 
 I'm down with the B-boys, FUCK the Jackson 5 
 You jive-ass turkey, a-pit-apitta-a-aperk be 
 You can get ill, but don't, HURT ME, HURT ME 
 Or irk me, cause see I'll outsmart you like the Urkel 
 B-boys at the school of hard knocks, in a circle 
 Pass the sess blunt, yeah stud, you ain't know? 
 I wanna go bang, I said, bang-o, bang-oh bang-oh 
 Or bojangle, jingle jangle, run the jewel 
 Hip-hip, hooray, oh now you wanna be a Luvabull? 
 Don't push or pull, or you'll see, I'mma wreck it out 
 MC's be checkin in but they don't be checkin out 
 I leave em out on the canvas 
 So click your heels twice and take your ass back to KANSAS..[Intro] 
 Come on, let's get started.  Don't listen to that street talk.  That street talk is dead.  Don't be talking about no drugs and no popped Uzis around here.  If you ain't got no basketball in your hand and wanna shoot it out, you gotta go somewhere else 
  
 [Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2) 
 I don't expect you to be something you're not 
 All I expect you to give is all you got 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Yo, yo, check it 
 Unattached and calm, sundaes and pills I palm 
 With intentions to make it to the league 
 Intrigued by two-letter cars, SE's and GS'ses 
 On the court, niggas I leave like messages 
 Plagued by this ball-player exorcist 
 It's sort of foul how the world be reffin' us 
 Kenny is our Moses in this five-on-five Exodus 
 For the game of life, full courts ain't preppin' us 
 Schools want me, but the ghost of Manigault haunts me 
 Plus they wanna crib me, way out in the country 
 I'm city like street lights and some games that be fights 
 Never worked on my left so it's hard to be right 
 Either rich, poor, or Mike is who I wanna be like 
 Story of many black males that I refuse to rewrite 
  
 [Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2) 
 I don't expect you to be something you're not 
 All I expect you to give is all you got 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len 
 That I'll end up like Ben... Wilson—still, some pretend to be friends 
 Beneath the grin, I see the jinn spoke of in the Surah 
 More so than my soul, my jumper is purer 
 People play juror.  I witness the fall of legends 
 Once was the joint—now they resin.  Got a God-given present 
 My gallant talent is like a magic 
 Trick turned by a chick with a bad habit 
 Opportunity to move, I grab it 
 Me and my moms had static.  Now I reek Hennessy and havoc 
 Man to man talks with Kenny send me to a zone 
 Been on my own for so long, my vocal tone's grown 
 Competition gets blown like speakers 
 When I cross her like Jesus out of bleachers, broads, and beepers 
 Yeah I boogey it's all good, but it could be better 
 Want to stay eighteen forever 
 But now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland 
 If Brooklyn courts was a campus, then I would be the big man 
  
 [Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2) 
 I don't expect you to be something you're not 
 All I expect you to give is all you got 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 From thoughts that pennies bring, I assemble teams like the Kenny Kings 
 Think fast over breaks, dialect I'm dribbling 
 Remembering night posters of Moses and the Supreme Court 
 Realizing that rap and life are team sports 
 I follow these thoughts 
 Moves never receive thought, lyrical Johnny Cochran 
 Cause of the way I free thought 
 The system make a nigga think to make it that he need sports 
 Or either to the tip he gotta resort 
 My seed'll be taught to start his own in the George Carter zone 
 Don't wanna be a dope MC living in his momma's home 
 Or speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone 
 Unknown zones I roam with mind architecture 
 Spark the lecture, emphasizing: let God direct ya 
  
 [Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x4) 
 I don't expect you to be something you're not 
 All I expect you to give is all you got[Intro: OmarLye-Fook] 
 Na-na-na na na na na 
 Ohhhh 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 My eyes watch God from a place, where times is hard 
 Hard times we embrace, everybody want a yard 
 Cause a yard means space 
 Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste 
 In the mouth of the metropolitan, the hustle is hollerin' 
 Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollar and 
 Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin' 
 We all taught hustle to profit like Solomon 
 The young play corners, Sean John modelin' 
 They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin' 
 Blue and whites flash lights like parliment 
 In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan 
 Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again 
 Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains 
 My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin' 
 Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle 
  
 [Hook: Common & OmarLye-Fook] 
 Just put it in your back and hustle 
 The paper's stacked so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Just move and shake and grind and hustle 
 It's on your mind so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
  
 [Verse 2: Dart Chillz] 
 First to the third, I'm close to the curb 
 Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve 
 Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor 
 Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves 
 It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy 
 To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toy 
 So he can come, so just work, murder rate is increasin' 
 I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent 
 And my rims blind the whole damn precinct 
 Everytime you see a head in my lap, you know she sinked 
 I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think 
 Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink 
 Five went through me, two stayed in me 
 To do my duty, only thing that subdued me 
 Two weeks, same corner, new freaks 
 New geese, all white, AND1 new sneaks 
  
 [Hook: Common & OmarLye-Fook] 
 Just put it in your back and hustle 
 The paper's stacked so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Just move and shake and grind and hustle 
 It's on your mind so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that 
  
 [Bridge] 
 "Can't knock the hustle, the hustle" 
 "I'm in, I'm in, I'm in too deep, deep to sleep!" 
 "Can't knock the hustle, the hustle" 
 "Caught up in the hustle" ("I'm gettin' high") 
 "Can't knock the hustle, the hustle!" 
 "I'm in, I'm in, I'm in too deep, deep to sleep!" 
 "Can't knock the hustle, the hustle" 
 "Gotta hustle up" ("I got to have it, have it, have it") 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sew clothes 
 Some hobo at the junction in between cars 
 Some enter the functions in between stars 
 Some teach, some preach saying they seen God 
 Some put they money up, against mean odds 
 Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds 
 Dreams of rollin Eldorados bumpin' El DeBarge 
 Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours 
 It's the hustle 
  
 [Hook: Common & OmarLye-Fook] 
 Just put it in your back and hustle 
 The paper's stacked so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that

 It's on your mind so hustle 
 Gon', gon' get it, get me that

 "Gotta hustle up!" 
 "Stay hustlin'!" 
 "Gotta hustle up!" 
 "Stay hustlin'!"

 "Gotta hus-, hustle up!" 
 "Stay hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'!"[Intro: Common] 
 You! Yeah 
 The war is on, who you fighting for? 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 It's like funk to rhythm and punk to rock 
 Loud like shot that come from a Glock 
 Pick up your mind, run from the spot 
 Revolution jumping in the parking lot 
 Shit is so hot, that the sun watch 
 Children by the window with the gun cocked 
 They cooking the raw to start to lump knots 
 Monkeys dance around for MTV spots 
 I lock into a- (scratches) 
 Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom 
 Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system 
 For the humble on the path, I paint a vision 
 How far will a nigga go just for attention 
 And to be remembered? You forgot the mission 
 Listen! 
  
 [Hook: Laetitia Sadier & Common] 
 All traces of life, in our guts we carry 
 That's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!) 
 All things I yearn for, you need per sanity 
 That reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!) 
 Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be 
 The times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!) 
 This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous 
 Before it likely ever ends (come on, come on!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera 
 For the people to make or wait is better 
 In a room called real, I stay forever 
 Everyday I lose something, I gain forever 
 Meditate on how I can change the weather 
 My brainstorm for some is like planes, umbrella 
 Where bullets and lies both spray together 
 My mind scream like Al Green "Let's Stay Together" 
 How could a nigga be so scared of change? 
 That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange 
 Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game 
 Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name 
 You seen what happened when the Com go bang 
 Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range 
 Seen hype become fame against the grain become main 
 Stream, it all seems mundane in the scope of thangs 
  
 [Hook: Laetitia Sadier & Common] 
 All traces of life, in our guts we carry 
 That's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!) 
 All things I yearn for, you need per sanity 
 That reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!) 
 Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be 
 The times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!) 
 This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous 
 Before it likely ever ends (come on, come on!) 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 From a land of shit talk, porn stars and pitchforks 
 Didn't really see white until I went North 
 Getting bent off in backyards 
 Wishing in the air for a black god 
 Where the people fix cars and clap hard 
 And look to the stars for rap jobs 
 I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots 
 Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops 
 That master anger, it ain't afraid to shoot 
 Through poured liquor, fallen angels they salute 
 (Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow 
 A new wave, people with they hair trimmed low 
 It's two ways living in this world of techno 
 This new age can't really save the ghetto 
 I pause for the rebels, who rock heavy metals 
 And tell them that they pharaoh so let go 
 Come on!

 [Outro: Common] 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Come on![Instrumental]This is a U-A rhyme, dedicate to the ca-nine 
 Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time 
 It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie 
 I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me 
 I don't pretend to be the open door roses type 
 I open the door for myself, and I close it right 
 In your face, now you wanna taste my food, what? 
 You got your own food, get a attitude 
 You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul 
 I ain't tryin to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile 
 Cause after awhile, I'mma wanna get BUCKwild 
 And now months laters, I'mma say it ain't my child 
 I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin 
 Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin 
 Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces 
 Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces 
 That's how I'm livin, just like a rottweiler 
 When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder 
 But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem 
 And when I can't bear em, I share em 
 You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss 
 I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH 
 So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul 
 Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball 
 Brrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin upon the nitty gritty 
 I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY 
  
 .. 
  
 Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day 
 Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way 
 I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper 
 Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker 
 So come one friend, come two friend, come all 
 United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall 
 In your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very 
 Thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry 
 Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker 
 You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker 
 Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum 
 I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb 
 If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game 
 Then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame 
 I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally 
 Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately 
 Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut 
 And be that I'm a mutt -- so what? 
 No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to 
 It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin 
 Down the street, watchin ladies 
 Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby 
 I ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother 
 Word to mommy dearest, I look farther 
 Down the road, to a road not taken 
 I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care 
 A new flower, so Joe can take a shower 
 And get wet, and then jet 
 Like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven 
 I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven 
 Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear 
 "Is Common there?" Uh-uh, sorry 
 You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack 
 Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back 
 It's like that and it'll be like that 
 Because a dog is a woman's best friend black[Intro: Sonny Sondoval & Common]

 Blood and magic dripping from me 
 True thugs and addicts, I grip an entry 
 Enter this game with tricks and envy 
 I forget game to remain an MC 
 Rooms in this mind that's still empty 
 Only fufilled through prophecy 
 You stoppin me, you see I'm tryna catch this plane 
 You must be throwed nigga, catch your brain 
 It's fresh, but it is some stress in fame 
 Got hoes? Ho nigga, respect the game 
 I talked to cab drivers about the fast lane 
 And Islam, masters and chakras and beyond 
 Think about the hustle and somehow I see by 
 Wrote a letter to the concrete, P.S. we strong

 Mercury in retrograde 
 I'm tryna get niggas in the ghetto paid 
 While they watch pornos and Escalades 
 Away from floats and the dope in sex parades 
 Somebody screamin in my mind, I'm tryna find if it's me 
 Or voices from the master they designed to be free 
 Same revolt, can't be found on TV 
 Or radio, it's livin in me 
 Hey lady, that smoke is bothering me 
 If I put it in your eye, ashes you would cry 
 All this rap talk is blowing my high 
 I just came to chill and build with my guy 
 I try to walk but I stumble off the humble path 
 This story of a pimp stick that became a staff

 Out of body experience, hard to explain 
 Like the pyramids and gods, I remain 
 I know pain, like Kurt Cobain 
 Or A.I. playin, hurt the whole game 
 Digging to the Earth's brain for worst gain 
 Focused like young blood on his first chain 
 I used to write shit, to please niggas 
 Now I write shit, to freeze niggas 
 Whether iced out or American pie sliced out 
 I sit in the room with the lights out 
 Whether diced out, or with their hair spiked out 
 I sit alone in the room with the lights out screaming

 Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with a attitude 
 Pass the booze and let's build on it 
 I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted 
 I ain't even smoke no bo but I feel blunted 
 Yo I'm toking on the freedom, stepping to the AM 
 Cats is toting in the BM, tell them players I'm the GM 
 Told my team let me get my plays straight and I'ma feed them 
 They need me like I need them, you see the streets is bleeding 
 Had a meeting with my mind on how I can be divine and 
 Stay on my grind 
 I'm grinding until I get blue balls 
 Every day, same shit, new stall 
 Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal 
 It's a place that you run from if you neutral 
 Hustlers in Volks, customers and smoke 
 I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

 I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go to a thrift shop 
 Bring that get up to the ghetto and get props 
 If you gon' get that kick-a-box, make sure that bitch knock 
 If you gon' get that Glock, don't be scared to lick shot 
 Hip-hop is changing, y'all want me to stay the same? 
 Sort of like Barkley on how I see the game 
 I recognize game like a scout 
 Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out 
 I ain't about that, messing with no other man's woman 
 Because of jealousy, then a man go under 
 Understand, a man and his mental 
 Listening to Joan Mitchell with the fan in the window 
 Can it be so simple then? 
 I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands 
 I want a Rover but I'm thinking long range 
 I ain't switched over, I just made my own lane

 Like a pimp to a hoe, I connect to the track 
 I feel it in my neck, and my back 
 A thug came to me, said it changed his life 
 Said the love of his life, he used to bang to "The Light" 
 I'm trying to do better, I ain't claiming Mr. Right 
 I'm a grown man, too old to fist-fight 
 Stay on point like trick dice 
 You tweaking like a sound man you need to switch mics 
 Soundin' bitch like, I know the block is hot but we just can't get ice 
 Want our children's children to sit nice 
 I sing the song to make the fiend's strong 
 King Kong ain't got shit on me 
 I train days to rip emcees 
 I'm vegan but I still gotta get that cheese

 Get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes 
 Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde

 I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set 
 Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency 
 Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce 
 Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce 
 Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+

 Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal 
 With the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle 
 Get zapped and zipped in the duffle 
 Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist 
 To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this! 
 A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him 
 But yo she pinching my ass so we go, limb for limb 
 Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight 
 So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one! 
  
 [Hook: All] 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Underground under pressure, my style is the child 
 Of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad 
 Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge 
 Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj 
 I take over breaks and chop loops 
 Glorifying, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops 
 Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose 
 Dating game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Posdnuos 
 Before you get a style, let's get a style 
 My style pans the crowd back and forth 
 You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit 
 You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough 
 And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern 
 Emcee, familiar sample period; spotting where you sampled 
 Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it 
 I drop science and experiment -- contractually 
 Came to terms of endearment with my label 
 Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggas, I contact niggas 
 Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows 
 Wiping your nose like you need blows 
 Claiming it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats 
 Or is it how they word it 
 If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with 
 Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted 
 Many lip profess, I'm verb centered 
  
 [Hook: All] 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
  
 [Verse 3: Pos] 
 It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip 
 Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength 
 I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid 
 Of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid' 
 Infinite landscaper, green paper maker 
 Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims 
 Man these people still taking rappin for a joke 
 The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent 
 Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide 
 On the mic exposing your polluted bloodtype 
 Y'all niggas need a visit from the Brain Fairy 
 Walk around dead, like your physical's buried 
 Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's 
 Shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit 
 That yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless 
 My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless 
 Your crew couldn't even measure to mine 
 That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine 
 Performing with an upper design, so back on off the plank 
 We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank 
  
 [Hook: All] 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down!!! 
 "Just get on down.." 
  
 * cut and scratch of "Just get on down.." to the song's end *[Hook] 
 In-inhale, in-inhale 
 In-inhale, in-inhale 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I breathe deep like an old man in a deep sleep 
 Or Indian peace pipe in a tepee 
 The beginning, the end; the first, the last 
 Breath into eternity the verse will last 
 Got a chick in the south that be cursing fast 
 When it was a drought, I knew the thirst would last 
 Hunger of a homeless, microphoners 
 Played the game and got a bonus, man cause the plan is 
 To master like Tiger, so much drive 
 I am the definition of a rider 
 Daughter's name means 'survivor', from a tribe of 
 Colliders, just one word can't describe her 
 A scribe of the streets, and a good life that we all want to reach 
 I'm hotter than a beach 
 Flow is so deep, even underwater 
 I can inhale to put the world in order 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Gasping for air, and everlast 
 Still raps that are rare, I write with Christ 
 Passion to stair-way to Heaven is to stay in step 
 Breath is deep like my man Johnny Depp 
 You never know the next one God could have kept 
 So I find it hard to accept 
 I came from a gang, now I'm a star with a rep 
 Just to get-- by, 'cause I was slept on like a red-eye 
 Like Rastafara, I knew to keep my head high 
 Blessed by the father, son of the author of life 
 So rap became my wife 
 Like love at first sight or [Doug?] in his first fight 
 It's all new, so you got to feel your way through 
 Until you break through, it might take two 
 Inhale deep to inflict too, it's great to 
 Breathe 
  
 [Hook x2][Verse 1: Common] 
 I'm the river that flow through the hood 
 Through the woods, through the 'burbs 
 Through the mud, through the bricks 
 Over the curb, to the forest reserve 
 Got with four acres and a forest of words 
 Plant and grown them, for the young seeds to know them 
 Trees is blowing, we see change in the wind 
 It's a new day and I got to take it in 
 See a black man run, we need him to win 
 Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow 
 That belief lead the way and the angels follow 
 Open doors for the hopeful to go through 
 Cause I was chose to and I'm supposed to 
  
 [Hook x2: Muhsinah] 
 I know that change gon' come 
 The race begun 
 We're almost there, oh yea 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child 
 Always smiled, let my mind float like a child 
 Wishing I was smart as these kids are now 
 All grown up still wishing I'm child, again 
 Church song reminded me to stay grateful 
 Omoye reminded me to stay playful 
 Days go by, my life on high 
 I lead on my wall so the fight don't die 
 In me, I found purpose why I emcee 
 Inspire a young world to be greater than me 
 I fall awake and I dream a song 
 So the little shorties will sing along 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Welcome children, welcome me 
 Your sentiments is felt in me 
 I see the future and the walk you have 
 Don't let these fools take you off your path 
 Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to 
 Life is a trip, ride along and proceed to 
 Drive to believe to do what you want to do 
 Remember your kings and queens are still humble too 
 Life is in front of you, no need to look back again 
 Victory can be claimed while you still battling 
 Travel along with the food I provide you 
 To awaken the voice that's inside you 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Outro: Omoye Assata Lynn] 
 Change is inevitable you can't stop it 
 Change is happening in everybody's life 
 Change is like a furious hurricane that you can't stop 
 What is change? 
 Change is Martin Luther King Jr., 
 Ghandi, Shakespeare, Assata Shakur 
 Barack Obama 
 And you can't forget Common 
 Change is gonna happen 
 Change is hopeHey, Hey old been, and you too baby sweets 
 I'm back in the studio, you know, I drove up 
 In the parking lot, and the parking lot was empty 
 Wasn't no cars out there like nobody wasn't even in here 
 All the doors were locked from the inside 
 But, I found a window cracked on the first floor so now I'm in here 
 Let's rap 
 So, I come in here, talk to my son, you know? 
 But, but, his next album he got comin' out 
 You know it's been such a spiritual feelin' 
 I had to come back in the studio just to see what he was doing 
 Cause I was gettin' those vibes all in the rocky mountains say, "I got to go," 
 You know? I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather 
 And I'm so proud 
 I can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud 
 You know? Son I wanna give you, you know? 
 Any direction in parenting at this stage 
 Because I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me 
 See you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world 
 We're just the physical parents, you know? 
 God loaned you to us, as God's spirit 
 We're the physical parents, you know? 
 Like I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know? 
 But, I know when you started teaching me 
 See we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn 
 I think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know? 
 And I know when you started teaching me too 
 You know, I was hanging out, mad at the world 
 My professional basketball career was over 
 And I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore 
 And I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know? 
 And one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like "What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do? 
 You got the responsibility to teach me the right things 
 You got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety" 
 You know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know? 
 I said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me 
 And I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know? 
 And immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this? 
 I had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you 
 So, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son 
 I'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things 
 Cause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you 
 Cause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street 
 But, you taught me continuous numerous lessons 
 And I love you my son[Common] 
 I'm a Jake, I don't bake a cake 
 I'm not a cake daddy, you know the type be pullin up in a Caddy 
 With a drop top, see when I ho hop, I kick it to the bus stop (what?) 
 And it's goodie goodie gumdrops 
 I don't be droppin squat but to the heads they think it's topnotch 
 I'm skippin over every other dip as if it's 
 Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop, hop, hopscotch, watch 
  
 Aiy aiyyo man, ay man, look at ol' girl 
 She got a BIG ass! (Yo man, sic her.) 
 Aiy man, ay... hey sweetheart, how you doin? 
 I'm doin fine 
 Oh word? What's your name? 
 Rayshel 
 Why don't you come over to the house so I can put you in the 
 BUCK BANG! 
  
 Aight check it, you see I only bag ya for a second 
 You never see me beggin, you see the slimmie naked 
 In my headroom, mo' better yet my bedroom 
 Tippedy tokin, and stutterin as if she's Max Headroom 
 Redroom (Redrum?) No I ain't a murderer 
 I'm Jake the Rake, yo sorry if I'm hurtin the 
 Vaginal area, fallopian tubes and your cervix 
 I strongly recommend that for your gen' you get some Jergens 
 I find it beneficial; not to force the issue 
 I just blow my shit and wipe you see a head it's like tissue 
 Use em and throw em away, see a ho a day is essential 
 If you want a piece of the rock, trick, go to Prudential 
 Cause I rock a buyer babe on the treetop 
 And when the wind blows, my dick'll get hard, the cradle will rock 
 I'm like the peacock on NBC, Nuttin But Cock 
 I pump, prrrrrrrrrrrump pump it up yo, like a Reebok 
 Hey, I don't sell junk, but I'm a Junkyard Dog 
 And when I Duke it's a Hazzard, so call me Boss Hog 
 Or Roscoe P. Co-- ohhhhh! pain 
 That's the sound of the Caravan... running the train 
 Yeahhhh yeahh, bitch 
 That's the sound of the Caravan, running the train 
 Owwowhwahaheha! Check it out, check it out yeah, in yo' eye! 
 Yeahh! Hahhh! Yeahh! 
  
 Twilite Tone got tricks up my sleeve 
 Immenslope got tricks up my sleeve 
 Yo DRK got tricks up my sleeve

 [Rayshel] 
 I'm not a Jake or a Rake or a ho, but I got the mo' better 
 For head of the class 
 And if you ask me I'm not tryin ta be drastic 
 I'm not a bitch like Robin Givens I'm concerned about your 
 Plastic, ask it, I'll tell you what you wanna know 
 And if I tell you no, don't be all up on it dope 
 Frontin so your friends won't know that you got the 86 
 So you call me a bitch 
 You get your kicks, but Kix and Trix are for kids 
 I don't turn no tricks, I don't suck no Dix-ie cups 
 I hops in the hubba Hubba Bubba I'm like 
 Al B. stud, cause if I'm not your lover or your friend 
 Don't try to spend, waste your time 
 Tryin to get a taste of mine but you ain't tastin mine 
 So find a new type puss, cause if I don't like you 
 You ain't gettin service G, this ain't the drivethru 
 Drive by, way far, and everything'll be groovy 
 Then you pester me? Yo I'mma tell ya like the Nubians 
 Move on black brotha move on 
 You gotta move on black brotha move on[Hook: Martina Topley-Bird] 
 How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come? 
 And though it tastes like forever 
 It may not stay long 
 Everywhere is summer. (x4) 
  
 [Verse 1: Martina Topley-Bird] 
 A shaman since before my birth 
 And I came down to rock the Earth 
 My mission condition: 
 I give you, you listen 
 I'm syncing in time in parallel 
 In binary, no 3rd return 
 I'm planning intention 
 With all the redemption 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop 
 We gon'do this thang till the sky just drop 
 Lock into ya mind away we rock 
 In a rocket is the 87 astronaut 
 Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole 
 At the moment they were saying, "It was outta control" 
 Strap in to your mind, why eyes see some recline 
 You'll see in time your season to shine 
 When the stadium is dark, emcees are defined 
 Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line 
 The race is on to space beyond 
 You gon' get there by doing what you want 
 Sometimes the most famous feel all alone 
 So we drift to a place that we call our home 
 I was known as being spaced and outta my dome 
 Now I know, it's all I've known 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1] 
 Everybody want a piece of the action bruh 
 It's a beast on the streets, no relaxing up 
 Trying to figure if it's heat or is it passion for 
 Do niggas want to eat or are we scavengers? 
 In the Jeep, two deep, I'm the passenger 
 Rolling with my guy to pick the package up 
 His main broad, he kept his stash with her 
 He trying not to look, she got an ass on her 
 Got out the truck, blasting BDP 
 These young bucks wasn't up 
 They barely heard of me 
 It's the Ickes where it's murder and debris 
 The nature of the place 
 To move birds and trees, the days felt strange (?) 
 Walked to the courts to watch the games (?) 
 Dappin' niggas up like Group Home 
 I'm saying to my man we gotta move on 
  
 [Hook] 
 Let's move 
 Yeah, we gotta move 
 Y'all niggas know we gotta move 
 Cause we paid dues 
 It's time to make moves 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Trucked up ten flights of stairs, yo 
 Out of air, gasping for air, help 
 Down pissy hallways, that's their room 
 I'm saying this bitch better be there yo 
 Music loud out apartment ten oh four 
 With her nipples all hard just by open the door 
 Gave her a hug and said what up though 
 She said take your shoes off, just mopped the floor 
 She and D went to the back to handle the stack 
 Her uncle laid on the couch with a bottle of yak 
 Talking smack, smelling like crack 
 In less then a minute I heard a yell in the back 
 He said where the fuck is my money yo 
 The bitch came out the room running yo 
 Her uncle jumped up and reached for his chrome 
 I'm thinking on him, we might have to move on 
  
 [Outro] 
 We gotta move 
 Let's move 
 We gotta move 
 The state productions gonna move[Intro] 
 I like to welcome everybody to the LP, One Day It'll All Make Sense, by me. What I want to do to you... nah, really it's for you, is open my mental window, hoping that you would climb in, or if not, at least look in. I want to take you to places that I have been and to the places that I want to go. I mean this music, it ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me, I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while, it's like my whole life has become a style. I want to get into it... yeahY'all let um know 
 I'm the coldest MC Joe you dig 
  
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
  
 I was raise in city where the blood is cold 
 Big hats Cadillacs and we love some gold 
 Looking for something real something pretty to hold 
 I'm king so I wrote livid imperial souls 
 I can tell you one them undercover video hoes 
 The way you shake I might just give you a role 
 Radios TV stole the soul 
 Now these playa's in the game really don't know they role 
  
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
  
 You tryin' to look real sexy 
 You wanna get some lovers 
 You know your stomach's too big 
 For you to be wearing them hip hugger 
 You need to work it out work it off juke it out 
 And use your mind the way you use your mouth 
 I'm from a stripper hustler with names like Chip and Buster 
 Come to the crib with that bogus 
 Them boys will nip and tuck ya 
 Are you a righteous brother 
 Still I might just touch her, build her and destruct her 
 Come with heat that'll burn like Usher 
  
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
  
 Rockin' don't stop it now, uh 
 Rockin' don't stop it now, uh 
 Shock it don't stop it now, uh 
 Shock it don't stop it now, uh 
 You can keep freakin' now, uh 
 You can do the freak girl 
  
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool[Hook: John Legend] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (They say, They say...) 
 They don't knowwwww 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 They say a nigga lost his mind 
 But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme 
 The thin line between love and hatred 
 I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life 
 They say life is what you make it 
 So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it 
 As high as the stakes get when paper get low 
 I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show" 
 Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low 
 The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough 
 They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say 
 My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray 
 Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine 
 They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes" 
 I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye 
 They never could say - tell 'em, J 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Consequence] 
 See my life was kinda simple like Nicole and Paris 
 'Til i started making dollars like I rolled with Paris 
 Then we went our seperate ways like annulling a marriage 
 Cause they talk behind my back even worse than the past 
 Cause while i tried to make it happen they preferred an excuse 
 And that rubbed me the wrong way like a pervert masseuse 
 Cause nothing free about juice when you go to the market 
 So how you using mine just to corner the market 
 Now I'm more of a target than the items in Target 
 And matter fact homie I'm tired of talkin' 
 So if you got them killers what you need to do is send one 
 Otherwise start calling me Ben cause i been one 
 Cause 'Quence getting stung ain't in this package deal 
 So I'm screening all my calls like the actors deal 
 And since [?] in the hood is even higher than Dre Day 
 I could give a damn about the things that they say 
  
 [Hook]Come on people 
 You've got to stop sleepin' 
 It's time to move on 
 We're time traveling 
 We're time traveling 
 We just want things to be right 
 So, we're time traveling 
 Come on people 
 You've got to stop sleeping (we're time traveling) 
 It's time to start moving (we're time traveling)Yeah.. 
 Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.. 
 Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO.. 
  
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare 
 You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most 
 They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. 
 .. to the most, high 
 Regardless of what happen on him let's rely 
  
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side.. 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 Yo, yo, check it 
 It's important, we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write 
 For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall 
 For better or worst times, I hope to me you call 
 So I pray everyday more than anything 
 Friends will stay as we begin to lay 
 This foundation for a family - love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually 
 Granted we known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side, oh darling 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 Yeah.. yo, yo, check it 
 It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh 
 Suggestin beats I should rhyme to 
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good 
 I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal 
 It's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'ma lead you 
 And whatever's right, I'ma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace 
  
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side.. 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 (I'll) take my chances.. before they pass.. 
 .. pass me by, oh darling.. 
 You need to look at the other side.. 
 You'll agree..[Chorus: Lalah Hathaway] 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 To be young, gifted and black and own it 
 It's more than a moment 
 It's like the sun rose to condone it 
 Before we was trapping we was trapped in 
 Sun and the whips kissing our black skin 
 Strange fruit hanging, smell the jasmine 
 Rock to Coltrane, listen to jazz then, back then 
 We came with names like James, Fatima 
 Nina, King, dreamer 
 Redeemer of the people 
 Songs for the heaple 
 Original, spiritual content 
 You can smell it when it's God-sent 
 We keep it moving everyday, we the target 
 The young, gifted and black on the market 
 Cause of that we pay with our lives 
 Or either catching charges 
 But yo, the goddess is in God's ears 
 Young, gifted and black 
  
 [Chorus: Lalah Hathaway] 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Mississippi goddam, Ferguson goddam 
 Staten Island goddam, Baltimore goddam 
 America damn 
 I tell you who I am, but you don't understand 
 Across the waters I swam, son and daughters of the land 
 Yeah we the black sheep but you slaughtering the lamb 
 You try to silence with your sirens 
 Sounds of violence do nothing but divide us 
 Evolution of revolution retribution, it's due us 
 The old ways of the US, it ain't the new us 
 Tell em we the stars, they can't shoot us 
 Through prisons and wars, you could no longer recruit us 
 Salvation is due us 
 Even before we came, God knew us 
 God knew us 
 Yeah, God know us 
  
 [Chorus: Lalah Hathaway] 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
 Young, gifted and black 
 To be young, gifted and black 
  
 [Skat: Lalah Hathaway][Verse 1: Erykah Badu & Common] 
 Everyone hides their faces 
 Behind a mask they wear 
 Jimi was a rock star 
 Searching for that magic place 
 That he could touch in the sky 
 Just to get his people high 
  
 [Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Common] 
 Life is so colorful 
 Reds, blues and dreams 
 Jimi lives in a purple haze 
 In a psychedelic maze 
 Playing the streets like an instrument 
 Pulling strings wherever he went 
 Angel sent from the sky 
 Just to get his people high 
  
 [Bridge: Erykah Badu & Common] 
 Women all around 
 Fast cars and sound 
 And freedom he was bound 
 Couldn't see the ground 
 Jimi, come out why don't you set me free? (set me free) 
  
 [Verse 3: Erykah Badu & Common] 
 So high, born to fly 
 Getting high off his own supply 
 With the most highs of the sky 
 Everybody follows the same lord 
 Choosing his light to guide the way 
 You do, but who do you choose? 
 Some try things but few die so young 
 Something among Jimi was stung 
 Everyone hides their faces 
 Behind a mask they wear 
  
 [Outro: Erykah Badu] 
 (Jimi, come out why don't you set me free?) 
 [Repeat until fade out]InstrumentalI can tell just by the way y'all dressed 
 It's just just so fresh 
 The brother Com Sense, yo, I been complex for a second 
 But I'mma just keep resurrecting 
 My people, my mic and your mic, no equal 
 Anyone that wanna go against Common Sense 
 I don't even think they got enough confidence 
 Cause I will never know, I got too much flow 
 And I will rock this mother.. from the go, hey 
 I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, hey 
 I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, hey 
 I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, uh 
 I be rocking from the go, hey 
  
 It's like this, y'all, I'm coming through 
 With a different type of view, I said check-a one two 
 The way that I style, the style'll be free 
 This is 28 Days, AT&T 
 And this is what I'm telling y'all as I watch ya 
 We heard a speech from Desiree Rogers 
 You know how it go, she do it for the people 
 She's Johnson & Johnson's CEO 
 That's just how it go, she's a woman 
 Got the people thinking bout the right things 
 That's coming in our heads 
 I'm coming off the head, never been misled 
 Just down for the black and the red 
 And the black people know that we need to grow 
 And let you people know, yo, we here to go 
 Windy City, Com Sense I never been phony 
 Hanging around Cottage Grove and snowy 
 And State Street, that's a great street 
 And let you know, some of these girls I had to meet 
 Back in the days, with them different type of flows 
 I used to see them girls when I was at Hero's 
 Or better yet, Shake Rick's 
 I could just flick Bics 
 And understand, yo, you could just get a quick flick 
 And let you know about these type of flows 
 I see the lady with the camera, so I pose.. 
  
 It's like that y'all, yo, I be a singer 
 Yeah, earlier I messed up my finger 
 Hooping downtown; I got the round mound 
 I came down with that soul body pound 
 I was representing who? Um, Chi-town 
 Just the way we like to do it and get down 
 Lost and found, y'all know the sound 
 My man Main Venom, yo, he put it down 
 On the one and twos 
 Yo, we come from the Chi 
 Y'all can listen to him on GCI 
 Cause that's my guy, and I'm so fly 
 And we be down with my man Rob in the sky 
 You know Rob Kelly 
 The brother Com Sense checking now, you can't tell me 
 No type of story; I don't do this all y'all just for the glory 
 I do it so some people just know they can't ignore me 
 They can't ignore the blackness 
 Can't team up the jackness 
 I'm telling y'all, this is like Sounds of Blackness 
 So when it comes to this, yo, I don't be amazed 
 We gon' keep doing this for 28 days 
 And I'mma say love to all those that see 
 We rocking this for AT&T[Verse 1] 
 The city it blow deep, I know them cold streets 
 Motif is no peace, can't trust the police 
 My mama stay out East, hope that she good though 
 She from Inglewood so she know the hood though 
 Corners we stood on, that's what I stand for 
 Justice for hustlers I rap and I chant for 
 Cousin just got off that thang on his ankle 
 He seeing that corner from a new angle 
 Same old to same old, some days are painful 
 They say be careful, Grandma be stay prayerful 
 My bros move words with their eyes on sparrow 
 You in the ghetto where we never settle 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The breath of the city, no rest for the weary 
 No stress it can't hear me, a fist full of fury 
 No dollars no jewelry, a Chicago story 
 Place that can kill me is one that can cure me 
 Hard to ignore me 'cuz we livin' loud now 
 Fire inside me and things that go "Bow Bow" 
 Label me wild child, my old man on trial now 
 Yeah I'm the future but live for the now now 
 Make my mama proud now, we come from that dirt 
 I put in that work until my back hurt, uhWelcome everybody to the station that plays all the jams all the time 
 This is the illustrious and praiseworthy Muhammad Ali 
 Comin' at you live, so live, you can hear me live 
 Only here on WMOE. Where the FM stands for faaaaaat music! 
 Comin' up next is a brand new tune from a personal associate of mine 
 Comin' straight out Chicago on Relativity Records 
 Here's a little something called Thisisme 
 And just remember you heard it here fist at WMOE 108.9 
 Your high energy Hip Hop station 
 Gettin' on down with the big bad sounds 
 Check it out as we, continue on[Common] 
 Yeah yeah 
 You know, Slick, why do he wanna come crib 
 Acting like he know how the brothers live? 
 We have to let 'em know 
 We have to let 'em know 
 Heeeeere we go 
  
 Behold a pair of white horses on the Death Wish course 
 Been watching MTV, reading articles in The Source 
 Lost on the other side of the river 
 Where death approaches the livest nigga 
 I wonder why this wigga 
 Would even come around my tilt 
 With grandmothers cry, uncles get high, and cats get pealed 
 My guys will deal with him, he got no rhythm 
 So let the steel hit him, we speaking jail diction 
 Ho work and day oppression 
 Turn up the bass and let the system thump 
 So my neighbors won't hear the sparks as the lead gets pumped 
 Its a pre-(?) agreement in the cement jungle 
 Kill each other over money and white boys for fun 
  
 [Female Singer] 
 Don't come my way 
 Hawks feel the day 
 Things don't change, oh no 
 Don't you come my way 
 Come my way 
 See the day, oh no 
  
 [Slick Rick] 
 Little family so a junky living act as 
 Started smoking crack to fill the void within my black ass 
 1999, rolling as some broke cat 
 These white kids asking questions 
 About where to buy some coke at 
 Kinda shock a dude, Ruler turn a sucker to 
 Show 'em where these cats at, maybe earn a rock or two 
 Retarded, not knowing the kid hardest trife 
 Kill 'em, asswipes, I'll have a new start in my life 
 Till the drug lord knock upon their (?) 
 Disprespected, "Washed up rapper, what the fuck you want?" 
 The often asked, I could see others laugh 
 I got my man he wanna a buy a half a ki off your ass 
 Scolding 'em, sleeping and sold on 'em 
 Gimme the cash 
 Let me flash it through this peephole on 'em (Check it out) 
 He got hyped quick, pursued in the tight crib 
 Emptied on their asses, including the white kids 
  
 [Female Singer] 
 Don't come my way 
 Hawks feel the day 
 Things don't change, oh no 
 Don't you come my way 
 Come my way 
 See the day, oh no 
  
 [Common] 
 Yo, How'd dude go cop a brick when he ain't got the loot 
 Ricky D, get the heat and 'Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute" 
 This wigga gots no heart from his Iowa start 
  
 [Slick Rick] 
 And a Section 8 cat, he don't want any part 
 I put two in there, ruin their, pursuing their souvenir 
 Nigga, what the fuck is that white behind DOING here? 
 Won't you say you wanted to slug 'em 
 "If your not here for the cable or the (?) ya BUGGIN" 
  
 [Common] 
 Lights flooded the scene, there was blood and si-reens 
 (sirens) 
 The cops shot the brother, I still hear him scream 
 Black mans reality, white mans bad dream 
 Familiar scene from the Ickeys to the Cabrini-Green 
 Its pissy hallways, broke elevators always (ya know) 
 Ain't no place for our children to play 
 I try to go out in the summer and be feeling the day 
 These broke and stupid niggas, yo they still in the way 
  
 [Slick Rick] 
 One of the mightiest slang, and plus the night is young 
 I got long term money draining ideas from 
 Since they far, I'll find your brown sweetheart 
 Just being white your like golden goose around these parts 
 Hey retard, better hurry in, my name is Father Marion 
 I'll hold that American Express card your carrying 
 Put your nose up, don't, shut up, provoking and woke up 
 First where do you live, how much money your folks got? 
  
 [Female Singer] 
 Don't come my way 
 Hawks feel the day 
 Things don't change, oh no 
 Don't you come my way 
 Come my way 
 See the day, oh no 
 Don't come my way 
 Hawks feel the day 
 Things don't change, oh no 
 Don't you come my way 
 Come my way 
 See the day, oh no 
  
 [Common] 
 We let the rhythm go 
 Common Sense will 'em hit where I hit 'em 
 Common Sense will spin 'em check it out 
 I guess I did 'em where they should to be done 
 Ain't nothing new about the wonder rap son 
 Closed styles like captions yo its time for some action 
 Man, I get bread, niggas get me sled 
 When I come up off their head, it was said 
 For that, yo, it's like this 
 Common Sense'll strike this, mic this 
 Just like some punchlines 
 How niggas follow me like one time 
 Everybody love me like the sunshine 
 Combine, ain't that you never knew of 
 Niggas say one but I've got two loves 
 Check it out, now how I do love...[Intro] 
 "I met this girl when I was ten years old" 
 I had a dream, a dream since I was a kid 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm moving, yes I'm moving on, the motor turning over 
 I met her when I was 10 as I began to grow older 
 Exposed to the culture, culture that would change me 
 With the mic check I paint a picture like Banksy 
 Concrete rose going through hoes and blows 
 On a paper chase, I found out I was chose 
 A fetish for clothes, success, and blessing the hood 
 The struggles of an MC progressing through the good 
 Music for the 90s, 2000s, and beyond 
 It started with me wanting niggas to say me could rhyme 
 And now it's my time, then now it's forever 
 Change the world, raps and styles getting better 
 Revolutionize and rising above the game again 
 My career is fading in, like a DJ on a blend 
 Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics 
 This is hip-hop y'all, we driving for the spirit 
  
 [Outro] 
 No I.D. is in the house 
 Twilight Tone he's in the house 
 J. Period is in the house 
 Kanye, he's in the house 
 G.O.O.D. Music, we in the house 
 J. Dilla, he's in the house 
 Yo, The Roots they in the house 
 Kristen Mills is in the house 
  
 I had a dream, a dream since I was a kid 
  
 "They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me" 
 "I met this girl when I was ten years old 
 And what I loved most, she had so much soul"[Verse] 
 On Oscar night, this is the dream we tell 
 A land where Dreamers live and freedom dwells 
 Immigrants get the benefits 
 We put up monuments for the feminists 
 Tell the NRA they in God's way 
 And to the people of Parkland, we say "ashay" 
 Sentiments of love for the people 
 From Africa, Haiti to Puerto Rico[Common] 
 On the streets on the side 
 I look a man in his face eye to eye 
 And wonder why 
 I don't wanna die 
 I hope you don't wanna die 
 So why bring it my way? 
  
 "Common Sense in a ghetto in Chicago" 
  
 [Common] 
 Yo Tekzilla 
 You know I ain't the type to play killa 
 But this day still arrives in my mind like a flight on down 
 Thursday night had plans to be out 
 Till the night served daylight 
 But it ain't happen 
 Rappin' to myself cause there wasn't noone to rap to 
 This feeling came to me like somebody lookin' at you 
 There was these cats who me and my crew boxed against 
 Got a, spot and a Glock, now the nigga's got some confidence 
 Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness 
 He was prop to dis mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch 
 I could sense he was tryin' to bring it 
 But I wasn't ready to receive it 
 In fact I made him leave it 
 Before he could achieve it 
 As we rolled through the streets of Cottage Grove 
 And reach the stoplight 
 Behind me, he flashed lights bright, sorta cop-like 
 I'm thinkin' 2Pac-like cause he got out the car 
 I was taught only to fight in defense or the in will of Allah 
 And ain't no talking when it's time to spar 
 So before he popped some shit I did ??I act my shit is solo?? 
 Back his lady trying to hold him like big pun 
 I stowed 'em and told 'em 
 I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot 
 Between blows this nig' tried to up his Glock 
 His brother watched spooked like a daddy on teenage love 
 He got 'buked til my tape I got sing like a dove 
 Got his dome into her 
 My fist brought back the one hand 
 Tried to pop it musta been a Nas cause the gun jammed 
 Unplanned I disarm this trick nigga 
 Pistol-whipped his ass, his lady's I was palmin' it 
 Hollered 87 reign dominant 
 Needed a fight that night 
 Me and my woman had a argument 
  
 "I guess I should tell you a little something about myself" 
 "I bang with the big boys, those who hold game" 
  
 [Common] 
 Hey now why you gotta hold yo' thang? 
 Scared to shoot, scared to shoot 
 Shoot for the revolut- 
 Yo 
 Peace y'all Common Sense and Hi Tek 
 Traveling the world it's just a day in the life 
 Of real niggas[Hook] 
 I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas 
 I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas dawg 
 Stay schemin' 
 Niggas tryna get at me (dawg) 
 I ride for my niggas 
 Stay schemin' 
 Niggas tryna get at me (dawg) 
 I ride for my niggas 
  
 [Rick Ross - Verse 1] 
 Damn, life so short, fuck it, I dont wanna go to court 
 Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer though 
 Fuck it, I'm on the run for the money 
 I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it 
 My lil niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid 
 I'm gettin money, thats in any nigga category 
 Double M I got G's out in California 
  
 [Hook] 
 [Drake] 
 It bothers me when the Gods get to acting like the broads 
 Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours 
 Thats why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all 
 I just ask them when you see me you speak up nigga thats all 
 Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing 
 Its feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged 
 Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon 
 Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record 
 Spaghetti bolognese in Appolo lounge 
 Me and my G from DC thats how I roll around 
 Might look light, but we heavy though 
 You think Drake will pull some shit like that you never know 
 Million dollar meetings in appollo lounge 
 Me and my man all Oliver North thats how I roll around 
 Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga 
 I tell a bitch its more attractive when you hold it down 
 Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M's 
 Kobe my nigga I hate it, had to be him 
 Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym 
 (Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym) 
 Tell Lucien I said fuck it I'm tearing holes in my budget 
 Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public 
 Ordered it a filet tell her butterfly she'll love it 
 She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin' 
 Im just hittin my pinnacle you and pussy identical 
 You like the f-ckin finish line we can't wait to run into you 
 But let me get my mind of that 
 Young rich muthaf-cker getting mine off rap 
 With my niggas 
  
 [Hook] 
 [Common] 
 My motto is: Chicago, bitch 
 Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is 
 Don't play dumb, I'm the one that acknowledged it 
 Son of a bitch, I imagine what your father is 
 She said, "How you make your opponent, the rapper of the moment?" 
 His style, he don't own it 
 Acting all hard when he hardly like that 
 You gon' mess around and make me catch a body like that, ooooh 
 Don't do it 
 'Cause every song you make Joe is really hoe music 
 I heard you said you wasn't a bitch because you sing 
 You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that's eighteen 
 Can't say my name but rap about a nigga's wife 
 You so black and white, tryna to live a nigga's life 
 I'm taking too long with this amateur guy 
 You ain't wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry 
 [Common Speaking] 
 Soft nigga, make no mistake, I'm talking to Drake 
 It's the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that hoe ass nigga 
 No, man-to-man, don't hide behind them other niggas 
 Nah, this man-to-man. You can't run behind them man 
 This is some real man shit right here 
 [Destiny's Child] 
 Say my name, say my name 
 If no one is around you 
 If you ain't running game 
 Say my name, say my name 
 You acting kinda shady 
 Why the sudden change? 
 Say my name, say my name 
 If no one is around you 
 If you ain't running game

 C'mon man, gimme somethin man! 
 Common! Ah-heh! 
  
 Let's Make a Deal, pickle I'm pitchin penny dimes and nickles 
 You couldn't sell a sticker, on the tape your DJ tickles 
 I jiggle and juggle the rhymes like, I was to keep you suckers all waiting 
 My tub I rub-a-dub it with my rubber duck I play 
 With those quack MC's, someone's been sittin in my chair 
 And I'mma wash that crank right outta my hair 
 Shampoo but, I'm down with the Nubian Nut, Joe and go for self 
 You're buggin buddy doin somebody nosin don't know yourself 
 Peace to Sef and Jeff, Tae ?Deesy Dirty and Don Tanean? 
 Haste makes waste, so with the case is how my day begins 
 Hot in quarter vader shops the sports day market pelo 
 I'm think of my pap, the doctor slapped me in the hospital with a G-O 
 Word is bond when I was born, and I took a breath 
 I never rhyme with busted rhymes and even the blind knew I was def 
 Respect to Chico ?Waller Al Kadee Roscoe Kalidjusome? 
 Poo-da, Ba Ba, Luther, the Baby B-Boyz always into some 
 Time for get me drunk, ?Stu and more my cousin adulay? 
 Fuck the bitches who dissed us and the hoes who wouldn't give Rash' a play 
 I'mma play, and which way, until I get my new props 
 Peace to Ricki Love the rockin shot to all the beer spots 
 The marks we used to stick up, the posse gets much thicker 
 To those who I forgot yo I'mma blame it on the liquor 
 That's my nigga list, to those who I missed 
 My ass you can kiss I gotta piss[Verse 1: Common] 
 Common sense right now I'm like the sinner 
 Mix me up, y'all you can put me in the blender 
 Understanding style this is the style I make 
 Put me in the blender and I end up like a shake 
 A protein one yo, yo I get it done 
 Questlove on the drums 
 Yo, yo I gotta run with a different type of style, yo a different type of flow 
 I'm from Chicago, yo I got the snowplow 
 Snowplow and you know that's not soul glo 
 Common sense sometimes I go solo 
 It's like this common sense I'm comin' down 
 This is what I do, yo I hold down the fort yo 
 This is what I'm comin' to yo, it's just me and you 
 Shout out to my man named Keanu 
 And we come through yo, y'all know I fix 
 Y'all know Keanu for what the matrix 
  
 [Verse 2: Black Thought] 
 Yeah, let me put this brick to mortar 
 Three words in that particular order 
 Ain't no two cents I'ma give you a quarter 
 Com had to take from the butcher's daughter 
 Had a bottle of water, I drank it 
 I'm ice cold with it, get me a blanket 
 Now I'm saying hold up, I'm on the thanks tip 
 Writing thank you notes just like James and Frank did 
 Hold up, yo, bring the style back 
 Just like you got hijacked 
 On cloud nine with it, girls reachin' they climax 
 I'm larger than life, I'm like the imax 
 The baddest rapper she's heard of 
 Matter fact I take it three further 
 Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger 
  
 [Verse 3: Common] 
 Common sense yo I'm with the roots crew 
 Hip-hop, hip-hopping like a kangaroo 
 What can I do yo, I can't hold back 
 Call me kangaroo jack or kangaroo black 
 Black thought yo, we all sorta driving 
 Understand Com Sense I'm always soul surviving 
 Coming clean I don't even need the green 
 I'm in the green you see me in the limousine 
 And we be on the team 
 Yo, I got this sheen like my man Questlove with the afro 
 Sometimes I battle sometimes I straddle formality 
 Common Sense I'm the realest in virtual reality 
 Comin' real with this type of style  from the Stoney Isle 
 Only child, yo I'm with Jimmy Fal' 
 Holdin' down the fort 
 Yo it's like a sport 
 I'm down with The Roots crew and Black Thought(Oh no...) 
 Yeah (Geto Heaven) 
 God bless... 
  
 [Macy Gray] 
 Hummmmm...oooh, right, need a little Geto Heaven 
 Need a little Geto Heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto heaven, need a little Geto Heaven (Heaven) 
 Geto... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Search for a love, throughout the ghetto 
 Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow 
 I got my third, eye on the sparrow 
 Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel 
 The mother of my child, we not together 
 Baby, it's your back, I got forever 
 The weather, talks to us 
 Henrock, the Holy Spirit walks through us 
 The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide 
 A thug is a lost man in disguise 
 The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble 
 I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver 
 Feeling at times, that I might just murder 
 Yo, that ain't what I was sent for 
 I want folks to say his life it meant more 
 Than any car, any rock, or any broad 
 He found Geto Heaven in himself and God 
 (Found Geto Heaven in himself and God) 
 Found Geto Heaven in himself and God 
  
 [Hook: Macy Gray] 
 Geto Heaven... (Need a little...) 
 Need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven...(Need a little...) 
 Time we get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man 
 Strong woman, why should you depend on a man? 
 I understand you want a man that's resourceful 
 If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you 
 Talking to a friend, about what love is 
 Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his 
 Hugged her from afar, said what I felt 
 You never find a man, 'til you find yourself 
 Time helps mistakes, you can learn from 
 One man F'd up, men you shouldn't turn from 
 You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too 
 At that destination, a king will anoint you 
 Going through the storm, many bodies seem warm 
 That relationship died, for you to be born, you're worth more 
 Than anything you could cop at a store 
 For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stoppin' him for? 
 Not even I could ignore being alone is hard 
 Find heaven in yourself and God 
 Find heaven in yourself and God, girl 
 (Find heaven in yourself and God) 
  
 [Hook: Macy Gray] 
 Geto Heaven... (Need a little...) 
 Need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven...Need a little... 
 Time we get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto... 
 La, la, la, la... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This music is so much bigger than me 
 As far as happy, it's like a trigger to me 
 Dealing with crab rappers, groupie broads 
 Record execs, at times it do be hard 
 To choose words, be heard across waters 
 Doing something you like to support daughters 
 Keeping your guys from collecting court orders 
 Conveying messages the ancestors brought us 
 Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day 
 Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it 
 Music is a gift that is sacred 
 I opened it, used it, hoping you could grow to it 
 Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it 
 Can't imagine going through it, without soul music 
 It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path 
 On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep 
 And show depth, as we make people nod 
 Find heaven in this music and God, yeah 
 (Find heaven in this music and God, y'all) 
 Find heaven in this music and God, check it, it's Geto Heaven, baby 
  
 [Hook: Macy Gray] 
 Geto Heaven... (Need a little...) 
 Need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven...Need a little... 
 Time we get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven 
 Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven..."If you put a bunch of rappers with their notebooks against 
 Ynot and Common Sense, they will be lynched" 
  
 The Late Show! (And you don't stop!) 
 Common Sense!  (And you don't stop!) 
 U-Ack!         (And you don't stop!) 
 Them there!    (And you don't stop!) 
  
 [Common] 
 I'm not tall, but can I bust? 
 Like the double dutch, going down the street 
 I rap to myself when there ain't no one to rap to 
 And to me, yo, my shit be sounding sweet 
 It's like doo wop, doo wop, oop 
 I chew with my group, eating chicken and we're couped in a hoop 
 Deee! Somebody's breath is smelling boo- 
 Teee! Tone, is that you? (I don't think so) 
 I'm one time, two times, three times a lady 
 Bay-beh, bay-beh, bay-bee 
 Ha! I be making happy, ladi de, ladi da 
 When I was a boy I said "Oh" but now I'm a man saying "Ah" 
 Cha cha cha, who knows where the mouth goes 
 Yeah nigga, I'm fly, so keep your fucking mouth closed 
 Ralph goes "Rasheed" and I be saying "Boo!" 
 Bitches welcome back Common with the "Oooh oooh ooh" 
 And this is how I wreck it, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 This is how I wreck it, do doo doo do doo 
 Now one two check it, I'm as Def as a Leppard 
 It could be, it should be, it is?  Holy cow! 
 I'm grand slamming slamming like the ?common Billy section? 
 Not the Godfather, but I lounge like a stepper 
 Breatha, breaks it, 8, we wait 
 (Ch ch chaa) I got scratch like a DJ 
 I used to want to be like, I used to want to be like 
 Mike, but the man in the mirror don't know if he's black or white 
 And that makes me mad 
 (Backwards scratching) Who's bad? 
  
 [Ynot] 
 Now can I bust in this era, I'm a plus like addition 
 And listen, I'm dishing out ish like a chef 
 The love is the Late Show, showing you the ladies 
 You late on the show? Oh we the greatest show? You right 
 To might right, raise, to my left, boom bap 
 In the back, Blazay Blah, so get the fuck out my face 
 Oh what a disgrace, you can't disgrace 
 Boys I'll erase you boys to mincemeat 
 Human means T, O's, N's, why's this is just a tease before my album 
 No bum acts out, I'm out to parlay you Fritos 
 Corn chips off the block, so bust it down, just bust the sound 
 Exciting as a big zap 
 I frighten those biting when Lord jabber tighten when tighten taken to loose 
 Ynot's no loser but I lost your real mind 
 I find you, finder's keeper's so you mind too 
 Your mind can't match mine when I do mine 
 Call mine, my mouth is a fucking gold mine 
 Bought y'all like monster malls, I get ate like the balls 
 I got to rhyme, too, I climb you like a stepson 
 No weapon, but I got a rep, son, for taking fakes to the towel 
 Snakes in my file 
 Foul ish, I'll sit down all stand-up comic rappers 
 Who diss now but don't understand fashion 
 Fasten your seatbelts til heat melts to ice 
 T.O.N.Y.'s backwards, nevertheless 
 I attack nerds, fuck what you heard, hambone 
 Hey, gone when I finish, women and niggas say "Damn, Tone" 
 That's busted 
  
 	Bust it out, chant chant 
 	Common Sense you know is running things 
 	Late Show you know is running things 
 	You ain't seeing us though we running things 
 	Yeah, you know they running things 
  
 [Ynot] 
 Usually I'm the second voice, this time I'm the first choice 
 In the rhyme, I'm no prancer, so what? 
 Momma mock me, here's your time to jock, G, no jacking 
 Don't pack no axe like a savage 
 I ran the track stars back to their crate, create craters 
 In they ass, I'm holding one for fun 
 One tht plays golf, can't raise play tennis 
 Women plays croquet, and Blazay plays the cut 
 Still make the women say "Hey" 
 Yodle lay hey hee hoo, in my way dead 
 Yo I lay she hoo, in my bed 
 Ask Common, I did your momma, nah I took it easy 
 Gave it hard hell, on a scale from 1 to 10 
 I'm rich, I own a Jet, Ebony, and Essence 
 And Essence say I'm strong cause with the pen I've been a Bad Boy 
 A sad boy, I call your girl 13 cause she's good 
 Should I say more?  I see more, I see more 
 ]From sea shore to sea shore, I sell my yacht and play Yatzee 
 Ynot's the posse, dressing tight, yo I'm friendly 
 Who's the master, the weak-minded say I rock too strong 
 The short-winded say I rhyme to long 
 So niggas told me, "Please let me go to the peasants" 
 No, let me stop, chow, baby 
  
 [Common] 
 Baby, baby, baby, POP! 
 Kids call me coffee because I *jugga jugga jugga* drop! 
 And you don't stop, don't put on the red light 
 While I rock player, I coach more (niggas) than John Thompson 
 I'm in your town, George, I got it made like Florance 
 I'm getting bigger than the lips on Martin Lawrence 
 Kiss *Mmuah, mmuah* It's like, it's like this 
 A Sermon like Erick, did a B.A.P. just like Tists 
 Well, I'm not Jehovah, but can I get a witness? 
 I shoot the gift rapping, then wish you a Merry Christmas 
 With he quickness is how I rip this, can you dig it? 
 Well if not, then dig this, this is the way the way that I flow 
 The pimp of hip-hop, I make you say "Ho!" 
 I know you hear me knocking, like I said, like I said 
 And this is the story about a man named Jed 
 Got some lead for those hefiers, and those heifers yo I rip it out 
 My weapon, double decker, come from 1, I'm from 87 
 And I do work undercover like a cop 
 Stop in the name of Com before I break your arm 
 Plus I'm down with the U-Ack ??? and Bushman 
 Peace to the Beatnuts, peace to the Pharcyde 
 Yeah, you know what time it is 
 Yeah, that's how it is 
  
 (The silliness continues til the end)[Intro] 
 Come on, y'all, get live, get down 
 Common Sense is in your town 
 I said, come on, y'all, get live, get down 
 Common Sense, ya know... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in 
 That be scatterin' 
 Over the global my vocals be travellin' 
 Unravellin' my abdomen it's slime that's babblin' 
 Grammatics that are masculine 
 I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads 
 I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP 
 Raps I make up like blacks do excuses 
 I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces 
 If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless 
 Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines 
 They say signs of the end is near 
 I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin' a beer 
 Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager 
 Skills uglier than Craig Mack — in your ear, I'm the flavor 
 My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise 
 Don't watch the Bulls as much, they got too many (white) boys 
 A million black men walkin' towards one direction 
 For sure, the cream of the planets—resurrection 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 A prophet, raised among Black Disciples and Vice Lords 
 Who don't give a (fuck) about mic cords 
 At night, swords get up — together, black wrists get cuffed 
 I'm wishin' for a change but my man want his change in a cup 
 Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot 
 (Bitches) put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they (ass) 
 I rule everything around me like cash 
 On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed 
 In jams I M*A*S*H like Alan Alda 
 (Niggas) nod, thangs say 'hey' as if I was Little Walter 
 87 strip walker, taught the code of the area 
 By staying, within the barrier 
 Exposed to Stony stimuli, with that I identify 
 Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness 
 Skull-cap smurf, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on 
 Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
 "Resurrection" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike 
 When in dim light, I use insight to enlight 
 Then write something that's skin tight 
 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe 
 Imagination's in flight 
 I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright 
 Get open like on gym nights 
 And in fights I send rights 
 Don't hook with skins my friends like 
 I spend nights up in dykes 
 I've been indicted as a freak of all trades 
 (That's right) I got it made 
 I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums 
 Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums 
 Had to halt with the, malt liquor 
 Off the malt liquor I fought niggas 
 Now my speech and thoughts quicker 
 Cruise the Southside streets, no heat and no sticker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 87 got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 Extra P got my back and that's my (nigga) 
 Now I'm a ho but not a ho (nigga) 
 Ain't scared of no (nigga) 
 When it's my turn to go I gotta go 
 And I'm gone with the storm 
  
 [Scratched Hook] 
 "Resurrection"Who you 
 Who you 
 Who you foolin'? 
  
 (Simultaneous Voices Throughout Song) 
  
 'There's No Defense against Common Sense' (repeated) 
 'It's Not  a Racial Thing it's just Common Sense' (repeated) 
 (Common Sense, Common Sense) (repeated)[Hook] 
 I'm the C O double M O to the N 
 You heard, motherfucker? Well boy hear me again 
 Official raw nigga from the City of Winds 
 Straight doing it, doing it, I am doing it 
 (Repeat x2) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 What the fuck is going down? Nigga you sound 
 Like a real bitch right now, the pound 
 I gave you I knew I shouldn't have gave you 
 Before you was a ho now you think the money made you 
 A slave to the rhythm, indentured servant of wisdom 
 Clinton is the pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm 
 In a poetical prison, I'm visiting self 
 For hours, coward niggas get shanked for kicking 
 Pussy raps, radio is like CO's they try to push me back 
 I rip cats out of they suits, give them they hoodies back 
 I'm from the hood we stack, black fist 
 "Ooh ohh ahh" is the sound of blackness 
 These new school cats is classless, influenced by rap shit 
 Front money, but hustle backwards 
 I break bread with broads that got they masters and hypes the blaster 
 Lawyers that work faster and young ghetto bastards 
 Became childlike with the way I style right 
 And act, because children naturally react 
 Respond to the Com as a poet I'm a last like a Don 
 Cause I'm like that yo, a phenom without shit on my arm 
 You can't coherse a verse 
 I'm a rhyme when I want to get up and rhyme 
 Some say I'm spaced like John Glenn cause of the places I've been 
 I embrace the vibe, spin, been through cases of Heinekin 
 Return to orbit on some shit that's anti-corporate in a Wild Style 
 Orchard gay rappers is getting tortured for tossing salads 
 You imbalanced, you rap about violence too much 
 I go on blind dates with mind states and go dutch 
 At my shows the law show up, they be thinking it's a hold up 
 So many hands go up, but with the band I'm colder 
 Money folder, you want a fresh style let me show you 
  
 [Hook](Instrumental)[Hook] 
 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 From the hood 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 I want a bitch that look good and cook good 
 Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood 
 Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes 
 Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes 
 We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake 
 Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait 
 To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned 
 Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible 
 The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for 
 Is the type that I ride to stay alive for 
 Tats on her back, looking all tribal 
 She know shoes like she know survival 
 Well put together, she weathers the storm 
 Seen her brother die so forever she's strong 
 Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform 
 Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 I don't even say shit, she can feel it 
 Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic 
 Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it 
 Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet 
 Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony 
 Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia 
 Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana 
 Reminded me a me of my, of my mama 
 Knowing the drama like she know when to joke 
 Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke 
 I poke my head out of Benzes 
 My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is 
 Endless love for the money, power and clothes 
 My ghetto housewife watch reality shows 
 She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed 
 When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes 
 Subject matter be changing too quickly at times 
 So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story 
 Call me a pro in the pussy category 
 Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention 
 For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction 
 Powerful women playing the roles of submission 
 Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin' 
 Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic 
 They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted 
 'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit 
 Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence 
 But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra 
 African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor 
 Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors 
 Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours 
 She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals 
 Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors 
 Half hood half class, photographers' cameras 
 Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this 
 She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit 
 Events having sponsored have some alcohol product 
 Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms 
 You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects 
  
 [Hook](feat. Erykah Badu) 
  
 (Chorus) 
 [Erykah Badu] 
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side.. 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare 
 You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most 
 They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. 
 .. to the most, high 
 Regardless of what happen on him let's rely 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Yo, yo, check it 
 It's important, we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write 
 For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall 
 For better or worse times, I hope to me you call 
 So I pray everyday more than anything 
 Friends will stay as we begin to lay 
 This foundation for a family - love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually 
 Granted we known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Yeah.. yo, yo, check it 
 It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh 
 Suggestin beats I should rhyme to 
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good 
 I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal 
 It's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'ma lead you 
 And whatever's right, I'ma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace 
  
 (Chorus)Verse 1:(Common) 
 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo' 
 We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes 
 The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 Powder blue profiles glorifying them 
  
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill

 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 Its so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 Its so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the cornerRough

 Oh Oh Oh

 There is a place for us 
 So far away 
 But it's closer than it was yesterday 
 Now we are riding 
 Along the road together 
 As one we must stay 
 But there's one thing that we can't forget 
 And that be 
  
 Never give up 
 Things are gonna get rough 
 I've got to keep on movin

 A trial and tribulation 
 Cannot get in our way

 But there's one thing that we can't forget

 {Verse One} 
 Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss 
 Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit 
 Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched 
 Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch 
 In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it 
 I'ma give it, as far as you can take it 
 Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny 
 Many can find it but few can climb it 
 I'm open-minded like a pothead 
 Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed 
 In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls 
 Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle 
 I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers 
 The world is bitter, like baby mothers 
 Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us 
 Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God 
  
 {Verse Two} 
 Everywhere is broken glass 
 Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass 
 Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast 
 Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past 
 It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon 
 Niggas is fake like bitches braggin 
 Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion 
 In motion like cars 
 I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars 
 The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours 
 Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies 
 Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me 
 (.. from a distance) niggas tried to appraise me 
 I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me 
 My days be spent, behind dream's tent 
 Through the sun the divine being is sent 
 It's the Sun God 
  
 {Verse Three} 
 Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion 
 I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position 
 I can't crystalize the mission lies within 
 Born to die even in death we begin 
 It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know 
 And carry low swing on a chariot slow 
 Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution 
 If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun 
 It's the Sun God, yeah[Hook: John Legend] 
 I believe in the light that shines and will never die 
 Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive 
 They will talk about us 
 Like they talked about the kings before us 
 They will talk about us 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 These are the words of a believer 
 Achiever, leader of the globe 
 Feeding souls of those in need 
 I bleed the blood of the struggle 
 Walking over troubled puddles 
 Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress 
 Extremities of life and it's process 
 Birth of a son, death of another 
 With love I caress both mothers 
 And told 'em, who’s in control is the one that's above us 
 I walk where money talks and love stutters 
 Body language of a nation going through changes 
 The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger 
 Anger gets sent through the chamber 
 It’s tough when your own look like strangers 
 We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers 
 If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us? 
 Look at the picture, hard not to blame us 
 But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often 
 Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them? 
 Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking? 
 Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em? 
 Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em 
 Real talking, in they ear like a walkman 
 Thoughts spin around the corner to the world 
 When I see them, I see my baby girl 
 Believe! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 The lord lives among us, the younguns hunger 
 Become a means to get it by any ways nece- 
 -ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser 
 With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors 
 Destiny’s children survivors, soldiers 
 In front of buildings they eyes look older 
 Hard to see blessings in the violent culture 
 Face against weapons, sirens, holsters 
 That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us 
 Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah 
 We go from being Precious to Oprah 
 Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas 
 Today and the way that you can see we determined 
 Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning 
 Lesson’s in our life are like stripes that we earning 
 Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning 
 Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light 
 For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys 
 Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest 
 That seems beyond us, even through the unseen 
 I know that God watches 
 From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us 
 The prophets, nothing can stop us 
 Believe! 
  
 [Hook]Yeah, this for the people 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin' to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Premo 
 'Ye you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 And the struggles of the brothas and the folks 
 With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes 
 Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder 
 Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr 
 While white folk focus on dogs and yoga 
 My people on the low end tryin to ball and get over 
 Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers 
 From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture 
 Everyday we hustlin, tryin' to get them custom rims 
 Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lustin them 
 Sick and tired of punchin it, I look on the bus at them 
 When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 The people said that I was sharp on TV 
 At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me 
 Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie 
 He said no matter what, the people gonna see me 
 Can't leave rap alone the streets need me 
 Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me 
 Inside peace mixed with beef seem to breed me 
 Nobody believe, until I believe me 
 Now I'm on the rise doin business with my guys 
 Visions realize, music affected lives 
 A gift from the skies, to be recognized 
 I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana 
 I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama 
 Standin in front of the judge with no honor 
 My raps ignite the people like Obama 
 The karma of the streets is needs and takes 
 Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks 
 Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake 
 Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake 
 The People 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find[Chorus: John Legend] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory) 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon 
 Formed against, yes glory is destined 
 Every day women and men become legends 
 Sins that go against our skin become blessings 
 The movement is a rhythm to us 
 Freedom is like religion to us 
 Justice is juxtapositionin' us 
 Justice for all just ain't specific enough 
 One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us 
 True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us 
 That's why Rosa sat on the bus 
 That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up 
 When it go down we woman and man up 
 They say, "Stay down", and we stand up 
 Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up 
 King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory (glory, glory) 
 Ohh (glory, glory) 
  
  
 [Bridge: John Legend] 
 Now the war is not over, victory isn't won 
 But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done 
 We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory) 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory) 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Selma is now for every man, woman and child 
 Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd 
 They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now 
 Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles 
 From dark roads he rose, to become a hero 
 Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people 
 Enemy is lethal, a king became regal 
 Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle 
 The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful 
 We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through 
 Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany 
 Now we right the wrongs in history 
 No one can win the war individually 
 It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy 
 Welcome to the story we call victory 
 The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) 
 Oh (glory, glory) 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) 
 Yeah (glory, glory) 
  
 [Outro: John Legend] 
 When the war is won, when it's all said and done 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory).(Chorus) 
 [Erykah Badu] 
 There are times.. when you'll need someone.. 
 I will be by your side.. 
 There is a light, that shines 
 Special for you, and me.. 
  
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare 
 You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most 
 They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. 
 .. to the most, high 
 Regardless of what happen on him let's rely 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Yo, yo, check it 
 It's important, we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write 
 For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall 
 For better or worse times, I hope to me you call 
 So I pray everyday more than anything 
 Friends will stay as we begin to lay 
 This foundation for a family - love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually 
 Granted we known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Yeah.. yo, yo, check it 
 It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh 
 Suggestin beats I should rhyme to 
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good 
 I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal 
 It's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'ma lead you 
 And whatever's right, I'ma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

 Have they lost they fuckin' mind man? 
 Know what I mean?... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A bitch nigga with a attitude named Cube 
 Tried to step to the Com with a feud 
 What the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast!? 
 You ain’t made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
 Wanted deceased, from the Midwest to the East 
 On the, dick of the East for your, first release 
 Your lease is up at the crib, house niggas get evicted 
 In videos with white boys talkin' you get "Wicked" 
 "Natural Born Killa", nigga you natural born God 
 Read, rich, got the nerve to say you rob 
 Hypocrite, I’m fillin' out your death certificate 
 Slangin' Bean Pies and St. Ides in the same sentence 
 Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 
 Get some beats besides Parliament, to rock over 
 Rap career is over, better of actin' 
 What trouble I see, in managing WC and Wack 10? 
 You backed into a four corner hustla 
 Lyin' on your dick, said you was fuckin' her 
 Use higher learning, don't take my words out of 'text 
 Went from gangsta to Islam, to the dick of Das EFX 
 It’ll take the nation of millions to hold me back from giving you mouth shots or hit, with the pipe that Ralph got 
 Chris Tucker ain’t around, it's your Friday, it was good 
 Wasn’t salty she was with the Boyz N the Hood 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lyin' 
 I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you tryin’ 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, it's comin' out, check it 
  
 I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lyin' 
 I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you tryin' 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, yeah, check it yo (yeah) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The ump of this rap shit! 
 Cube I'm callin' out 
 I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse! 
 This ain't no East Coast, West Coast, none of the above 
 I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggas gave me love 
 There's a thin line between, the fake and the real 
 Grafted ass nigga, I see through you glass shield 
 HAD SKILLS, once upon a time on this project yo (hop on dudes son, hop) 
 I'ma have to wreck a HO'Shea 
 I heard a ho say you favorite rapper... 
 So I had to slap her! 
 And violate you, a "Muslim" drinkin' brew 
 Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
 I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL 
 Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it then sell- 
 It out, like you sold Kam and Threat... 
 A year ago, you wasn't talkin' shit about the West! 
 Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable 
 " Hoo-Bangin' ", you ain't bangin' shit but the table 
 And the Circle mad, ain't got no choice but to fight (know what I mean?) 
 Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic! (no wayyss...) 
 Any time you come out, joe, I'ma talk about you 
 Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you 
 Any last words before I hit the switch? 
 From the immortal words of one: "A BITCH IS A BITCH!" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lying 
 I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you trying 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, it's comin' out yo 
  
 I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lying 
 I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you trying 
 THE BITCH IN YOU, chill, check it 
  
 [Outro] 
 (uh) Aight so that's cool... 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 It's all good baby, you can get it over here too 
 NYC, to Chi-Town ("Yeeaah!") 
 Lettin' niggas know when are we gettin' down 
 Know what I mean?Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. we always are trying 
 To put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at 
 Ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look 
 Within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. it's about 
 Relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. i'm-a do my thing 
 Over this drum, like a native tongue 
  
 Verse one 
 Q-tip: 
 Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real 
 Complicated with the skills over reel to reel 
 Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal 
 Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill 
 Constantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering 
 Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either 
 Hitting us up with great emotional chat 
 About the fact 
 That the black 
 Is constantly held back 
 Like 50 tracks back in a relay race 
 And the white team's ahead 
 So let's keep up the pace 
 And I be needing something 
 To feed my logical taste 
 At the end of the race is there a paradise place? 
 Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing 
 Material gain we put too much in persuing 
 Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party 
 But we can all mardi grati 
 Minus that shit in our body 
 What that got to do with that 
 'cause kid that's the essence 
 Your physical presence 
 Embodies every lesson 
 You can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted 
 Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard 
 What we need to do first 
 Now listen to this verse 
 Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate 
 Recognize your existence in this vast blue space 
 From a tiny cloud of blood 
 To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell 
 And sound 
 Let's deem it profound! 
 And prioritize this cause it was allah's wish 
 Allah? I'm god 
 No I ddon't believe that. that's a mystery 
 If God is so good why does shit be happening to me? 
 There's divinity within 
 Because we come from the divine 
 A froce that's not seen but you feel it every time 
 When the wind blows, and the world turns 
 And the rain drops, and the baby cries 
 And the bird flies, and the ground quake 
 And the stars gleam 
 So many things are eident of it's existence 
 What we need to do is link it with persistence 
 Once we recognize that, we can move ahead 
 Native tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred... 
  
 Common: 
 From the spiritual world my former life has developed 
 First person I lost close to me was stella 
 Some of my mellows 
 Lost their mothers and their brothers 
 For them I feel empathy 
 But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas 
 I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck 
 Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death 
 I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news 
 But when it's somebody you know it hits you 
 And emotions get bruised 
 I ain't been in your shoes 
 I won't judge you for knocking 
 Because the spirit of the ghetto says you gotta! 
 They snatch you again from rock flippin' 
 Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin' 
 Stickin' stores 
 On the strip 
 I'm tired of arabs giving me my change back 
 Devil bomb my yesterday 
 My tomorrow he never gave back 
 I lay back, looking at the ceiling 
 Wonndering what can I do 
 So my homie won't have to be dealing 
 Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better 
 Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life 
 That we have to put together, better ourselves 
 Cause families we gotta raise 
 No matter how long the money 
 Shorter become the days 
 Men become like women 
 And no difference in the season 
 If you got popped five times 
 You breathing for a reason 
 Let's put the five tenure plan into progression 
 Before we count our paper 
 Count our blessings[Hook] 
 Hands up in the air 
 Ain't no steppin' there 
 We gon' pump it 
 Lets all get down 
 Feel it in your trunk 
 Let your system bump 
 Yo we gon' move now 
 Lets all get down 
 Hands up in the air 
 Ain't no steppin' there 
 We gon' pump it 
 Lets all get down 
 Feel it in your trunk 
 Let your system bump 
 Yo we gon' end it 
 Lets all get down 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Scramble for cheese, MC's 
 And actors with no fear factor 
 Ill rap you the rapture 
 Turnin' strawberries into Cleopatras 
 Attach your brain 
 With Words of love and pain 
 Fuck above the rim, I'm above the game 
 Getting hugs from dames 
 When I don’t even know their name 
 Just seen what flick they was in 
 As the world and the DJ spins 
 Hittin' Cranberry Blends 
 Girls in the club with their friends 
 Lookin' for men 
 Dancing with each other 
 And treat by the chance that they love us 
 Brothas talkin' in my ear like they got tracks 
 Sistas in my ear talkin' like they got black 
 Movements for me to move with 
 Bad breath mixed with music 
 These good times so let me use it, yo yo 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Refrain x4] 
 Let the poppas pop and the breakers break 
 The hustlas hustle and the shakers shake 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The aesthetic is ultramagnetic 
 B-Boys sweat it, Off 
 With their hats feathered, set it, Off 
 Raw like footage, with no edit 
 In the club, at the bar, Broke headed 
 With my guy who got the block glocked and dreaded 
 I rap, I'm expected to be cheddared 
 This chick rockin' a fur like she want to pet it 
 Better food, somebody should of fed it, the move 
 Ghetto, get eclectic, mellow but yet festered 
 Minds molested by music 
 Good times defuse with buds smoking speakers 
 Run nose thugs quote their favorite song 
 Mind too black and too strong 
 To song and dance 
 We advance to where it don’t stop 
 The pure hip hop…

 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo' 
 We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes 
 The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners

 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 Powder blue profiles glorifying them 
  
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner

 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 Its so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 Its so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners

 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 Powder blue profiles glorifying them 
  
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner

 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 Its so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 Its so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
  
 Hook:

 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill

 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner[Jennifer Hudson] 
 Guess I gotta forget all about this issue 
 And try to live my life just like it is 
 Whooa 
 But I want everyobody to remember me (everybody) 
 I will come back 10 years ago (well, hey) 
 Said I want everybody to remember me 
 When I go back 10 years and years ago 
 When I get my second chance 
 [Lupe Fiasco] 
 When I get my second chance I'm gon redeem myself 
 When I bring myself, me and my team my help 
 Ain't no "I" in that but I'm in that so I am packed 
 So theres ten to millions inside of that 
 Ain't one man army, one man army I am that 
 Bring it back like a typer-writer, writing that 
 I attack like a lightening strike with a lions wrath 
 With a vipers bite come alive with that 
 Put your life on that 
 Like everything I do though 
 All my old wounds have healed but they still feel like they new though 
 And everytime I see 'em I start to think of you yo 
 First I wasn't focused, wasn't willing and my goon's 
 So performance was just lackin at those moments that were crucial 
 Now my heart is razor sharp and confidence is MUCHO 
 Big, things I can't forgive, things I can't forget 
 Things I can't relive, the agony is asking me, defeat is sweet to sin 
 But I put that on my city we will never miss again 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Never miss the city of the wind that I'm in 
 City of the wind that I'm in 
 We can do it now 
 We can do it now 
 We can do it now 
 We can do it we can do we can do it now 
 Second chance, second win, do it again 
 Yeah eah, eeeeah 
 Yeah we do it again 
 We can do it now 
 Lets do it again 
 We can do it now 
 Do it now 
 [Common] 
 The rise of the phoenix, sweat falls 
 Time has it's meaning, I evolve 
 Hit the ground and bounce back up, just like B-Ball 
 Muhammad Ali jaw, I knew that I would be all 
 (?) where I came from, the same place that (?) from 
 My name hung, from the rafters before an aftermath of a master 
 Wishing I could have the moment to grab the trophy and glass of champagne 
 My locker rooms a cold place, LA got no gates 
 You mighta seen this man cry, that was just my old face 
 My soul waits redemption and intervention from a higher dimension 
 Inspire mission, no more hoping or wishing, conditions'll change 
 (?) and say Barack on the range 
 I'm from the Chi' too, now I'm Barack in the game 
 Came back and overcame, overstood the rain 
 More than just the fame, married to the game 
 Now I hold the reign

 So get your rattle rattle thundercloud and broom broom broom 
 Because I gotta gotta get some, el, bow, room 
 So I can Bang-kok, better yet, knock Italy 
 But raindrops keep fallin' on my couch, tryin' to sit with me 
 Tamperin' up my program, I play another slow jam 
 It's not an ancient Chinese secret, you should know man 
 But you insist on stay and playin' Genesis 
 I gotta put an end to this, baldergash, EEE haul ass 
 And don't come knockin' my door, with the cockle-doodle-doo 
 I'm talkin' the his and his and hers (Three's Company too) 
 So step to the step to the rear 
 And don't come back now, hear?

 The CB's, the CB's, they'rrrrre here! 
 I'm checkin' my mirror from the rear - 
 - locks are closer, than they appear 
 The time is near for you to drop your beer and get your nuts in gear 
 But ain't no haps (UH-UH) your dils isn't there 
 You're thinkin' that, "Oops, I made a mistake" 
 You say, "Forget Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break" 
 You made a mistake on the first take 
 Tryin' to break a leg for take two 
 You shoulda ate your Wheaties 
 And Petey mighta made a breakthrough 
 You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position 
 Wishin' he would listen, so you start to kissin' 
 It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline 
 You aimed, you fired, THERE YOU GO, limp again 
 So you take vitamins then play the role of friend and talk 
 Try to tell her it's her fault, but Jack your Bean wouldn't Stalk 
 Baby Bubba youse a goner, ahh, youse a goner 
 It's messed up when Your dils Is Playin' Tricks On Ya 
 So you pop fizz, what a relief, beef, stroke it off, my man 
 Got your thing in your hand, sayin', ("I think I can!") 
 Damn, this never happened before, yeah sure, that's what they all say 
 Uh-oh you better get Maaco, 'cause old girl is salty 
 What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted 
 It's a pop if you pick up your glove and say, ("Yo, I got it!") 
 Hopin' you won't drop, you thought you had it made like Katie 
 What more could go wrong - you got the right one, baby! 
 Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows 
 That you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's

 Catchin' wreck, on the breaker to the 19

 Do fries come with that shake? 
 Rattle and roll, but these are the breaks

 Word is bond, they'll do it, they'll do it 
 That's them c-c-c-c-cock blockers 
 You know the flava, so leave Com' Sense alone, knocka 
 With the cockle, doodle, doo, they want you to stay 
 But I say that you go 
 Slob me up, they robbin' ya, when you try to get your sex on 
 Next you reflect on, the list, yo, I get pissed 
 In the midst of a bone and somebody comes home 
 Now it's like, me, you, and uh, Mrs. Jones 
 Females be waitin' to excel and tell their friends 
 Somethin' bad about the men, yo, I'm gettin' clipped again 
 And that shit is wrong, but it's like, I'm a man, I'm a man 
 So I'ma be a'ight, the...

 Late Show in the house y'all 
 UAC, the true B-boys 
 Professor Not, RMCA y'all, Second Dimension 
 Raider sho' in the house, too intense, check it out 
 Ha ha, it's like that, Chicago, the South Side 
 Comin' outta nowhere to go where, boy, uh!Yeah, this for the people 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin' to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Premo 
 'Ye you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 And the struggles of the brothas and the folks 
 With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes 
 Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder 
 Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr 
 While white folk focus on dogs and yoga 
 My people on the low end tryin to ball and get over 
 Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers 
 From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture 
 Everyday we hustlin, tryin' to get them custom rims 
 Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lustin them 
 Sick and tired of punchin it, I look on the bus at them 
 When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 The people said that I was sharp on TV 
 At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me 
 Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie 
 He said no matter what, the people gonna see me 
 Can't leave rap alone the streets need me 
 Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me 
 Inside peace mixed with beef seem to breed me 
 Nobody believe, until I believe me 
 Now I'm on the rise doin business with my guys 
 Visions realize, music affected lives 
 A gift from the skies, to be recognized 
 I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
  
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana 
 I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama 
 Standin in front of the judge with no honor 
 My raps ignite the people like Obama 
 The karma of the streets is needs and takes 
 Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks 
 Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake 
 Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake 
 The People 
  
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll findYou like to ride (uh) 
 (So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends" 
 "(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends"

 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up 
 Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up 
 Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes 
 You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's 
 But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap 
 Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me 
 'cause five years ago you was so Fugees 
 Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few G's 
 You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah 
 The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita 
 You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia 
 We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia 
 It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya 
 It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah 
 I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda 
 Then I'ma take you to the house+ like +Trick and Trina+ 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

 The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game 
 I give you words spit with flames 
 Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames 
 Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame 
 I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb 
 But my job was to hustle 'dro 
 Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow 
 Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe 
 Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go 
 I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends 
 But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side 
 And I no longer like you 
 Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"

 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 Deep as the ocean is the motion of life 
 Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife 
 Not knowin' you was trife 
 Stiflin' a nigga's growth 
 All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks 
 Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke 
 I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope 
 Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer 
 You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor 
 The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter 
 There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper 
 I look through the mirror and see my reflection 
 It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend 
 Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like West and Kanye 
 Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddammit I'm grown 
 Broke broad I'm a leave your ass alone 
 You still wanna ride though

 Walkin' up and then down the strip 
 Lookin' for some hip so I can skip 
 I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script 
 That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was B-O-Gus 
 So I begin to bust as her friend looked in disgust 
 Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
 Enlist in physical fitness, use your brain and mind your business 
 Dippin' from a distance, in an instance I got the digits 
 And blew a kiss to her 
 (THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her 
 I hooked up with the one that looked NICE 
 Took her mind, like an ICE 
 'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice 
 Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill 
 They told her to keep that booty still 
 I been through more hoes than the pill 
 Still I overcame 'cause I got game like a athlete (UHH) 
 In less than a half week, she was ready to do the nasty 
 The drawers dropped, the top off, and as the boots was gettin' knocked 
 I heard the door unlock, it was her pop, he was a cop 
 So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell 
 Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail 
 Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
 Like a belt, everything was strapped 
 'Til my homey asked, ("WASSUP WIT DAT?") 
 The dat was like dis, see, I told him I got busy 
 This was the spy who dissed me 'cause he told her like a sissy 
 THAT WAS FOUL, I went through more blocks than a mile, now it's a dead end 
 The little red Corvette done locked the door and I can't get in 
 No more no more no more and now I know and now I know 
 Don't mess around with CB's, good buddy, ten-fo' (Ten-fo')

 Down, da, down, check it, check it 
 There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin' to solve 
 Can't understand who the fuck was involved 
 Back from a show, I had came, hopped off the plane 
 In my mind, home was pictured and rest was the frame 
 My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy 
 Go buy them gas and food, was less than a cabby 
 As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built 
 By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled 
 I opened it to the kitchen floor, my heart nailed 
 In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt 
 My mind started swingin' and who I thought the glove fit 
 As usual, niggas is suspects 
 Who did I tell I was going out of town? 
 Not too many people, I guess the word got around 
 The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound 
 Must have came during the day when at work, they was found 
 At the mount, I stand folded than tie askin' who done it 
 Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go wild hunted 
 Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted 
 And left a roach in the ashtray, I had cleaned out the last day 
 Before I left, this thief decided to play chef 
 With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast 
 I'm kickin' what shit was left all around the house 
 Thinkin' whoever came in on me is out 
 It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation, yes, it is 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation, hear me now 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation, yes, it is 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation, hear me, y'all 
 (What can I do?)I'm the C-O to the double M O to the N 
 You heard, motherfucker? Well boy I hit ya again 
 Official bald nigga from the City of Winds 
 Stay doing it, doing it, I am doing it (Repeat 2x) 
  
 What the fuck is going down? Nigga you sound 
 Like a real bitch right now, the pound 
 I gave you I knew I shouldn't have gave you 
 Before you was a hoe now you think the money made you 
 A slave to the rhythm, indentured servant to wisdom 
 Clinton is the pres but I voted for Shelly Chisom 
 In a poetical prison, I'm visiting self 
 For hours, coward niggas get shanked for kicking 
 Pussy raps, radio is like CO's they try to push me back 
 I rip cats out of they suits, give them they hoodies back 
 I from the hood we stack back fist 
 "Ooh ohh ahh" is the sound of blackness 
 These new school cats is classless, influenced by rap shit 
 Front money, but hustle backwards 
 I break bread with broads that got they masters 
 And hypes the blaster, lawyers that work faster than young ghetto bastards 
 Became childlike with the way I style right 
 And act, because children naturally react 
 Respond, to the Com as a poet I'm a last like a Don 
 Cause I'm like that yo, a phenom without shit on my arm 
 You can't coherse a verse 
 I'm a rhyme when I want to get up and rhyme 
 Some say I space like John Glenn because of the places I've been 
 I breaks about spin, been through cases of Heinekin 
 Return to orbit off some shit that's anti-Corbin in the Wild Style 
 On to gain rappers is getting tortured for tossing salads 
 You imbalanced, you rap about violence too much 
 I go on blind dates with my estates and gold dust 
 And at my shows a lot shows up, they think it's a hold up 
 So many hands go up, but with the band I cold up 
 Money folder, you want a fresh style let me show you 
  
 I'm the C-O to the double M O to the N 
 You heard, motherfucker? Well boy I hit ya again 
 Official bald nigga from the City of Winds 
 Stay doing it, doing it, I am doing it (Repeat 2x)You like to ride (uh) 
 (So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends" 
 "(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Would you like to ride? 
 (I don't know what happened, it's just like, heh) 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up 
 Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up 
 Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes 
 You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's 
 But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap 
 Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me 
 'cause five years ago you was so Fugees 
 Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few G's 
 You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah 
 The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita 
 You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia 
 We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia 
 It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya 
 It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah 
 I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda 
 Then I'ma take you to the house+ like +Trick and Trina+ 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name 
 The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game 
 I give you words spit with flames 
 Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames 
 Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame 
 I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb 
 But my job was to hustle 'dro 
 Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow 
 Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe 
 Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go 
 I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends 
 But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side 
 And I no longer like you 
 Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 Deep as the ocean is the motion of life 
 Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife 
 Not knowin' you was trife 
 Stiflin' a nigga's growth 
 All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks 
 Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke 
 I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope 
 Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer 
 You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor 
 The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter 
 There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper 
 I look through the mirror and see my reflection 
 It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend 
 Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like West and Kanye 
 Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddammit I'm grown 
 Broke broad I'm a leave your ass alone 
 You still wanna ride though 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away

 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade

 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be

 It went, honey, check it out, she had me mesmerized 
 With them nice braids and them nice ol' thighs 
 Street poetry, that's my everyday 
 I come to North Sea, yo, on a Sunday 
 So I could say what I can, I ain't in the fog 
 I come to rock it when I come to Den Haag 
 And you should understand why I came to slam 
 Earlier today I was in Amsterdam 
 And later on tonight I'ma be rockin' a party 
 And this is what I do, Com Sense speak godly 
 Somebody out there, yo, they chillin' in the lobby 
 They about to come in, they heart 'riem drummin' 
 We strummin' 'em in with the music 
 People wanna use it, don't confuse it, this ain't for amusement 
 This is for learnin' and burnin' your soul 
 Turnin' the whole road down 
 Constants, yo, I hold down 
 My soul's around for people that need to touch it 
 Understand Com Sense, I love it when I'm rugged 
 And sometimes I get a little softer 
 Never been soft, I'm killin' them, I fill 'em, put in a coffin 
 If I need to, this is what I do, I make it bleed through 
 The whole situation, anticipation 
 Of an album that's coming, it's called Finding Forever 
 And what'll happen when I put my mind together 
 With that, me and my brother named Ye and Jay Dee 
 And plus the 'riem baking is why MC 
 It be the type of brothers that come down with real sound 
 That's what I've been doing 'cause I hold my ill ground 
 And I could tell you, yo, Com been on a mission 
 Lookin' in the front row and I seen this couple kissin' 
 And I knew it was all love when I came in the place 
 I used to have my man Arthur on the bass 
 Maybe he'll come back soon, still I just rap tunes 
 Rap tunes and do what I can, I'm like Black Moon 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says "Don't fuck with Sense"? 
 And this is just one style, yo, money 
 You should understand on the 1 and 2's is Dummy 
 And my nose is runny 'cause I'm cold like that 
 You should understand in my throat I hold my raps 
 And when I spit 'em, I could understand you's a victim 
 To go against it, yo, you get missed with 
 The brother Common Sense, yo, check it out, I invented 
 A different type of style and I stayed centered 
 In this down place where I could often MC 
 Rockin' to the face of the what, the North Sea 
 And yesterday, they say you hot as a stove 
 Yo, they said yesterday my man was Roy Hargrove 
 And he was playing, this is what I'm doing in the place 
 The brother Common Sense coming straight from his face 
 And this is what I do, yo, I could kick a beat again 
 I'll get on the keys like my name was Oscar Peterson 
 But no, that ain't me 
 My name is Rashid, and I could still get on the 88 keys 
 Or Fender Rhodes and I'll kick some soul 
 It's the brother Com Sense...*plays keys* 
 Tryna find a note but I'm fucked up 
 'Cause yo, I was chillin' for a second bein' dope 
 And you should know my rhymes'll float 
 My mind afloat, and this is what I do to provoke 
 A crowd, Com Sense, yo, I love to freestyle 
 Get loud, and I'm from the place called Stony Isle 
 Right in front of the cameras, Derek is the manager 
 I've never been an amateur, I slam at ya 
 If I have to, yo, record this 
 Common Sense, check it out, girls say I'm gorgeous 
 Nah, that ain't the word for it, they say I'm a real nigga 
 If this was slavery days, I'd be a field nigga 
 Or credit, yet a King, Com Sense kick a dream 
 Like Martin Luther, rest in peace to Luther 
 I be the trooper from the city of the Chi 
 And lookin', yo, I'm ready with my eye and I'm ready with the fly 
 I'm fly like the zipper, yo, I be the microphone ripper 
 Back in the days, I acted in ways 
 Like a young B-boy, now I be that B-boy with an album named BE 
 Girls smile at me and say they like that song "Love" and the song called "The Light" 
 I do it right, hittin' ya on a Sunday night 
 Afternoon, Com Sense get in the tune 
 People, yo, you with the camera, you can zoom 
 In and see, how fresh I be 
 It be the Common Sense, used to drink Hennessy 
 Memories going down while I'm giving a pound 
 Com Sense coming from where, yo, the Chi-town 
 I ain't wanna stop, I love the real hip-hop 
 People say hip-hop changed when my shit dropped 
 And they said, "Aw man, your stuff, we love that rap shit" 
 They said, "Common, the album BE's a classic" 
 They gave me 5 Mics and 5 stars, I come do live bars 
 And understand why I'm live, gods 
 Know what time it is when I come up in the place 
 It's Common Sense coming straight from his face 
 And this is what I do for people in the North Sea Festival 
 Yo, I'm still staying on schedule 
 Got a show tonight at the Paradiso 
 And we gon' do what we can just to let loose flows go 
 I see my man in the crowd in amazement 
 This is what we do when you come to the basement 
 You get real placement of real hip-hop 
 Yo, it's like that, my shit don't stop 
 It's like that and you don't stop 
 Relax yourself girl, be so clear 
 Come on, relax yourself girl, be so clear 
 Come on, relax yourself girl, be so clear 
 Relax yourself girl, be so clear 
 Relax yourself girl, be so clear

 Check it 
  
 [Verse] 
 I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left 
 I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef 
 Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection 
 For moms, new steps in a direction 
 In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay 
 Everything a nigga do may not be what he might say" 
 Chicago nights they, stay on the mind 
 I write many lives, they, lay on these lines 
 Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind 
 Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme 
 Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized 
 We got arms but won't reach for the skies 
 Waiting for the Lord to rise, I looked into my daughter’s eyes 
 Realize I’ma learn through her 
 The Messiah, might even return through her 
 If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her 
 Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin ’em 
 Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him 
 The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun 
 Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones 
 Walk like warriors, we were never told to run 
 Explored the world to return to where my soul begun 
 Never looking back, or too far in front of me 
 The present is a gift, and I just want to be... 
  
 And you say North Sea 
 Make some noise 
 Where my peoples at here from Amsterdam? 
 What about Rotterdam? 
 Den Haag? 
 What about the US?Verse 1:(Common) 
 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo' 
 We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes 
 The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 Powder blue profiles glorifying them 
  
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 Its so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 Its so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner{Chorus} 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
  
 {Verse 1} 
 How'd you really get that life 
 Remember when we used to watch nick at nite 
 Saying everything was gonna be alright 
 But then you started selling rocks and smoke at night 
 Man 
 Let me feel alive for a minute 
 Go back a few years, then my world starts spinning 
 We never went to church, so i had no limits 
 Tryna make the best of me with what i was given 
 I was so alone in my room 
 Wishing help was on it's way soon 
 Baby 
 I was five feet below 
 I was underneath the water 
 Underneath the undertow 
 The days start skipping now 
 How ya living? 
 Tryna find my way, tryna learn to start forgiving 
 Every other day, a day that i was missing 
 Every night alone, it's only useless wishes 
  
 {Chorus} 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
  
 {Verse 2} 
 Everything you taught me 
 Everything you wanted 
 Everything you did without me 
 Everything you said 
 Stuck in my memory, even though its faded 
 I still see it cleverly 
 If you do it right the first time you won't get it wrong 
 You're my only son, ima sing it like a song 
 You will grow up and be humble 
 Always take care of your mom 
 If you're feeling down 
 Always stay strong 
 I don't really know what i'm doing 
 Passing time, living in the music baby 
 I've been here for a minute 
 Tryna live my life but there is no winning 
 Tired of being lonely and i feel like quitting 
 Your life is a gift, but life isn't perfect 
 Life isn't gifted, life can be surfaced 
 When we get together 
 (We can get through this) 
 We can get through this 
  
 {Chorus} 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's going 
 How'd you really get that life 
 It's going, it's goingVerse 1:(Common) 
 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo' 
 We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes 
 The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 Powder blue profiles glorifying them 
  
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
  
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 Its so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 Its so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
  
 Hook: 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
  
 (Spoken: The Last Poets) 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the cornerY'all know, we be tryin' our best as men to be faithful, you know 
 We might have our wife or our girlfriend, or the lady we care about in our life 
 And we really be tryna be strong 
 But then we go to these basement parties like this, and it be all these beautiful women out here 
 And we start losing focus, you know what I mean? 
 And then we be tryin' to do good and stuff, and you know 
 You start getting tempted and you see these beautiful ladies 
 Wearing the campers around their neck and stuff, you know 
 Nice striped dresses, very cultural and beautiful, and you start losing it 
 And I know it ain't right, we do gotta do better, men 
 But then again, it's some of y'all ladies that need to get y'all shit together, yeah 
 I ain't sayin' all of y'all, but it's some of y'all 
 You know, 'cause I know this one sista 
 In fact, I know a couple sistas that be like, "Man, I'm in love, man," you know 
 "That's my man right there, that's my boyfriend" 
 Then I see them out with the next brother 
 Where is the love? Where is the respect? What happened? 
 And I know this one sista, man, she did one of my guys real wrong, man 
 She was really bogus 
 She was like, she was ugly bogus, she was like super bogus 
 I'm talkin' 'bout she bogus, man, for real, she straight up bogus 
 I'ma tell y'all about herYou like to ride (uh) 
 (So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends" 
 "(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Would you like to ride? 
 (I don't know what happened, it's just like, heh) 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up 
 Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up 
 Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes 
 You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's 
 But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap 
 Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me 
 'cause five years ago you was so Fugees 
 Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few G's 
 You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah 
 The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita 
 You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia 
 We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia 
 It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya 
 It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah 
 I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda 
 Then I'ma take you to the house+ like +Trick and Trina+ 
  
 Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
 Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away 
 "So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends" 
 "My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends" 
  
 Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name 
 The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game 
 I give you words spit with flames 
 Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames 
 Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame 
 I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb 
 But my job was to hustle 'dro 
 Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow 
 Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe 
 Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go 
 I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends 
 But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side 
 And I no longer like you 
 Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

 Deep as the ocean is the motion of life 
 Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife 
 Not knowin' you was trife 
 Stiflin' a nigga's growth 
 All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks 
 Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke 
 I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope 
 Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer 
 You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor 
 The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter 
 There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper 
 I look through the mirror and see my reflection 
 It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend 
 Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like West and Kanye 
 Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddammit I'm grown 
 Broke broad I'm a leave your ass alone 
 You still wanna ride though

 What I'm really tryin' to say is 
 Come close to me, baby 
 Let your love come through 
 Put your hands in the y'all, it's the basement party 
 I know this world gets crazy 
 What's it without you? 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Are we living in a dream world? 
 Are your eyes still green, girl? 
 I know you're sick and tired of arguing 
 But you can't keep it bottled in 
 Jealousy, we got to swallow it 
 Your heart and mind, baby, follow it 
 Smile, happiness, you could model it 
 And when you feel opposite 
 Yo, I just want you to know 
 Your whole, being is beautiful 
 I'ma do the best I can do 
 Why, 'chelle, 'cause I'm my best when I'm with you 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Common)] 
 Come close to me, baby 
 Let your love hold you 
 (Yo, let your love hold you) 
 I know this world is crazy 
 What's it without you? 
 Nothin', nothin' 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 You've helped me to discover me 
 I just want you to put trust in me 
 I kind of laugh when you cuss at me 
 The aftermath is you touching me 
 Destiny that we connected, girl 
 You and I, we can affect the world 
 Yo, I'm tired of the fast lane 
 I want you to have my last name 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Common)] 
 Come close to me, baby 
 Let your love hold you 
 (Let your love hold you) 
 I know this world is crazy 
 What's it without you? 
 (Yo, sing it with us y'all, take 'em to the bridge) 
  
 [Bridge: Mary J. Blige + (Common)] 
 I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind 
 You're right, (Say what?) you're right, you're right (Yeah) 
 You're running so fast, you just might take flight 
 Hope you're not tired, (When y'all?) tonight, tonight[Intro] 
 A freak freak y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-to the beat y'all, and you don't stop 
 A freak freak y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-to the beat y'all, and you don't stop, come on 
 Freak freak y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-to the beat y'all, and you don't stop 
 A freak freak y'all, and you don't stop 
 I wanna see if y'all up on this hip-hop right here 
  
 [Run's verse from Run-DMC's "Sucker MC's"] 
 Two years ago, a friend of mine 
 Asked me to say some MC rhymes 
 I said this rhyme I'm about to say 
 The rhyme was def but then it went this way 
 Took a test to become an MC 
 And Orange Krush became amazed at me 
 Derek put me inside the Cadillac 
 The chauffeur drove off, where we take 'em to, Dummy? 
  
 [Erykah Badu sample from "Love of My Life"] 
 (Way back) Uh, where we goin' y'all? We go ooh-ooh-ooh 
 (Way back, yeah) Sing it with us y'all, over here, where we goin'? 
 (Way back) Uh, over here, go ooh-ooh-ooh 
 (Way back, yeah) Alright, see if y'all know this 
  
 [Fat Lip's verse from The Pharcyde's "Passin' Me By"] 
 Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian 
 Now the world around me keeps on movin' in slow motion 
 Whenever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye 
 Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? 
 Wait, no, why didn't I pursue my little princess with persistence 
 Was so low key that she's unaware of my existence 
 From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her 
 Wired her a letter, and it went: 
 My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me 
 But I know you very well 
 Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you 
 When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp 
 Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp 
  
 But I'ma take y'all (Way back) 
 Uh, yeah, where goin' y'all? Where goin', come on 
 We go (Way back, yeah) 
 I can't hear y'all, sing it with me Den Haag 
 (Way back) Uh, yeah, uh, it go ooh-ooh-ooh 
 (Way back, yeah) Alright, see, y'all gotta know this 
  
 [Common's verse from "Love of My Life"] 
 Y'all know how I met her 
 We broke up and got back together 
 To get her back, I had to sweat her 
 Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways 
 Boys made her better, to grow, I had to let her, let her 
 She needed cheddar, I understood that (That) 
 Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat (Rat) 
 In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me 
 I love it when she sings to me 
 It's like... 
  
 [Erykah Badu sample] 
 Love of my life 
 Ooh, you know you rock my world and 
 Love of my life 
 You b-boy and I b-girl and 
 Love of my life 
 We don't stop until the break of dawn, ooh... 
  
 Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

 Ah, you can feel it in your throat, ha

 Fuck game, I assemble dope, ha 
 Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the fest 
 Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test 
 Feel it in your chest, ha 
 Your B I's can feel it in her breasts 
 Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced 
 We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us 
 Dreamin' when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild 
 Still doin' this shit like dude in Wild Style 
 Inviting wack brothas to dinner 
 I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga 
 Who can take it where I take it 
 You better goin' to God like Mase did 
 Leaving crowds complacent 
 I move 'em above clouds 
 Whether on some surf and turf shit or thug style 
 Feel it in your body 
 Yeah y'all, feel it in your body, everybody in the party

 We do it like this, that that that this that that 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing 
 I'm writing shit that I feel 
 Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion 
 Motion of Com like that of a ocean 
 Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop 
 By Rakim and $hort, I've been inspired 
 My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's 
 Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it 
 I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham 
 Who say the jam is "money, cash, hoes" 
 I went from bashful to asshole to international, lover of self 
 Word to mother on my new album, it's felt 
 Deal with it y'all 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this 
 I wanna get into it 
 Let’s do this

 (Faithful to the end) Yeah, we got to be 
 (Faithful to the end) Clap your hands y'all, I wanna be 
 (Faithful to the end) 
 (I'd like to be her very best friend) 
 Clap your hands, uh, yeah 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I wrote this song called "Faithful" 
 And what it's about, it's about being faithful to the most high God 
 Creator of all things 
 See, a lot of people ask me about who God is 
 You know, all I know is God created the Heavens and the earth 
 And there's only one God 
 So, I wrote this song thinking about, 'What if God was a woman? 
 How would it be? How would we react? How would I react?' 
 And this is my commitment and my letter to God 
 And I want y'all to check it out and just listen 
 Uh, and just clap your hands and listen, check it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred 
 What if God was a her? 
 Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her? 
 In what type of ways would I want her? 
 Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body? 
 Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly 
 If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex? 
 The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex 
 Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check 
 Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck 
 Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi' 
 Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die 
 Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her 
 Couldn't be jealous, other brothers worship her 
 Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful 
 To be in her presence, yo, I gotta stay... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Faithful to the end) Clap your hands y'all, huh 
 (Faithful to the end) Yeah, yo, we got to be 
 (Faithful to the end) We stay faithful y'all, yes 
 (I'd like to be her very best friend) God bless 
  
 Yo, let me tell y'all this story 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend 
 Even if they don't try, ladies test men 
 This was a test that was bigger than him 
 Some believe it's the nature that is given to men 
 Had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home 
 One reason or another couldn't find peace at home 
 She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?" 
 He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet" 
 "I used to take 'em out to eat, they weren't really eatin' 
 Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'" 
 It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say 
 What you did in the past you live with today 
 She asked if they could spend the night together 
 He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together" 
 Went home to his lady, these were his confessions 
 "Baby, you a blessin' and my best friend" 
 We gotta stay... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Faithful to the end) Go and clap your hands y'all, we got to be 
 (Faithful to the end) Ah, I wanna stay 
 (Faithful to the end) Yes, God bless 
 (I'd like to be her very best friend) Yeah[Verse 1] 
 She walk into the court her knees buckle 
 Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle 
 Seen and been through struggle her whole life 
 Made a transition from being his ho to his wife 
 Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in 
 Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them 
 Looked at the jury, how can they judge him, she screamed 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Before you lock my love away) Put your hands in the air 
 (Before you lock my love away) Yeah, you say 
 (Before you lock my love away) Yeah, it go 
 (Before you lock my love away) 
 (Please let me testify) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Fear in her chest her face in tears 
 Had her man's back he was facing years 
 In her name, though the place was his 
 They tryna take everything except the kids 
 For years she been through stumbling fights 
 He tryna hustle that white 
 Up all night wondering if he's alive 
 Seeing him tried, she bubbled inside and screamed 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up 
 (Before you lock my love away) Keep your hands up 
 (Before you lock my love away) And the people say 
 (Before you lock my love away) 
 (Please let me testify) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The judge yelled for order 
 Court reporter making her words shorter 
 His lawyer sat next to him 
 She could see how the trial was affecting him 
 It hurt for her eyes to connect with him 
 Using her lies for protecting him 
 They arrested him for murder and gun possession 
 As they read back her confessions, she screamed 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Before you lock my love away) Everybody say 
 (Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up 
 (Before you lock my love away) Sing it with us y'all 
 (Before you lock my love away) 
 (Please let me testify) 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff 
 Emotional outbursts, tears and smeared makeup 
 He stated, he was guilty on all charges 
 She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest 
 A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing 
 That's when the prosecutor realized what happened 
 All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying 
 When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Before you lock my love away) Everybody say 
 (Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up 
 (Before you lock my love away) All the ladies say 
 (Before you lock my love away) 
  
 Guilty...next case[Intro] 
 This what they told me to tell you 
  
 [Chorus] 
 So much on my mind, I just can't recline 
 Blast holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine 
 Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine 
 Breathe out, green smoke retrace the skyline 
 Hold up, bass ride out like an ancient mating call 
 I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing 
 Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening 
 This is how we ride... 
  
 [Verse] 
 Yo, on The Amen 
 Corner I stood lookin' at my former hood 
 Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good 
 Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it 
 Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered 
 What what, I choreograph seven steps to Heaven 
 In Hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven 
 Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for 
 What I know or what's known 
 Some days I take the bus home, just to touch home 
 From the crib I spend months gone 
 Sat by the window with a clutched dom 
 Listening to shorties cuss long 
 Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong 
 Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone 
 Dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on 
 Some of this land I must own, outta the city, they want us gone 
 Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes 
 My circumstance is between Den Haag and Love Jones 
 Surrounded by hate, yet I love home 
 Asked my guy how he thought travelling the world sound 
 Found it hard to imagine, he hadn't been past downtown 
 It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep 
 Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep 
 Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep 
 Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Come on, so much on my mind, I just can't recline 
 Blast holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine 
 Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine 
 Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline 
 I heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call 
 I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing 
 Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening 
 We kiss the sky goodbye on the last train leaving 
  
 [Outro] 
 Check it, everybody say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh yeah' 
 Say 'Oh oh yeah' 
 Now scream[Intro] 
 Ah, ah, ah, yo, I'm tryna catch the beat 
 Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat 
 Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat 
 Now, now, now, now, throw your muthafuckin' hands 
 Get 'em high, ah, say what, say what, come on 
 All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man 
 Get 'em high, let me see them hands up high 
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands 
 Keep 'em high, get 'em high, get 'em high 
 And if you're losin' your high then smoke again 
 Keep 'em high 
 Ah, now now now now\ 
  
 [Verse] 
 Get 'em high like noon or the moon 
 Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope 
 Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune 
 I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes 
 Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote 
 Control rap is out of 
 Used to, but still got love 
 That's why I abuse you who are not thugs 
 Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood 
 Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor 
 I stole on live-er niggas than you 
 You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you 
 How could I ever let your words affect me? 
 They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect 
 R-r-r-r-resurrect, r-r-r-r-resurrect 
 I'm here to r-r-r-r-resurrect me 
 R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect 
 R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect 
 R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect me 
 R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrectYo, DJ Dummy, you got something to slow it down with? 
 It's a lotta, like, beautiful ladies out there, man 
 This the time of the party I feel we like, man, we can get cool with the opposite sex, you know? 
 Got a slow joint for the people? 
 We gon' slow it down in the basement party 
 So if you see a nice young lady that you might wanna talk to her 
 Get your courage up right now and start thinking about it 
 This the right jam to play for the ladies 
  
 [Plays Isley Brothers "For the Love of You"] 
  
 I wanna know, I wanna know if I could get one sista to come up here and dance with me 
 One lady, she gotta really feel it though 
 She gotta want it 
 One lady to come up... 
  
 Sing it with us y'all, yeah, unh 
 What's your name? (I'm Michelle) 
 Yeah, where you from? (Los Angeles, United States of America) 
 Give it up, what you doin', you just visiting out here? 
 (Yeah, I came to the festival with my aunt and my friend Ashley) 
 Where your auntie at? (She ain't here) 
 She don't like hip-hop? (She does, she was supposed to be here) 
 Alright, cool, well, we gon' enjoy this real quick, you know 
 Hey, let me tell you, you know it's a lot of beautiful ladies out there 
 What's your name again? I'm sorry (Michelle) *crowd boos* 
 Alright, alright, alright, alright 
 It's a lot of beautiful ladies out there, Michelle, you know 
 But uh, I had to stop for you because... 
  
 [Plays Prince "Adore"] 
 The first moment I say you 
 I knew that you were the one 
  
 And you know, Michelle, usually, I like to take my time 
 But tonight... 
  
 [Plays R. Kelly "Bump N Grind"] 
 I don't see nothin' wrong, oh 
 With a little bump n grind (With a little bump n grind) 
 I don't see nothin' wrong... 
  
 Yo, I got her name right now, y'all 
 I know her name, I know your name nowYou know, for those who don't know about Common 
 You know, I’m an MC that talked about, and talks about love a lot, you know 
 Like I said, in hip-hop, they expect us to only talk about guns and women 
 And just like bitches and all this, you know, and how many diamonds we got 
 But that ain't all we about, so you know 
 When Common came on the scene, I was talking about hip-hop 
 Talking about culture, talking about music, and I talked about 40 ounces, but, you know 
 And that too, but it was more to it than just that, you know 
 It's like music is about love, it’s about God, it's about spirituality 
 And you know, a lot of people had a lot of things to say about me 
 And they was talking about, "Ah, he's soft, man" and you know 
 "He ain't coming with the real hip-hop", you know 
 And, "He going crazy, he doing all these love songs. What's on his mind? 
 What's happening with the boy? What's the matter with the boy? 
 It's a problem with him. He used to be raw hip-hop when he first started 
 Now he’s changing on some other stuff. What’s going on with dude? 
 What's happening with him? Huh? What’s the matter with Common now? 
 Let me know, what's the matter with Common?" 
 That's what they be saying, they hear the boy going crazy...[Intro] 
 But I could give a damn what they say 
 I could give a damn about the things that they say 
 I could give a damn about the things that they say 
 I could give a...you know why? 'Cause... 
  
 [Chorus: John Legend] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (Come on) 
 They say, They say... 
 They don't know 
 (Y'all know what they say, right? You know what they say) 
  
 [Verse 1: Common] 
 Yo, they say a nigga lost his mind 
 But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme 
 The thin line between love and hatred 
 I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life 
 They say life is what you make it 
 So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it 
 As high as the stakes get when paper get low 
 I be tellin' Derek, "Tell Cara get us a show" 
 Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low 
 Richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough 
 They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yeah, that's what they say 
 My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray 
 Paintin' a day, wit' focused crime, broads, and good wine 
 They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes" 
 I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye 
 They never could say - tell 'em, J 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They say "What's happenin'?" 
 We say the facts and if, they lie 
 We comin' back for them 
 They might say... but they don't know! 
 (Come on) 
 They say, They say... 
 They don't know 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 They say "Dude think he righteous" 
 I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers 
 Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is 
 On my paper, whether its weed or Isis 
 They say "life is a game," so I play hard 
 Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job 
 They say "Sef kept the hood together" 
 I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever" 
 Play my cards right, they say I went too left 
 They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F 
 Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights 
 Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White 
 They say my life is comparable to Christ's 
 The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice 
 They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack" 
 Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back"[Chorus] 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop 
 A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I met this girl when I was 10 years old 
 What I loved most she had so much soul 
 She was old school, I was a shorty 
 Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me 
 On the regular, not a church girl, secular 
 Not about the money, studs was mic-checkin' her 
 But I respected her, she hit me in the heart 
 A few New York niggas had did her in the park 
 She was there for me, and I was there for her 
 Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her 
 And just cool out, cool out, cool out and listen to her 
 Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her 
 Eventually if it was meant to be, it would be 
 ‘Cause we related, physically, mentally 
 And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around 
 Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground 
 Original, pure, untampered, a down sister 
 Den Haag, I miss her 
  
 [Interlude] 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop it 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop, come on 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop it 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop, ah 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop it 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop, ah 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop it 
 We gonna rock it, don't stop 
 Now to the ladies and you don't stop, say 'Ow' 
 Homeboys, make some noise, let me hear you say 'Ho' 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative 
 Once dude got to her, altered her native 
 Told her if she got an image, a gimmick, she could make money 
 On the 1's and 2's, this is DJ Dummy 
 See her in commercials, she's universal 
 Ued to only swing it with the inner-city circle 
 She be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie 
 On some bull when she comes to the city 
 Talkin' poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks, hittin' switches 
 Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches 
 Always smokin' blunts, gettin' drunk 
 Tellin' me sad stories, now she only messes with the funk 
 Stressin' how hardcore and real she is 
 Really the realest before she got into showbiz 
 I did her, not just to say I did it 
 But I'm committed (Girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it 
 She's just not the same lettin' all them chumps do her 
 See marks slammin' her, takin' her to the sewer 
 I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop 
 Who I'm talkin' about, y'all? Hip-hop 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop[Intro] 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, yo, get down 
 Go ladies, come on 
 Get down, go ladies 
 Let me hear you say "Ow" 
 Say "Ow" 
 Now, homeboys, make some noise 
 Where my guys? Homeboys, make some noise 
 Let me hear you say "Ho" 
 Say "Ho" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this 
 Gotta be somethin' for me to write this 
 Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute 
 Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it 
 Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together 
 Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever 
 Heart is weathered by what studs did to you 
 I ain't gon' salt 'em, I did it too 
 Because of you, feelings I handle with care 
 Brothas recognize the light, they can't handle the glare 
 Hey, I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts 
 If relationship is effort I will match your work 
 I want to be the one to make you happiest 
 And hurt you the most 
 The end is near, it's important that we close (To the what?) 
 To the most high 
 Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely 
  
 [Chorus] 
 There are times 
 (Sing it, y'all) 
 When you'll need someone 
 (I can't hear you) 
 I will be by your side 
 (Yeah, yeah, let 'em know about the light, y'all, come on) 
 There is a light that shines 
 (How it shine?) 
 Special for you and me 
 (Ah, ah, check it) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's important we communicate 
 And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch 
 I never call you my bitch or even my boo 
 So much in a name and so much more in you 
 Few understand the union of woman and man 
 Sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land 
 Fly by night, for you in the sky I write 
 These cold Chi night's moon, you my light 
 If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall 
 Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all 
 Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall 
 Better or worse times, I hope to me you call 
 I pray every day more than anything 
 Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay 
 Foundation for a family, love ain't simple 
 Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually? 
 We known each other for some time 
 It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine 
  
 [Chorus] 
 There are times 
 (Uh, sing it, y'all) 
 When you'll need someone 
 (I can't hear you) 
 I will be by your side 
 (Yeah, yeah, let 'em know about the light, y'all, come on) 
 There is a light that shines 
 (How it shine?) 
 Special for you and me 
 (Ah, ah, check it) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop 
 Catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop 
 Shit pop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh 
 Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to 
 When I'm lost I try to find you 
 You know to give me space when it's time to 
 My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness 
 Truthfully, it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence 
 The time we committed love, it was real good 
 Had to be for me to arrive, it still feel good 
 Sex ain't gon' keep you 
 But as my equal, it's how I must treat you 
 As my reflection in light I'ma lead you 
 And whatever's right I'ma feed you 
 Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da 
 Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you 
  
 [Chorus] 
 There are times 
 (Ah, ah, sing it, y'all) 
 When you'll need someone 
 (I can't hear you) 
 I will be by your side 
 (Yeah, yeah, let 'em know about the light, Den Haag) 
 There is a light that shines 
 (How it shine?) 
 Special for you and me 
 (Yo, yo, break it down one time for 'em 
 Break it down, come on, yo) 
  
 There are times 
 (Sing it, y'all) 
 When you'll need someone 
 (I can't hear you) 
 I will be by your side 
 (Yeah, yeah, let 'em know about the light, y'all, come on) 
 There is a light that shines 
 (How it shine?) 
 Special for you and me 
 (Ay, ay, y'all sound good, sing it one more here) 
  
 There are times 
 (Ah, sing it, y'all) 
 When you'll need someone 
 (I can't hear you) 
 I will be by your side 
 (Yeah, let 'em know about the light, Den Haag) 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
 (Ah, ah, ah...) 
  
 [Outro] 
 A-get down, go ladies, come on 
 A-get down, go ladies, let me hear you say "Ow" 
 Say "Ow"

 All my guys, homeboys, make some noise, let me hear you say "Ho" 
 Say "Ho"

 God bless you, peaceYo, let's do "Love", man, I wanna do "Love" right now 
  
 One thing we, one thing no matter what walk of life you from 
 In what city you from, or you know, what type of music you do 
 Or what's your profession, one thing in the basement we do is spread love, you know 
 We want love, we love love, and you know 
 Love is the most important thing we can have in this world 
 You know, 'cause God is love, you know 
 And when we talk about love, we're talking about loving ourselves 
 And being able to love God and love others as we love ourselves 
 And love the music we do and hopefully love the things we do in our professions, you know 
 Loving the nature, and loving even your enemies, man 
 It ain't easy but that's what we gotta do 
 When you really love, love is unconditionalYeah, yo. tell me I was diggin' in the crates, man, earlier, man 
 And uh, I had this record I wanted to play for the people in Den Haag 
 'Cause I know they love music, you know? 
 How many of y'all really love music? 
 How many of y'all love hip-hop music? 
 Well, you know, being at this North Sea Jazz Festival, you know a lot of hip-hop comes from jazz 
 So, I was diggin' in the crates, you know, looking for some old jazz greats 
 And I found this joint I wanna play for y'all real quick, hold on... 
  
 Yeah, you ain't the only one that DJ, homie 
 What's goin' on? Play this joint 
 Let the people feel it[Intro] 
 Ah, where my real people at? 
 Yeah, ah, let me see my real people with their hands in the air 
 Wherever you from, real people, let's do it, baby 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin' 
 Often it's beef this city never does 
 People walk and talk in they sleep 
 Cold sweats and wet dreams 
 On how to get green, our faith is all in a jeep 
 Black souls, raw and they deep 
 Hypes tryna talk with no teeth 
 Shorties sayin' ball or retreat 
 A lesson we all speak at one point or another 
 What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother? 
 Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region 
 Through the pain, wish they know that God was just teachin' 
 We want decent homes 
 So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep 'em on 
 It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on 
 I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong 
 Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn 
 Like the Bishop Magic Juan, I write freedom songs 
 For the real people 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Real people in the house, real people, real people check it out 
 Real people know what I'm talking about, it's real people 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie 
 Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me 
 They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi 
 The way they treat Blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi 
 We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs 
 We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge 
 They say the dope game is sour 
 Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours 
 Come to your crib and devour all that you work for 
 Must be more than paper these brothas hurt for 
 Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays 
 Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality 
 Heard that it's drama at home 
 Can a dude break free and still get honored at home? 
 I was told by a chief it's the games nature 
 When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya 
 Yo, it's real people 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Uh, real people in the house, real people know what I'm talking about 
 It's real people, real people in the house, it's real people, it's real people, uhHold on, hold on, Rash 
 We tryna teach them how to rock with hip-hop 
 I understand this is the jazz festival, but come on, man 
 This is not hop-hop 
 Hold on, there's this part on this, it's gon' come, bruh 
 We gon' get 'em rockin' with this, check it out 
  
 Yeah, yo, take that bitch back, Dummy 
 Take it back like this, come on, we go... 
  
 Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder 
 On a quest for love like the Karriem drummer, uh 
 Ah, I strike like lightning and don't need thunder 
 Inhale imagination and breathe wonder 
 Your lady, used to run up in her and G weed from her 
 Dummy just summer, yo, yo 
 Going forward seems like retreat 
 I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats 
 Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets 
 A thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps 
 Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages 
 Third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious 
 Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon 
 Feel Mexican, hip-hop is my garden 
 Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor 
 It ain't that you selling, it's your karma 
 Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large but haven't grown 
 Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone 
 The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy 
 Not for money, coulda sampled Diana Ross a long time ago 
 My mind of flow is like motor key 20 
 Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty 
 Hollering at the brothers, you gon' be a thug or a man? 
 Flip drugs and get land 
 I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him 
 And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him 
 This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming 
 It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here...[Intro] 
 Yeah, they partyin' right now in the North Sea 
 They lovin' how we do it

 From the streets - Get on a beat and go ahh

 On some KRS be here forever type unh 
 You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like unh 
 Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh 
 Baby boy, you could do it, take your time do it... 
 If you get the chance 
 To be a man in a b-boy stance, advanced from the go 
 I'll trace outer space with a unh 
 The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with 
 Bitches and....I've traveled miles with..... 
 I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual 
 Of the real unh 
 Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you 
 You sampled real unh's and then filtered 
 I'm built to last - at last I'm free

 And love is such a great thing, it's a beautiful thing 
 And I want y'all to share that with me 
 Put your L's up in the air if you're in the basement and you love love, yeah 
 Yo, how beautiful love can be 
 Yeah, yeah, I want y'all to get with me on it 
 Put your L's up, yeah, yo, how beautiful, yo, yo, yo... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Yeah, loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Yeah, loving you is loving me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yeah, you know what love is 
 Even found it on the ground where the thugs live 
 My man had to dig deep to find his 
 Couldn't sleep, on the real, he had five kids 
 Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it 
 At crap games, black dames and big faces 
 Cases in court, fam' showing love and support 
 You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport 
 As men we were taught to hold it in 
 That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men 
 If love is a place I'ma go again 
 At least now, now I know to go within 
 At times it can take ya for a spin 
 Heartbreak hotel then you're home again 
 I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend 
 Like a story that he don't want to end 
 Yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Yeah, loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Yeah, loving you is loving me 
 Put them L's up, yo 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Yeah, loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 Ha, gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's all love where we come from 
 In the hood love we was told to run from 
 That same hood where the guns sung 
 We holla love, hoping it'd become one 
 Crack got so many lives undone 
 From lack of love many hide some run 
 I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays 
 Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze 
 Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave 
 Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave 
 Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave 
 Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid? 
 Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade? 
 Heard of the love of money, compassion it pays 
 Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand 
 What it is to be loved by a man 
 And 
  
 [Chorus] 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving you is loving me 
 How beautiful love can be 
 On the streets, love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving you is loving meHip-hop started on the streets of New York with the Black and Latino community 
 And it's gone on to spread across the world, bringing together Blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians 
 People from England, people from Amsterdam, people from Germany 
 People from Ireland, people from Japan, from Africa, from Cuba 
 From where else? Suriname, yes, Suriname, yeah 
 From the Caribbean all over, right? South America 
 Bringing together all people, y'all, all under what we call hip-hop... 
 Now, in the basement, we love hip-hop and we wanna take it forward 
 But in order to move forward, you gotta understand where you come from, you dig? 
 Now, at the North Sea Jazz Festival, we should know 
 We all know that hip-hop got these different elements 
 It's not just rappin', it's different elements 
 You got MCin', you got graffiti, you got breakdancing, B-boying and B-girlin' 
 But the foundation of hip-hop, where it all started is with the DJ

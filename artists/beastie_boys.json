to learn\nAnd for this human body that I know I've earned\nAnd my deepest thanks to all sentient beings\nFor without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing\nThere's nothing here that's not been said before\nBut I put it down now so that I'll be sure\nTo solidify my own views\nAnd I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too\n\nIf others disrespect me or give me flak\nI'll stop and think before I react\nKnowing that they're going through insecure stages\nI'll take the opportunity to exercise patience\nI'll see it as a chance to help the other person\nNip it in the bud before it can worsen\nA chance for me to be strong and sure\nAs I think on the Buddhas who have come before\nAs I praise and respect the good they've done\nKnowing love can conquer hate in every situation\nWe need other people in order to create\nThe circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate\nSituations that bring up our deepest fears\nSo we can work to release them until they're cleared\nTherefore it only makes sense\nTo thank our enemies despite their intent\n\nThe Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength\nA strength from within to go the length\nSeeing others are as important as myself\nI strive for a happiness of mental wealth\nWith the interconnectedness that we share as one\nEvery action that we take affects everyone\nSo in deciding for what a situation calls\nThere is a path for the good for all\nI try to make my every action for that highest good\nWith the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood\nSo I pledge here before everyone who's listening\nTo try to make my every action for the good of all beings\nFor the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond\nI vow to do my best, to do no harm\nAnd in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma\nAnd the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara", "Jimmy James": "[MCA] People how you doin', there's a new day dawnin'\n[MD] For the earth mother, it's a brand new mornin'\n[AD] For such a long while,

(\u201cGoldieBlox\u201d), Brooklyn Dust Music, Beastie Boys and Adam Horovitz (collectively, the \u201cBeastie Boys Defendants\u201d), together with Michael Diamond and Dechen Yauch as executor of the estate of Adam Yauch, deceased (collectively, with the Beastie Boys Defendants, the \u201cBeastie Boys Parties\u201d), aver as follows:\n\n\n...Facts Applicable To All Counterclaims\n11.\tAs an integral part of GoldieBlox\u2019s marketing campaign to sell books and toys that it claims are designed to \u201cinspire the next generation of female engineers\u201d (a profession defined by innovation and original thinking), GoldieBlox has engaged in the systematic infringement of intellectual property from numerous popular music groups, including Beastie Boys.\n\n12.\tAs part of that systematic campaign of infringement, GoldieBlox has created a series of video advertisements set to well-known songs from popular artists in an effort to achieve the company\u2019s primary goal of selling toys.\n\n13.\tUpon information and belief, GoldieBlox has produced and published videos that infringe upon popular songs by Beastie Boys, Queen, Daft Punk, Kaskade, Krewella, Avicii, Slam, k.flay and Trevor Guthrie.\n\n14.\tIn some instances, GoldieBlox has altered the lyrics of the popular songs featured in its video advertisements in order to tailor those songs to the company\u2019s goal of selling toys.\n\n15.\tOne of the popular songs that GoldieBlox altered for use in its video advertisements is \u201cGirls,\u201d the seventh and final single from the Beastie Boys\u2019 1987 debut album Licensed to Ill. \u201cGirls\u201d is a sarcastic anthem.\n\n16.\tUpon information and belief, on or about November 18, 2013 GoldieBlox published a video advertisement entitled \u201cGoldieBlox, Rube Goldberg, & Beastie Boys \u2018Princess Machine\u2019\u201d on its own website and uploaded it to the popular internet video website Youtube.com. (Hereinafter, the \u201cGoldieBlox Advertisement\u201d.) At or around that time, GoldieBlox began promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement through, among other things, its accounts on the social media websites Twitter.com and Facebook.com.\n\n17.\tThe GoldieBlox Advertisement posted on the GoldieBlox website and Youtube.com, as well as substantially all of GoldieBlox\u2019s social media posts promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement, used and explicitly referred to the Beastie Boys\u2019 name and identity.\n\n18.\tThe \u201cBeastie Boys\u201d name and identity is readily associated with Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch, both individually and collectively and have come to signify the musical, artistic, and other creations by Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch individually, as well as collectively under the name \u201cBeastie Boys,\u201d and to identify each of them as individual members of the recording and performing group Beastie Boys.\n\n19.\tThe Beastie Boys Parties are the owners of the common law and registered trademark BEASTIE BOYS\u00ae for use with, among other things, musical sound recordings and video recordings featuring musical performances. The BEASTIE BOYS\u00ae mark is registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as U.S. Reg. No. 4,197,406, and has been in continuous use since 1982. That registration is valid and subsisting under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051, et seq.\n\n20.\tThe GoldieBlox Advertisement is of a commercial nature and used the Copyrighted Work and the BEASTIE BOYS\u00ae mark to advertise GoldieBlox\u2019s products, without any of the Beastie Boys Parties\u2019 consent or authorization.\n\n21.\tThe GoldieBlox Advertisement featured the Beastie Boys musical composition \u201cGirls\u201d with lyrics modified to become a \u201cjingle\u201d to sell GoldieBlox\u2019s products.\n\n22.\tThe GoldieBlox Advertisement promptly became a viral hit on the internet, garnering over 8 million views on Youtube.com alone in just ten days. The GoldieBlox Advertisement also received massive coverage in the press, which primarily focused on its apparently, but not in fact, approved use of the Beastie Boys\u2019 song.\n\n23.\tUpon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement directly coincided with and directly resulted in a massive increase in the sales of GoldieBlox\u2019s products.\n\n24.\tUpon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement and GoldieBlox\u2019s marketing strategy of infringing upon the Copyrighted Work directly resulted in the company\u2019s product line being featured as one of the most popular toy lines for the 2013 holiday season on the internet shopping website Amazon.com.\n\n25.\tUpon information and belief, on or about November 20, 2013, a representative from an advertising agency contacted Universal Music Publishing Group (the administrator of Brooklyn Dust\u2019s and Horovitz\u2019s copyrights in the Copyrighted Work) to ascertain whether GoldieBlox had obtained a license from the Beastie Boys Parties and their publisher or their administrator for the use of the underlying song \u201cGirls\u201d in the GoldieBlox Advertisement. Upon information and belief, the request was made because the advertising agency was in the process of submitting the GoldieBlox Advertisement to a competition, sponsored by Intuit Inc., to win a 30-second television commercial spot during the 2014 Super Bowl.\n\n26.\tOn November 21, 2013, counsel for the Beastie Boys Parties contacted counsel for GoldieBlox to inquire about the company\u2019s use of the Beastie Boys song in the GoldieBlox Advertisement.\n\n27.\tOn that very same day, GoldieBlox filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n28.\tUpon information and belief, GoldieBlox achieved and continues to achieve additional publicity, press coverage, and, upon information and belief, greater sales of its products, as a direct result of the Beastie Boys\u2019 perceived affiliation with the GoldieBlox Advertisement.\n\n29.\tUnfortunately, rather than developing an original advertising campaign to inspire its customers to create and innovate, GoldieBlox has instead developed an advertising campaign that condones and encourages stealing from others.

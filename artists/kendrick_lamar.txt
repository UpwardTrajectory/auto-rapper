[Intro] 
 Nobody pray for me 
 It's been that day for me 
 Waaaaay (Yeah, yeah!) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances 
 Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this 
 Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this 
 D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts 
 Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub 
 Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods? 
 I get way too petty once you let me do the extras 
 Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris 
 A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk 
 Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk 
 If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk 
 If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk 
 My left stroke just went viral 
 Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral 
 Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note 
 It's levels to it, you and I know 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Bitch, be humble (Hol’ up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol’ up, lil', hol’ up, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil’, sit down, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up) 
 Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

 Be humble (Hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up) 
 Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man) 
 Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman) 
 Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right 
 I make a play fucking up your whole life 
 I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop 
 Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor 
 Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks 
 Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks 
 Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy 
 I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy 
 I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy 
 I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy 
 This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy 
 Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy 
 If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy 
 I'm the realest nigga after all 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Hol' up, bitch) 
 Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch) 
 Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)

 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q] 
 If Pirus and Crips all got along 
 They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song 
 Seem like the whole city go against me 
 Every time I'm in the street, I hear— 
 YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Man down, where you from, nigga? 
 Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga? 
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga? 
 This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane 
 This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine 
 This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain 
 Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain 
 It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans 
 It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself! 
 Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance 
 With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed 
 Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out 
 At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out 
 Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it 
 But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different 
 That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine 
 Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime 
 Pack a van with four guns at a time 
 With the sliding door, fuck is up? 
 Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk? 
 Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers 
 Suck a dick or die or sucker punch 
 A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!" 
 That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch 
 Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose 
 You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce! 
 Now crawl your head in that noose 
 You wind up dead on the news 
 Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve 
 Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs 
 Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys 
 When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct 
 Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect 
 They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except 
 When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat 
 You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC 
 Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess 
 M.A.A.d. city 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Man down, where you from, nigga? 
 Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga? 
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga? 
 This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q] 
 If Pirus and Crips all got along

 [Intro: MC Eiht] 
 Wake yo' punk-ass up! 
 It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang 
 G-yeah, real simple and plain 
 Let me teach you some lessons about the street 
 (Smoke somethin', nigga!) 
 Hood ('Sup, Cuz?) 
 It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang 
 G-yeah, how we do 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad' 
 Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad 
 Reality struck, I seen the white car crash 
 Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed 
 My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him 
 Security guard for a month and ended up leavin' 
 In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends 
 To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in 
 Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up 
 Cocaine laced in marijuana 
 And they wonder why I rarely smoke now 
 Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth 
 I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even 
 I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin' 
 You know the reasons but still will never know my life 
 Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice" 
  
 [Interlude: MC Eiht] 
 G-yeah, cocaine, weed 
 Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc 
 Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds 
 Dip, make a nigga flip 
 Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit 
 One time's crooked and shit 
 Block a nigga in 
 Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton 
  
 [Verse 3: MC Eiht] 
 I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool 
 Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules 
 But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang 
 And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang 
 Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me 
 A couple drive-by's in the hood lately, shit 
 Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can 
 Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran 
 Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave 
 Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave 
 Mount up, regulators in the whip 
 Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah 
 Trip, we in the hood still 
 So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah 
 Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand 
 And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me? 
 Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street 
 With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat? 
 If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat? 
 Would you say my intelligence now is great relief? 
 And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep 
 With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor 
 Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage 
 Kill 'em all if they gossip 
 The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option 
 Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins 
 Constantly drinkin' and drive 
 Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye 
 Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide 
 Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes 
 Probably go to the projects, I 
 Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA 
 Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what? 
  
 [Scratches] 
 M.A.A.d city 
 Compton 
  
 [Outro] 
 Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! 
 You ain't the one that got fucked up 
 What you holdin' it for? 
 Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit 
 Nigga, that ain't no word 
 Nigga, shut up! 
 Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? 
 Don't even trip 
 Just lay back and drink that[Produced by T-Minus]

 Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank) 
 Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank) 
 Faded (Drank), faded (Drank) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles 
 Granddaddy had the golden flask 
 Backstroke every day in Chicago 
 Some people like the way it feels 
 Some people wanna kill their sorrows 
 Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem 
 I was in a dark room, loud tunes 
 Lookin' to make a vow soon 
 That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood 
 Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat 
 Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots? 
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock 
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch 
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

 [Verse 2] 
 Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick 
 I am your conscience, if you do not hear me 
 Then you will be history, Kendrick 
 I know that you're nauseous right now 
 And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick 
 If I take another one down 
 I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit 
 I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes 
 I see the feelin', the freedom is granted 
 As soon as the damage of vodka arrived 
 This how you capitalize, this is parental advice 
 Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin' 
 I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots? 
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock 
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch 
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

 I ride, you ride, bang 
 One chopper, 100 shots, bang 
 Hop out, do you bang? 
 Two chopper, 200 shots, bang 
 I ride, you ride, bang 
 One chopper, 100 shots, bang 
 Hop out, do you bang? 
 Two chopper, 200 shots, bang

 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots? 
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

 [Interlude: Sherane] 
 Aw man… where is she takin' me? 
 Where is she takin' me? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 All I have in life is my new appetite for failure 
 And I got hunger pain that grow insane 
 Tell me, do that sound familiar? 
 If it do, then you're like me 
 Makin' excuse that your relief 
 Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf 
 As the window open I release 
 Everything that corrode inside of me 
 I see you jokin', why you laugh? 
 Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep 
 And never ever wake up 
 Never ever wake up, never ever wake up 
 In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough 
  
 [Outro] 
 They stomped the homie out over a bitch? 
 K-dot, you good, blood? 
 Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off 
 That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin' 
 We gon' do the same ol' shit 
 I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways 
 Fall right in ****'s lap 
 And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that 
 And I hope that bitch that set him up out there 
 We gon' pop that bitch too 
 Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody 
 [Car door opens and gunshots are fired] 
 Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good? 
 L****, you good? 
 Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good? 
 Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave? 
 These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother![Verse 1] 
 I got, I got, I got, I got— 
 Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA 
 I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA 
 I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA 
 I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception 
 I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon 
 I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head 
 This that put-the-kids-to-bed 
 This that I got, I got, I got, I got— 
 Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA 
 I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA 
 I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA 
 I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA 
 I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve 
 Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird 
 You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard 
 I know how you work, I know just who you are 
 See, you's a, you's a, you's a— 
 Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA 
 Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA 
 Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA 
 Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge 
 See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front 
 Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son 
 I know murder, conviction 
 Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption 
 Scholars, fathers dead with kids and 
 I wish I was fed forgiveness 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA) 
 Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade 
 When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay 
 At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate 
 And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert 
 And excellent mean the extra work 
 And absentness what the fuck you heard 
 And pessimists never struck my nerve 
 And Nazareth gon’ plead his case 
 The reason my power's here on earth 
 Salute the truth, when the prophet say 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera] 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 I live a be-, fuck your life 
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 
 This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin' 
 Money and power, the maker of marriages 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Tell me somethin' 
 You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin' 
 I'd rather die than to listen to you 
 My DNA not for imitation 
 Your DNA an abomination 
 This how it is when you in the Matrix 
 Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow 
 And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go 
 And sleepin' in a villa 
 Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin' 
 Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors 
 Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window 
 Baby in the pool, godfather goals 
 Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer 
 Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras 
 Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals 
 Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana 
 Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes 
 Phone never on, I don't conversate 
 I don't compromise, I just penetrate 
 Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks 
 These are the times, level number 9 
 Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way 
 Sentence on the way, killings on the way 
 Motherfucker, I got winners on the way 
 You ain't shit without a body on your belt 
 You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate 
 You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself 
 You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate 
 Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate 
 Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith 
 Peace to the world, let it rotate 
 Sex, money, murder—our DNA

 Throw a steak off the ark 
 To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it 
 Leave him in the wilderness 
 With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it 
 Take the gratitude from him 
 I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa 
 I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin' 
 I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin' 
 I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin' 
 I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap 
 Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"

 Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo') 
 Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin 
 Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin' 
 God bless America, you know we all love him 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101 
 Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds 
 He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk 
 Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done 
 He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? 
 It been a fucked up day for me 
 I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome." 
 He was lookin' for some closure 
 Hopin' I could bring him closer 
 To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him 
 "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel: 
 If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed." 
 Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of 
 All the memories collected, moments you could never touch 
 I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block 
 I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got 
 I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap 
 Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!" 
 Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward 
 I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours 
 It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour 
 Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial 
 Let somebody touch my momma 
 Touch my sister, touch my woman 
 Touch my daddy, touch my niece 
 Touch my nephew, touch my brother 
 You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap 
 Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention 
 Call you back—

 Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control

 Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph 
 The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives 
 Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters 
 Barricaded blocks and borders 
 Look what you taught us! 
 It's murder on my street, your street, back streets 
 Wall Street, corporate offices 
 Banks, employees, and bosses with 
 Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office 
 We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again 
 But is America honest, or do we bask in sin? 
 Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood 
 Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood? 
 I'll ask again—oops, accident 
 It's nasty when you set us up 
 Then roll the dice, then bet us up 
 You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us 
 Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera 
 America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

 That's just how I feel 
  
 [Bridge: Anna Wise] 
 Be the last one out to get this dough? No way! 
 Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way! 
 Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way! 
 Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way! 
 Be the last one out to get this dough? No way! 
 Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way! 
 Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way! 
 Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way! 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock] 
 Imagine Rock up in them projects 
 Where them niggas pick your pockets 
 Santa Claus don't miss them stockings 
 Liquors spillin', pistols poppin' 
 Bakin' soda YOLA whippin' 
 Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin' 
 My homeboy just dome'd a nigga 
 I just hope the Lord forgive him 
 Pots with cocaine residue 
 Every day I'm hustlin' 
 What else is a thug to do 
 When you eatin' cheese from the government? 
 Gotta provide for my daughter n'em 
 Get the fuck up out my way, bish 
 Got that drum and I got them bands 
 Just like a parade, bish 
 Drop that work up in the bushes 
 Hope them boys don't see my stash 
 If they do, tell the truth 
 This the last time you might see my ass 
 From the gardens where the grass ain't cut 
 Them serpents lurkin', Blood 
 Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs 
 But it's all good 
 Broken promises, steal your watch 
 And tell you what time it is 
 Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is 
 In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees 
 Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It go Halle Berry or hallelujah 
 Pick your poison, tell me what you doin' 
 Everybody gon' respect the shooter 
 But the one in front of the gun lives forever 
 (The one in front of the gun, forever) 
 And I been hustlin' all day 
 This-a-way, that-a-way 
 Through canals and alleyways, just to say 
 Money trees is the perfect place for shade 
 And that's just how I feel 
  
 [Outro] 
 K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him! 
 K’s Dad: Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass 
 K’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back! 
 K’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich 
 Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous 
 I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless 
 You don't know what pain is 
 How can I paint this picture 
 When the color blind is hangin' with you? 
 Fell on my face and awoke with a scar 
 Another mistake livin' deep in my heart 
 Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick 
 I can admit that it did look like yours 
 Why you resent every making of this? 
 Tell me your purpose is petty again 
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm tryin' to keep it alive 
 And not compromise the feeling we love 
 You're tryin' to keep it deprived 
 And only co-sign what radio does 
 And I'm lookin' right past you 
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles 
 You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror 
 I know what you scared of 
 The feeling of feeling emotions inferior 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain 
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain 
 Rather a seasonal name 
 I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame 
 On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box 
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock 
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!

 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music

 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Outro] 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time 
 Don't you see that long line? 
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth 
 Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync 
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings 
 Now what you better do 
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive 
 My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution 
 Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music 
 I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

 Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!

 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Every second, every minute 
 Man, I swear that she can get it 
 Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high 
 Hands up high, hands up high 
 Tell 'em dim the lights down right now 
 Put me in the mood 
 I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I recognize your fragrance 
 Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit 
 Uh, and I know your taste is 
 A little bit, hmm, high maintenance 
 Uh, everybody else basic 
 You live life on an everyday basis 
 With poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when 
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen 
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em? 
 I really wanna know you all 
 I really wanna show you off 
 Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne 
 Cold nights when you curse this name 
 You called up your girlfriends 
 And y'all curled in that little bitty Range 
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party 
 Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari 
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry 
 They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell 
 But I could never right my wrongs 
 'Less I write it down for real, P.S 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just 
 Know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just 
 Know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright 
  
 [Verse 2: Drake] 
 I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience 
 With all these seductive photographs 
 And all these one-off vacations you've been takin' 
 Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense 
 Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man 
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane 
 Take you and your momma to the motherland 
 I could do it, maybe one day 
 When you figure out you're gonna need someone 
 When you figure out it's alright here in the city 
 And you don't run from where we come from 
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice 
 You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex 
 Your natural hair and your soft skin 
 And your big ass in that sundress, ooh 
 Good God, what you doin' that walk for? 
 When I see that thing move 
 I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more 
 They say communication save relations, I can tell 
 But I can never right my wrongs 
 Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just 
 Know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just 
 Know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Every time I write these words they become a taboo 
 Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true 
 Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof 
 I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe 
 Call me crazy, we can both be insane 
 A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain 
 I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve 
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it 
 Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat 
 It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh 
 Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines 
 Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just 
 Know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song 
  
 [Outro Skit] 
 "I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie 
 Where is you from? Or it is a problem." 
 "Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?" 
 "Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for 
 If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry." 
 "Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay? 
 I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay? 
 You gon' tell me where you from, okay? 
 Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?" 
 "Enough with all this talkin'." 
 "Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"[Produced by Sounwave; Additional production by Terrace Martin] 
  
 [Intro] 
 I got a bone to pick 
 I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers 
 Sittin' in my throne again 
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'? 
 K-Dot back in the hood, nigga! 
 I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin' 
 True friends, one question 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 When you got the yams—(What's the yams?) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The yam is the power that be 
 You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street 
 (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can) 
 I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer? 
 What the fuck happened? (Oh no!) 
 I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars 
 Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell) 
 Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
 And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold 
 Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 When you got the yams—(What's the yams?) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
 24/7, 365 days times two 
 I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage 
 Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah) 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You goat-mouth mammyfucker 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help 
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!" 
 I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too 
 20 million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo! 
 Aw, yeah, fuck the judge 
 I made it past 25, and there I was 
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him 
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
 Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?" 
 Limo tinted with the gold plates 
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah) 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot* 
 By the time you hear the next pop 
 The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot* 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
  
 [Outro] 
 Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk 
 We want the funk

 Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it? 
 We want the funk 
 Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

 I'm on the way 
 We ain't got no time to waste 
 Poppin' your gum on the way (love me) 
 Am I in the way? 
 I don't wan' pressure you none 
 I want your blessing today (love me) 
 Oh, by the way, open the door by the way 
 Told you that I'm on the way (love me) 
 I'm on the way, I know connection is vague 
 Pick up the phone for me, babe 
 Dammit, we jammin' 
 Bad attitude from yo' nanny 
 Curves and your hips from yo' mammy 
 Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera 
 I know Top will be mad at me 
 I had to do it, I want your body, your music 
 I bought the big one to prove it 
 Look what you made 
 Told you that I'm on the way 
 I'm like a exit away, yep

 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

 Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix 
 My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation 
 Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin' 
 Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked 
 And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas 
 Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this 
 Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken 
 All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

 I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir 
 Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher 
 And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure 
 And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed 
 And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record 
 That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her 
 She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin' 
 This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower

 Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress 
 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I roll in dough with a good grind 
 And I run at ho with a baton 
 That's a relay race with a bouquet 
 They say, "K, you goin' marry mines." 
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way 
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay 
 I'm never livin' life confined 
 As I feel you even if I'm blind 
 I can tell you who, what, when, where 
 How to sell your game right on time 
 Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play 
 Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ 
 Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat 
 She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—

 Respect my mind or die from lead shower 
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

 Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
 Alls my life I... 
 Hard times like, "Yah!" 
 Bad trips like, "Yah!" 
 Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
 Homie, you fucked up 
 But if God got us, then we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell Williams]

 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh, and when I wake up 
 I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut 
 But homicide be looking at you from the face down 
 What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down? 
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life 
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
 Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
 Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows 
 Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me 
 Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy 
 No preliminary hearings on my record 
 I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh 
 Tell the world I know it's too late 
 Boys and girls, I think I gone cray 
 Drown inside my vices all day 
 Won't you please believe when I say 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, been down before 
 Nigga, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" 
 Nigga, and we hate po-po 
 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho' 
 Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door 
 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow 
 But we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright

 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What you want you? A house or a car? 
 40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar? 
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall 
 I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal 
 I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
 Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal 
 Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you 
 Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you 
 In the presence of your chico... Ah! 
 I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel 
 If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
 Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all 
 Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all 
 I rap, I black on track so rest assured 
 My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, been down before 
 Nigga, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" 
 Nigga, and we hate po-po 
 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho' 
 Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door 
 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow 
 But we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Huh? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I keep my head up high 
 I cross my heart and hope to die 
 Lovin' me is complicated 
 Too afraid of a lot of changes 
 I'm alright, and you're a favorite 
 Dark nights in my prayers 
  
 [Poem] 
 I remembered you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
 I didn't wanna self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went runnin' for answers[Produced by Boi-1da & Koz] 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar & (Lalah Hathaway)] 
 Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow) 
 I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees) 
 Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God) 
 I want everything black (We don't believe) 
 Everything black, want all things black 
 I don't need black, want everything black 
 Don't need black, our eyes ain't black 
 I own black, own everything black 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Six in the morn', fire in the street 
 Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see 
 And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain 
 It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
 They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
 But homie, you made me 
 Black don't crack, my nigga 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
 Pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me don't you? 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
  
 [Chorus: Assassin] 
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back 
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block 
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
 That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
 Curse me till I'm dead 
 Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head 
 Institutionalized manipulation and lies 
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 You hate me don't you? 
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
 Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
 Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you? 
 How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
  
 [Chorus: Assassin] 
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back 
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block 
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree 
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
 It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
 Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
 That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
 You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
 I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle 
 Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
 Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
 Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score 
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
 Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" 
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
 Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
 Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street 
 When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? 
 Hypocrite!

 Kung Fu Kenny now 
 My resume is real enough for two millenniums 
 A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them 
 I meditate and moderate all of my wins again 
 I'm hangin' on the fence again 
 I'm always on your mind 
 I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line 
 And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind 
 You rollin' with it at the right time, right now 
 (Only for the dollar sign) 
  
 [Verse 2: Rihanna] 
 Bad girl RiRi now 
 Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now

 Gas in the bitch like it’s premium 
 Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane 
 Been a bad bitch way before any cash came 
 I’m established, hundred carats on my name 
 Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I’m alright 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna] 
 I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king 
 Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah) 
 You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah) 
 You can babysit him when I leave him outside 
 Ain’t no other love like the one I know 
 I done been down so long lost hope 
 I done came down so hard I slowed 
 Honestly forever, all a real nigga want 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]

 Feel somethin' wrong 
 You actin' shifty, you don't ride 
 With me no more, I need 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me who you loyal to 
 Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink? 
 Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain? 
 Big chillin', only for the power in your name 
 Tell me who you loyal to 
 Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark? 
 Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start? 
 Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart 
  
 [Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me who you loyal to 
 Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm) 
 Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm) 
 Are you loyal to yourself in advance? 
 I said, tell me who you loyal to 
 Is it anybody that you would lie for? 
 Anybody you would slide for? 
 Anybody you would die for? 
 That's what God for 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar] 
 I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire) 
 All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah) 
 All I want is, all I want is 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna] 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty 
 10-4, no switchin' sides 
 Feel somethin' wrong 
 You actin' shifty, you don't ride 
 With me no more, I need 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty 
 Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

 New Kung Fu Kenny 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth 
 Here we go! 
 I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck 
 I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm willin' to die for this shit 
 I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit 
 Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit 
 D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy 
 I been stomped out in front of my mama 
 My daddy commissary made it to commas 
 Bitch, all my grandmas dead 
 So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy 
 Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin' 
 Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!" 
 I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton 
 I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton 
 I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga 
 I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga 
 We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope 
 That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy 
 If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy 
 I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy 
 They won't take me out my element 
 Nah, take me out my element 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy 
 An imaginary rich nigga, ayy 
 Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy 
 Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy 
 Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy 
 We okay, we let the A1 fly 
 Relocate, jump on the same G5 
 Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah 
 They never been ready, yeah, I know yeah, know yeah

 None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah 
 Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it 
 I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races 
 You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces 
 You know careers take off, just gotta be patient 
 Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic 
 Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy 
 If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

 [Bridge] 
 Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh) 
 Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh) 
 Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame 
 You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh? 
 Niggas thought that K-Dot real life 
 Was the same life they see on TV, huh? 
 Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh? 
 Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh? 
 'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal 
 Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed 
 Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand 
 Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman 
 Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies 
 Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised 
 Last LP I tried to lift the black artists 
 But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri] 
 If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy 
 It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri 
 If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy 
 I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy 
 They won't take me out my element 
 Nah, take me out my element[Part I: "Sing About Me"] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you 
 In case I'm not here tomorrow 
 I'm hopin' that I can borrow 
 A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important 
 My mind is really distorted 
 I find nothing but trouble in my life 
 I'm fortunate you believe in a dream 
 This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine 
 And last night was just another distraction 
 Or a reaction of what we consider madness 
 I know exactly what happened 
 You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help 
 Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel 
 Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up 
 But the type of bullet that stuck 
 Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands 
 My plan's rather vindictive 
 Everybody's a victim in my eyes 
 When I ride it's a murderous rhythm 
 And outside became pitch black 
 A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!" 
 I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck 
 That same mentality I told my brother not to duck 
 In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors 
 I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover 
 The life that I knew as a youngin 
 In pajamas and dun-ta-duns 
 When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs 
 Dumb niggas like me never prosper 
 Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted 
 This Piru shit been in me forever 
 So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever 
 And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did 
 Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big 
 And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You wrote a song about my sister on your tape 
 And called it Section.80 
 The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby" 
 What's crazy was I was hearin' about it 
 But doubted your ignorance 
 How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? 
 Judgin' her past and shit? 
 Well, it's completely my future 
 Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit 
 And I'ma need that forty dollars 
 Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow 
 In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed 
 By a married man, and father of three 
 My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys 
 Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's 
 He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week 
 This is the life of another girl damaged by the system 
 These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em 
 See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em 
 Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim 
 Of a family gene that show women how to be woman 
 Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' 
 Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught 
 Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed 
 And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit 
 My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain 
 If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? 
 I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late 
 And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song 
 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own 
 And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? 
 A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight 
 I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away 
 I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate 
 And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin' 
 I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin' 
 You lyin' to these motherfuckers 
 Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story 
 You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga 
 Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sometimes I look in the mirror 
 And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away? 
 If it's today, I hope I hear a 
 Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon 
 With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus 
 I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin' 
 The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance 
 With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed 
 May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons 
 I suffer a lot 
 And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch 
 I tie my stomach in knots 
 And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death 
 My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats 
 That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful 
 And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch 
 Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death 
 Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest 
 And you're right, your brother was a brother to me 
 And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me 
 In a direction to speak on somethin' 
 That's realer than the TV screen 
 By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between 
 Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told" 
 Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul 
 Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin' 
 Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's 
 I count lives, all on these songs 
 Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong 
 Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong 
 And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone 
 Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn 
 To settle down, my main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh 
  
 [Skit] 
 (On the phone) 
 "Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?" 
 "Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!" 
 "Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga." 
 "Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back." 
 [Hangs up] 
 "Arghh... Fuck! 
 So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?" 
 "Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now" 
 "Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!" 
  
 [Part II: "I'm Dying of Thirst"] 
  
 [Produced by Skhye Hutch] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Tired of runnin', tired of huntin' 
 My own kind, but retirin' nothin' 
 Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin' 
 Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't 
 Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dope on the corner, look at the coroner 
 Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her 
 Stray bullets, AK bullets 
 Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't 
 Bring her back, who got the footage? 
 Channel 9, cameras is lookin' 
 It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked 
 Banana clip, split his banana pudding 
 I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding 
 I know I'm good at 
 Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 How many sins? I'm runnin' out 
 How many sins? I lost count 
 Dreams of ballin' like Spalding 
 But only shotty bounce 
 The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth 
 Money is power (Money is power) 
 Yours is ours (Yours is ours) 
 Lay with a snitch, die with a coward 
 Hope we get rich, hope we can tower 
 Over the city with vanity with the music louder 
 The same song, a black flower 
 I'll show you how to 
 Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'? 
 Hell is hot, fire is proven 
 To burn for eternity, return of the student 
 That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it 
 Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin' 
 Tell us to visit, we lie about comin' 
 Now back to business, loadin' the guns in 
 Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin' 
 The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion 
 Hereditary, all of my cousins 
 Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst 
  
 [Verse 5] 
 Too many sins, I'm runnin' out 
 Somebody send me a well for the drought 
 See all I know is takin' notes 
 On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke 
 My best days, I stress days 
 (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—) 
 My best days, I stress days 
 Say "fuck the world," my sex slave 
 Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave? 
 Whatever it is, know it's my next grave 
 Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' 
 Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards 
 My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise 
 What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished? 
 The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest 
 You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst 
 So hop in that water, and pray that it works." 
  
 [Skit/Outro] 
 Fuck! I’m tired of this shit! 
 I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit! 
 That’s my brother, homie! 
 Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is? 
 I know that's not what I think that is 
 Why are you so angry? 
 See, you young men are dying of thirst 
 Do you know what that means? 
 That means you need water, holy water 
 You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord 
 Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? 
 Okay, repeat after me: 
 "Lord God, I come to You a sinner." 
 (Lord God, I come to You a sinner) 
 "And I humbly repent for my sins." 
 (And I humbly repent for my sins) 
 "I believe that Jesus is Lord." 
 (I believe that Jesus is Lord) 
 "I believe you raised Him from the dead." 
 (I believe you raised Him from the dead) 
 "I would ask that Jesus come into my life." 
 (I would ask that Jesus come in my life) 
 "And be my Lord and Savior." 
 (And be my Lord and Savior) 
 "I receive Jesus to take control of my life." 
 (I receive Jesus to take control of my life) 
 "And that I may live for Him from this day forward." 
 (And that I may live for Him from this day forward) 
 "Thank you, Lord Jesus 
 For saving me with Your precious blood."

 [Intro] 
 Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way) 
 Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon 
 Is the mic on or not? I want the mic 
 We're bringing up nobody, nobody... 
 Nobody but the number one rapper in the world 
 He done traveled all over the world 
 He came back just to give you some game 
 All of the little boys and girls, come up here 
 (One two, one two, what's happening, fool?) 
 Come right here, this is for you, come on up 
 Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother 
 I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
 But an enemigo never drown me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy 
 (I love myself) 
 One day at a time 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street 
 Gun in the hood, mob of police 
 Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh 
 These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front) 
 I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis 
 Dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast 
 Sky could fall down, wind could cry now 
 Look at me motherfucker I smile- 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Illuminated— 
 All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front 
 (I love myself) 
 Baby what about you, come on 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (Crazy, what you gon' do?) 
 Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up 
 (Haunt you) 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
 How many times my potential was anonymous? 
 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this, nigga 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy 
 (I love myself) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet) 
 Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep) 
 (I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) 
 (I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I went to war last night 
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
 I'ma do it till I get it right 
 I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night) 
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message 
 I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave 
 From a negative and letting them annihilate me 
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a building, lay my body... 
  
 [Spoken Interlude] 
 (Offstage Argument) 
 Not on my, not while I'm up here 
 Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time 
 We could save that shit for the streets 
 We could save that shit, this for the kids bro 
 2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog 
 Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost? 
 Yan-Yan, how many we done lost? 
 No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro? 
 This—, this year alone 
 Exactly, so we ain't got time to waste time my nigga 
 Niggas gotta make time bro 
 The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right? 
 The judge make time so it ain’t shit 
 It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog 
 On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that bro 
 You know that 
 It’s mando, right, it's mando 
 And I say this because I love you niggas man 
 I love all my niggas bro 
 Exac— enough said, enough said 
 And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga 
 Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check 
 We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to- 
 All my niggas listen, listen to this: 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga" 
 He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas" 
 No better than Samuel on Django 
 No better than a white man with slave boats" 
 Sound like I needed some soul searching 
 My Pops gave me some game in real person 
 Retraced my steps on what they never taught me 
 Did my homework fast before government caught me 
 So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah 
 On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us 
 So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us 
 Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia 
 N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen 
 N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish 
 The history books overlook the word and hide it 
 America tried to make it to a house divided 
 The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong 
 So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song 
 N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more 
 Black stars can come and get me 
 Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time 
 Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Eight doobies to the face, fuck that 
 12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that 
 Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that 
 Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again 
 Pick him up, then I set him in cold water 
 Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin 
 I hope that take the pain away 
 From the feelin' that he felt today 
 You know, when you part of Section.80 
 And you feel like no one can relate 
 'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner 
 Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger 
 I'm in the house party, trippin' off 
 My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water 
 Never no pancakes in the kitchen 
 Man, not one of our lives is caught up 
 In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end 
 Who gives a fuck? We never do listen 
 'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes) 
 PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul) 
 Lookin' around and all I see 
 Is a big crowd that's product of me 
 And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream 
 Yep, her president is black, she black too 
 Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue 
 She take it straight to the head 
 Then she look at me, she got ADHD 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Eight doobies to the face, fuck that 
 12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that 
 Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that 
 Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist 
  
 [Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it) 
 Whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it) 
 Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (They always told me ADHD did it) 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And then she started… 
 And then she started feelin' herself 
 Like no one else in this apartment 
 "Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby." 
 "How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23 
 "Okay, then we are crack babies." 
 "Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?" 
 "I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax." 
 I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron 
 Made to the back where she reside 
 Then she said, "Read between the lines." 
 Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down 
 And the fact that she just might open up 
 When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know 
 The both of us really deep in the mood now 
 It's nothin' we can do now 
 Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush 
 She looked at me, then looked at it 
 Then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood." 
 "You know why we crack babies? 
 Because we born in the '80s, that ADHD crazy." 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Eight doobies to the face, fuck that 
 12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that 
 Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that 
 Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist 
  
 [Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it) 
 Whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it) 
 Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa 
 (They always told me ADHD did it) 
  
 [Outro: Ab-Soul] 
 You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light 
 Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite 
 Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like 
 You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

 Don't tell a lie on me 
 I won’t tell the truth 'bout you 
 Don't tell a lie on me 
 I won’t tell the truth 'bout you 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Thirty millions later, my future favors 
 The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior 
 Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship 
 Candy-coated, my day shift's 
 Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper 
 Pi equals three-fourteen 
 The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing 
 Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica 
 The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’ 
 Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin' 
 This seed in this soil is classified 
 I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future 
 I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya 
 I done vandalized the industry full circuit 
 The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this 
 Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces 
 The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture 
 The more blood pours, but— 
  
 [Hook] 
 Don’t tell a lie on me 
 I won't tell the truth 'bout you 
 Don't tell a lie on me 
 I won't tell the truth 'bout you 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass 
 And crush ya whole lil' shit 
 I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch 
 Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame 
 And when I get at you, homie 
 Don't you just tell me you was just playin' 
 Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot 
 C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro 
 Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know 
 Might end up like the last nigga I know 
 Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know 
 I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor 
 Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll 
 Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five 
 I am the greatest rapper alive!" 
 So damn great, motherfucker, I've died 
 What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe 
 House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts) 
 A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts) 
 I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga 
 The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears 
 Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere 
 I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers 
 You know what the risk is 
 Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness 
 The whole world gone mad 
 Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash 
 Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad 
 Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab 
 Donald Trump is a chump 
 Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin' 
 And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin' 
 Electorial votes look like memorial votes 
 But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes 
 It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me? 
 I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me 
 But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me 
 How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me? 
 G Malone, big bro, kudos to him 
 I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em 
 Thirty millions later, my future favors 
 The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior 
 Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits 
 You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits 
 Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court 
 A real hustler lose money just to go get some more 
 I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back 
 'Nother classic, right back 
 My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack 
 With TOC, you see the flames 
 In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game 
 And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy 
 My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy 
 Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer 
 Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him 
 Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look 
 You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook 
 Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you 
 Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you 
 Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul 
 They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel 
 Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that) 
 Look at my smile, I'm smirkin' 
 Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!) 
 So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!) 
 So many verses, I never run out (What?) 
 You makin' him nervous, the music is loud 
 Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down! 
 (Sit yo punk-ass down) 
 So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?) 
 So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?) 
 My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?) 
 My name is identified as "That King" 
 I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit 
 A difference between accomplishments and astonishments 
 You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever 
 Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together 
  
 [Outro] 
 Let's get it! 
 Look, look! 
 On foenem[Intro] 
 Poverty's paradise 
 I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth 
 (I've been hungry all my life) 
  
 [Voicemail: Carl Duckworth] 
 What's up, family? 
 Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man 
 I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately 
 And I know you feel like, you know 
 People ain't been prayin' for you 
 But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart" 
 See, family, that's why you feel like you feel 
 Like you got a chip on your shoulder 
 Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way 
  
 [Bridge: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Why God, why God do I gotta suffer? 
 Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle 
 Why God, why God do I gotta bleed? 
 Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet 
 Why God, why God do I gotta suffer? 
 Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka? 
 I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back 
 I beat yo' ass, who bought you that? 
 You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken 
 I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch 
 I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house 
 With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice 
 Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga 
 That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass 
 Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class 
 That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all 
 That TV better not be loud if you got it on 
 Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em 
 Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter 
 Better not hear you got caught up 
 I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father 
 I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin 
 I got buku payments to make 
 County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away 
 I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here 
 I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here 
 Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself? 
 Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up 
 And then I'd take two puffs 
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh) 
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh) 
 Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now 
 (Pull them panties to the side now) 
 I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises 
 I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house 
 I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out 
 I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin' 
 I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches 
 I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused 
 I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool 
 Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra 
 Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate 
 I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges 
 Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin' 
 Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax 
 Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast 
 I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments 
 I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin' 
 I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17 
 All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up 
 And then I'd take two puffs 
 (I've been hungry all my life) 
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh) 
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh) 
 Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now 
 (Pull them panties to the side now) 
 Now 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear 
 Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years 
 My newfound life made all of me magnified 
 How many accolades do I need to block denial? 
 The shock value of my success put bolts in me 
 All this money, is God playin' a joke on me? 
 Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job? 
 Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before? 
 At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all 
 Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall 
 Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin' 
 30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus 
 What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks 
 Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? 
 I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered 
 How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers? 
 The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin' 
 Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' 
 I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck 
 At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged 
 How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city 
 What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me 
 What they see from me would trickle down generations in time 
 What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 
 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness 
 Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive 
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth 
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse 
 Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax 
 Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back 
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth 
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse 
 Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax 
 Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap 
 Damn 
  
 [Bridge: Bēkon] 
 God damn you, God damn me 
 God damn us, God damn we 
 God damn us all 
  
 [Outro: Carl Duckworth] 
 Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." 
 So until we come back to these commandments 
 Until you come back to these commandments 
 We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse 
 Because He said He's gonna punish us 
 The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians 
 Are the true children of Israel 
 We are the Israelites, according to the Bible 
 The children of Israel 
 He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience 
 Because we chose to follow other gods 
 That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee 
 So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you 
 Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised 
 That's why we're in the position that we're in 
 Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments 
 And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us 
 We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live 
 Here, in today, in the United States of America 
 I love you, family, and I pray for you 
 God bless you 
 Shalom[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flow stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your earth and moon 
 You consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
 [Refrain 1] 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan- 
 (one two, one two) 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flow stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your earth and moon 
 You consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
 [Refrain 2] 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
 Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
 If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
 Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? 
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? 
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome 
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing 
 But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question: 
  
 [Refrain 2] 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flow stay propellin' 
 Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that— 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
 You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur? 
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
 You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? 
 Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time? 
 Like who got your best interest? 
 Like how much are you dependent? 
 How clutch are the people that say they love you? 
 And who pretending? 
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in? 
 Do you show forgiveness? 
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? 
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? 
 What kind of bridge did they burn? 
 Revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned? 
 You wanna love like Nelson,  you wanna be like Nelson 
 You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom 
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
 That considered the blessing of everyone 
 This your lesson for everyone, say 
  
 [Refrain 2] 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
 [Chorus 3] 
 The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin' 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon 
 You consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you 
 That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson 
 I went to Robben’s Island analysing, that’s where his cell is 
 So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
 Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
 See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
 Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow 
 Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your X? 
 Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth a bit 
 Pause—put me under stress 
 Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect 
 But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
 How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
 Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
 Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin 
 Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh 
  
 [Refrain 3] 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 That nigga gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those kids? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
 [Chorus 4] 
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flow stay propelling 
 Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 
  
 [Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac] 
 "I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn’t wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city 
 I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man 
 Maybe I’m just another nigga” 
 Shit and that’s all I wrote 
 I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem 
 I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to 
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you 
 I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- 
 About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground 
 What you mean by that, what the ground represent? 
  
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil 
 Right 
 That’s how I see it, my word is bond 
 I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people 
 Right 
 The poor people is gonna open up this whole world 
 And swallow up the rich people 
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat 
 And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing 
 The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like 
 You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be... 
 There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- 
 They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying? 
  
 Aight so let me ask you this then 
 Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich 
 Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? 
  
 I see myself as a natural born hustler 
 A true hustler in every sense of the word 
 I took nothin’, I took the opportunities 
 I worked at the most menial and degrading job 
 And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it 
 I went from having somebody managing me 
 To me hiring the person that works my management company 
 I changed everything, I realized my destiny 
 In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people 
 Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made millions for the record companies 
 I made millions for these movie companies 
 Now I make millions for, for us 
  
 And through your different avenues of success 
 How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 
  
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game 
 And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true" 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying? 
 And it was happening to me for a reason 
 You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit 
 I was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 So it’s no problem, you know 
 I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know 
 I’m finna go straight through 
  
 Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that 
 Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 
  
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance 
 And not only me but, it goes down my family tree 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back 
  
 Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like 
 "We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win 
 And I wanna lay it all down" 
  
 In this country, a black man only have like 
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength 
 And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong 
 While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 
 'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like 
 They take the heart and soul out of a man 
 Out of a black man, in this country 
 And you don’t wanna fight no more 
 And if you don’t believe me, you can look around 
 You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers 
  
 That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings 
 Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that 
 There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you 
 What you think is the future for me and my generation today? 
  
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores 
 And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed 
 For real, I don’t think America know that 
 I think America think we was just playing 
 And it’s gonna be some more playing but 
 It ain’t gonna be no playing 
 It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying? 
 It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen 
  
 That’s crazy man, in my opinion 
 Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations 
 Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know 
 Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic 
 And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out 
 Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes 
  
 Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’ 
 We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 
 Damn 
  
 I wanted to read one last thing to you 
 It’s actually something a good friend had wrote 
 Describing my world, it says: 
 “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it 
 In order to protect itself from this mad city 
 While consuming its environment 
 The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him 
 But praises the butterfly 
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness 
 And the beauty within the caterpillar 
 But having a harsh outlook on life 
 The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak 
 And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 Already surrounded by this mad city 
 The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon 
 Which institutionalizes him 
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 He’s trapped 
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as 
 Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 The result? 
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations 
 That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle 
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different 
 They are one and the same" 
 What’s your perspective on that? 
 Pac? Pac? Pac?![Part I] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Everybody, everybody, everybody 
 Everybody sit yo' bitch-ass down 
 And listen to this true mothafuckin' story 
 Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really I'm a sober soul 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And we ain't askin' for no favors 
 Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really, I'm a peacemaker 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And Momma used to say (say, say, say, say) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (woo) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (you, you, you, you, you, you) 
 One day it's gon' burn you 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
  
 [Part II] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota 
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda 
 Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up 
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor 
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble 
 I hope the universe love you today 
 'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away 
 A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate 
 If it’s necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted 
 Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent 
 The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it 
 Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses 
 Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls 
 And asked them what they workin' with 
 Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth 
 Usually I’m drug-free, but, shit, I’m with the homies 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red 
 Come through and bust ya head, nigga! 
 Me and the homies 
 Sag all the way to the liquor store 
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more 
 Me and the homies 
 I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas 
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in 
 Me and the homies 
 Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka 
 And be like "doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!” 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It’s 2:30 and the sun is beamin' 
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin' 
 Hungry for anything unhealthy 
 And if nutrition can help me 
 I’ll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin' 
 We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester 
 You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses 
 Good Lord, they knew we weren’t from ‘round there 
 ‘Cause every time we down there 
 We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards 
 Bougie bitches with no extensions 
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination 
 Before we sparked a conversation 
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like 
 Then started interrogatin' 
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean 
 I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it 
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it 
 That’s ironic, 'cause I’ve never been violent 
 Until I’m with the homies 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 (Just ridin’, just ridin’) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Trippin’, really trippin’) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had 
 A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad 
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma 
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya 
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience 
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in 
 But Jeezy still playin' 
 And our attitude is still "nigga, what is you sayin'?" 
 Pull in front of the house 
 That we been campin' out for like two months 
 The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want 
  
 [Break] 
 Aye, aye, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
 Aye, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room! 
 Wait, what?! 
 Nigga, there's somebody in this room! 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo 
 DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk 
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right 
 Then made a left, we was just circlin' life 
 My mama called: "Hello? What you doin'?" — "Kickin' it." 
 I shoulda told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense 
 With the homies 
 But – they made a right, then made a left 
 Then made a right, then another right 
 One lucky night with the homies 
  
 [Outro] 
 K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
 Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded 
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though 
 Ooh, which one? 
 Well, which one he talkin' about? 
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it 
 I pray he ain't hit that 
 Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one 
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! 
 Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe 
 Nigga, for what? 
 What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
 "Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!" 
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there 
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street 
 There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go 
 Look, here's the plan, luv 
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park 
 'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight 
 That's what he’s not gon' do 
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30 
 That's straight, but we should meet up around 12 
 I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too 
 Nigga, sit yo' dumb-ass back down! 
 Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight! 
 Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car! 
 We finna get active!

 [Intro: Josef Leimberg] 
 Hit me! 
 When the four corners of this cocoon collide 
 You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive 
 Gather your wit, take a deep look inside 
 Are you really who they idolize? 
 To pimp a butterfly 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 At first, I did love you 
 But now I just wanna fuck 
 Late nights thinkin' of you 
 Until I get my nut 
 Tossed and turned, lesson learned 
 You was my first girlfriend 
 Bridges burned, all across the board 
 Destroyed, but what for? 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool 
 Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room 
 Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies 
 Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey 
 I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on fours 
 Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four 
 Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring 
 Married to the game and a bad bitch chose 
 When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap 
 Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap 
 Take a few M-16s to the hood 
 Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good? 
 I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House 
 Republican run up, get socked out 
 Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck 
 Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that 
  
 [Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton] 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave niggas money 
 Go back home, money, go back home 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave niggas money 
 Go back home, money, go back home 
 (Everybody get out) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat & George Clinton] 
 At first, I did love you (Love you) 
 But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck) 
 Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you) 
 Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut) 
 Tossed and turned, lesson learned 
 You was my first girlfriend 
 Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board) 
 Destroyed, but what for? 
  
 [Break: Dr. Dre] 
 Yo, what's up? It's Dre 
 Remember the first time you came out to the house? 
 You said you wanted a spot like mine 
 But remember, anybody can get it 
 The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What you want you? A house or a car? 
 Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar? 
 Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog 
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall 
 I know your kind (That's why I'm kind) 
 Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine) 
 Pay me later, wear those gators 
 Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters" 
 I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you 
 Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you 
 But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you 
 Because you make me live forever, baby 
 Count it all together, baby 
 Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby 
 Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides 
 So you better cop everything two times 
 Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes 
 Too much ain't enough, both we know 
 Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list 
 Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick 
 And when you hit the White House, do you 
 But remember, you ain't pass economics in school 
 And everything you buy, taxes will deny 
 I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five 
  
 [Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop) 
 Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it) 
 You got a medal for us 
 Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria 
 Look both ways before you cross my mind 
  
 [Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton] 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave niggas money 
 Go back home, money, go back home 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave niggas money 
 Go back home, money, go back home

 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I place blame on you still, place shame on you still 
 Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel 
 Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors 
 Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours 
 But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special 
 What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several 
 Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin' 
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience? 
 Where was your antennas? 
 Where was the influence you speak of? 
 You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
 I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader! 
 I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you! 
 The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
 Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication 
 Thought money would change you 
 Made you more complacent 
 I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 
 I swear— 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof 
 (I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me 
 Yes, I hate you, too) 
  
 [Break: Jessica Vielmas] 
 (Loving you ain't really complicated) 
 Housekeeping, housekeeping 
 (What I got to do to get to you?) 
 ¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!

 ¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
 (Loving you ain't really complicated) 
 ¡Disculpe!

 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You the reason why mama and them leavin' 
 No, you ain't shit, you say you love them 
 I know you don't mean it 
 I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
 Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
 Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
 You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend? 
 You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
 A friend never leave Compton for profit 
 Or leave his best friend, little brother 
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
 Where was your antennas? 
 On the road, bottles and bitches 
 You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven 
 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit 
 Guess you thought he would recover well 
 Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
 Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed" 
 You ain't try 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know your secrets, nigga 
 Mood swings is frequent, nigga 
 I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga 
 I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga 
 Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga 
 And if this bottle could talk, [gulping] I cry myself to sleep 
 Bitch, everything is your fault 
 Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
 Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
 I know your secrets, don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
 And that time you [gulping] I'm 'bout to hurl 
 I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you 
 You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
 Should've killed yo' ass a long time ago 
 You should've feeled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
 And if those mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go" 
 And if I told your secrets 
 The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Everybody put three fingers in the air 
 The sky is falling, the wind is calling 
 Stand for something, or die in the morning 
 Section.80, HiiiPoWeR 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Visions of Martin Luther staring at me 
 Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me 
 I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone 
 Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone 
 You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc 
 You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick 
 Grown men never should bite their tongue 
 Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum 
 I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol 
 Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you 
 My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise 
 How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental 
 This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it 
 You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it 
 And everything on TV just a figment of imagination 
 I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian 
 While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship 
 Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR 
 Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR 
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches 
 I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid 
 You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR 
 Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Visions of Martin Luther staring at me 
 If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy 
 Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek 
 They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh 
 And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh 
 Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh 
 Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard 
 He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs 
 Frightening, so fucking frightening 
 Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill 
 I'm standing on the field full of land mines 
 Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time 
 Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend 
 Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind 
 Who said a black man in the Illuminati? 
 Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party 
 So get up off that slave ship 
 Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR 
 Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR 
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches 
 I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals 
 You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR 
 Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR 
  
 [Bridge: Alori Joh] 
 Every day we fight the system just to make our way 
 We been down for too long, but that's alright 
 We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na 
 Every day we fight the system, we fight the system 
 We fight the system (Never like the system) 
 We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Who said a black man in the Illuminati? 
 Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party 
 Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey 
 On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi 
 And I want everybody to view my autopsy 
 So you can see exactly where the government had shot me 
 No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable 
 They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal 
 Frightening, so fucking frightening 
 Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane 
 The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain 
 Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy 
 Product of the late 80's 
 Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy 
 Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off 
 Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost 
 Cause we been off them slave ships 
 Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR 
 Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR 
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches 
 I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus 
 You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR

 Thug Life! Thug Life! 
  
 [Produced by J. Cole][Intro] 
 Alright, here we go, third take 
 Real quick, Ali, mm 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness 
 Now just imagine the magic I light to asses 
 Don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church 
 (He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die 
 Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind 
 I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined 
 I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline 
 I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine 
 And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky 
 And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply 
 And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite 
 And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride 
 Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die 
 A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide 
 CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite 
 (He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me 
 Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony 
 Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s 
 Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me 
 Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail 
 That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe 
 Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence 
 Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D 
 Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q 
 Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him 
 (He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know 
 (He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA 
 My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor 
 We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster? 
 Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty 
 And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come 
 A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money 
 The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete 
 I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks 
 And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC 
 Really ballistic, anybody can see 
 Any assistance, everybody deceased 
 I'm persistence, recognize I be 
 Really too vicious, the permanent beast 
 And the demolition, breaking up the street 
 Better partition, better dot your T 
 And I gon' mention, how the far you see 
 Putting my dick in the rap industry 
 Everybody bitching, getting mad at me 
 Recognize Kendrick in the battery 
 And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe 
 Is charged up, and the audacity 
 Of y'all fucks never could hassle me 
 And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know 
 (He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know 
 (He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen[Produced By Vinylz] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Dick hard like rottweiler 
 Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo 
  
 [Verse] 
 The whole industry been in shambles 
 Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel 
 Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts 
 Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit 
 I like my raps extra prolific 
 Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches 
 And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training 
 While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous 
 And now we look at the competition as quick submission 
 They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em 
 What this about, is it money or skill? 
 Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real 
 You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable 
 I can see y’all incapable 
 To be the God emcees, you know me well 
 Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister 
 Run for cover, my lineage prove itself 
 I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles 
 Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips 
 We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence 
 Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays 
 It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays 
 I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays 
 It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking 
 Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer 
 Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock 
 And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion 
 Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah! 
 This is what they want, I’m the one 
 This is vintage from 1980 somethin' 
 I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun 
 Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump 
 I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president 
 He probably let me get some head inside the residence 
 I’m in the White House going all out 
 Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans 
 Nothing more influential than rap music 
 I merge jazz fusion with the trap music 
 I mix black soul with some rock and roll 
 They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes 
 Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare 
 My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia 
 A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career 
 Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish 
 A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here? 
 D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California 
 It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him 
 And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him 
 Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me 
 Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign 
 Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them 
 Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them 
 To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them 
 I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’ 
 My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman 
 Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning 
 You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important 
 Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous 
 So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments 
 Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!) 
 I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me) 
 I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole) 
 Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental 
 Every time I start writing I get sentimental 
 This shit is just not fair 
 But why the fuck should I care? 
 The story of your life here 
 Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here 
 Oh Lord, gotta be the yams 
 Billboard list need 2Pac, damn 
 But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah 
 Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance 
 Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me 
 Is not validation, nigga this TDE 
 And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings 
 And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations 
 Whoa 
 Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces 
 Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments 
 I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated 
 I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it 
 My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it 
 I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with 
 The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest 
 Whoa 
 Burnin’ my leather- 
 (Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha) 
  
 [Kayla Duckworth: Laugh][Intro: Bēkon] 
 Love's gonna get you killed 
 But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me 
 And you and you and you and me 
 And you and you and you and me 
 And you and you and you and me and— 
  
 [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 In another life, I surely was there 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 I care, I care 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions 
 Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen? 
 The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em 
 Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question? 
 See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world 
 I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world 
 I don't love people enough to put my faith in man 
 I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band 
 I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around 
 This time I might put you down 
 Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now 
 My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb 
 I’m willing to give up a leg and arm than show empathy from 
 Pity parties and functions of you and yours 
 A perfect world, you probably live another 24 
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure 
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure 
  
 [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 In another life, I surely was there 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 I care, I care 
  
 [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 Maybe I wasn’t there 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive 
 Cold as December but never remember what winter did 
 I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid 
 Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays 
 Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there 
 Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here 
 I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back 
 The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that 
 Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride 
 A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies 
 Promises are broken and more resentment come alive 
 Race barriers make inferior you and I 
 See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches 
 I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison 
 I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service 
 Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world 
  
 [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 In another life, I surely was there 
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care 
 I care, I care 
  
 [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
 Maybe I wasn't there 
 Maybe I wasn't there[Intro: Bēkon & Kid Capri] 
 It was always me vs the world 
 Until I found it's me vs me 
 Why, why, why, why? 
 Why, why, why, why? 
 Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth! 
 We gon' put it in reverse 
  
 [Bridge: Ted Taylor (Sampled)] 
 Darling, I told you many times 
 And I am telling you once again 
 Just to remind you, sweetheart 
 That my— 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Oh, Lamar 
 Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard 
 Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark 
 Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star 
 Life is one funny mothafucka 
 A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him 
 I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep 
 Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep 
 See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects 
 The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect 
 Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot 
 Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals 
 Anthony was the oldest of seven 
 Well-respected, calm and collected 
 Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack 
 A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her 
 His family history: pimpin' and bangin' 
 He was meant to be dangerous 
 Clocked him a grip and start slangin' 
 Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces 
 Even got some head from a smoker last weekend 
 Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie 
 Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him 
 10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily 
 Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies 
 Had a couple of shooters 
 Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin' 
 But witnesses couldn't prove it 
 That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin 
 He beat the case and went back to hustlin' 
 Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang 
 The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang 
 That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came 
 Circlin' parking lots and parking spots 
 And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks 
 Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it 
 He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken 
 See, at this chicken spot 
 There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot 
 With a curly top and a gap in his teeth 
 He worked the window, his name was Ducky 
 He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes 
 Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome 
 Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars 
 They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college 
 Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it 
 Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends 
 Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket 
 'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it 
 Stuck up the place before, back in '84 
 That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war 
 So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works 
 Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious 
 Prevalent proposition with 9's 
 Ducky was well-aware 
 They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year 
 He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides 
 Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line 
 Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide 
 They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive 
 Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives 
 One curse at a time 
 Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why 
 You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments 
 Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it 
 Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again 
 Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits 
 Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident 
 Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence? 
 Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life 
 While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight 
 [Gunshot] 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So, I was takin' a walk the other day…[Produced by Scoop DeVille] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Smokin' weed with you 
 'Cause you taught me to 
 Smokin' weed with you 
 'Cause you taught me to 
  
 [Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Every morning when I wake up, uh 
 Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh 
 Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but 
 Really though, it's never enough 
 10 milli on, that's a must, living in California 
 Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather 
 They come for women, weed and weather 
 For the women, weed and weather 
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather 
 These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that 
 Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that 
 How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and 
 You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise 
 It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess 
 Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimpin' 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever livin' 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre] 
 Women, weed and weather 
 They come for women, weed and weather 
 For the women, weed and weather 
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather 
 Got that women, weed and weather 
 Don't it sound clever, come and play 
 Wh-What more can I say? W-Welcome to LA 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some 
 Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch 
 Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit 
 I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes 
 Ribbon in the sky on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control 
 Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old 
 You want to be on to peak on the charts 
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts 
 She in the coupe, she in the Neon 
 'Cause she on the BS before we can start 
 Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga 
 Let 'em know I'm priority, order me 
 Hennessy and for my niggas 
 OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees 
 Boy he's on his job, boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark 
 Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts 
 Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice 
 No way, hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right 
 We want to be on to peak on the chart 
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts 
 Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault 
 That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimpin' 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever livin' 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre] 
 Women, weed and weather 
 They come for women, weed and weather 
 For the women, weed and weather 
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather 
 Got that women, weed and weather 
 Don't it sound clever, come and play 
 Wh-What more can I say? W-Welcome to LA 
  
 [Verse 3: Dr. Dre] 
 Known for that homegrown where I come from 
 Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun 
 I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion 
 Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion 
 We on it, that mean we living for the moment 
 That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time 
 And I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything, I buy that ocean 
 I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 They want that shit, they often fiend 
 I give it to 'em, but in between 
 My time, I gotta tie shoestrings 
 Life's a trip when you want these things 
 I often slip and then I lean 
 Toward three W's in life 
 You know blow job need an application 
 Eating pussy make appetite 
 And yeah my type, I like 'em brown 
 Just like my drink, the fuck you think? 
 I don't fuck with no hand me downs 
 See if you fuck then it's after me 
 You know how much I'ma make it work? 
 You know her dress livin' in her purse 
 When you discuss your love for lust 
 Just make sure you visit here first - Cali 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You might catch me in Atlanta, looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimpin' 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever livin'

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 How much a dollar really cost? 
 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
 "20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 20 years ago, can't forget 
 Now I can lend him a ear or two 
 How to stack these residuals tenfold 
 The liberal concept of what men'll do 
 "20 on 6," he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
 My American tongue was slurry 
 Walked out the gas station 
 A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion 
 Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land 
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
 He begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
 Told him, "Beat it" 
 Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 
 He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
 Nothin' less, nothin' more" 
 I told him "I ain't have it" and closed my door 
 Tell me how much a dollar cost 
  
 [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] 
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 He's starin' at me in disbelief 
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave 
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 Like I was supposed to save him 
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
 And this particular person just had it down pat 
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 "Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? 
 A humble man is all that we ever need" 
 Tell me how much a dollar cost 
  
 [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] 
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
 I never met a transient that demanded attention 
 They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
 So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum 
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines 
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
 I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind 
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend 
 I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin 
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' 
 I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal 
 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre 
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
 He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
 I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
 He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
 You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power 
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit 
 The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss. I am God" 
  
 [Outro: Ronald Isley] 
 I washed my hands, I said my grace 
 What more do you want from me? 
 Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be 
 Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
 Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs[Produced by Terrace Martin & Larrance Dopson; Additional production by Sounwave]

 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
 Sometimes, I did the same 
 (Woman moaning) 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk- 
 Sex 
  
 [Bridge: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar] 
 She just want to close her eyes and sway 
 With you, with you, with you 
 Exercise her right to work it out 
 It's true, it's true, it's true 
 Shout out to the birthday girls 
 Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl) 
 Everyone deserves a night to play (Play) 
 She plays, only when you tell her no 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal] 
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good 
 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me, I’m just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I’m here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around, demolition might crush 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal] 
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep 
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I’ve been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
 I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em 
 I’d rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal] 
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
 [Instrumental Break] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late 
 Your destiny, accept it, your fate 
 Burn accessories and stash them on the yard 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening, no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper 
 Walls can talk (Talk) 
  
 [Poem: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusin' your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusin' my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screamin' in a hotel room[Produced by Tae Beast, Sounwave & Thundercat] 
  
 [Intro] 
 K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga 
 Every time I call, it's going to voicemail 
 Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga? 
 No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha 
 Call me on Shaniqua's phone! 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
 Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo 
 Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo 
 Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo 
 We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce 
 14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies 
 On the dead homies 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga 
 My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga 
 So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga 
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga 
 Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game 
 You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game 
 Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
 Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up 
 Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
 It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this" 
 That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix 
 50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
 El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
 Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you 
 Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
 Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo 
 Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo 
 Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo 
 We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce 
 14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies 
 On the dead homies 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked 
 The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up" 
 Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
 Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
 Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
 Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer 
 Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
 From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around 
 Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans 
 Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'? 
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
 Make it they promise to fuck with you 
 No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?" 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Obama say, "What it do?" 
 Obama say, "What it do?" 
 Obama say, "What it do?"

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
 Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black 
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin' 
 Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
 Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
 Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows 
 No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues 
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
 I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
 Had the Coast on standby 
 “K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
 I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
 Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
 I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
 But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
 He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game" 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo- 
  
 [Poem: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
 I didn't want to self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
 Going back and forth 
 Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war 
 Back in the city 
 I was entering a new one[Produced by Tha Bizness] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Lord God, I come to you a sinner 
 And I humbly repent for my sins 
 I believe that Jesus is Lord 
 I believe that you raised him from the dead 
 I will ask that Jesus will come to my life 
 And be my Lord and Savior 
 I receive Jesus to take control of my life 
 And that I may live for him from this day forth 
 Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood 
 In Jesus' name, Amen 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central 
 She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta 
 Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel 
 I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz 
 "Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome." 
 Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin' 
 Ciara had played in the background 
 The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now 
 "Cool, where you stay?" 
 She said: "Down the street from Dominguez High" 
 Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount 
 "Well, is it Compton?" – "No," she replied 
 And quickly start battin' her eyes 
 And strictly had wanted her thighs around me 
 Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental 
 My motive was rather sinful 
 "What you tryin' to get into?" 
 She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel 
 Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her 
 Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her 
 Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her 
 Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us 
 It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb 
 Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from 
 We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict 
 She live with her granny and her younger two brothers 
 Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible 
 Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical 
 But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut 
 "I wanna come over, what's up?" 
 That's what I told her soon as this episode 
 Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off 
 I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty 
 Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart 
 Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan 
 Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump 
 I got enough to get me through the traffic jam 
 At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man 
 I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs 
 Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next 
 Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts 
 I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette 
 Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse 
 And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose 
 I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom 
 I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem 
 I'm two blocks away, 250 feet 
 And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street 
 I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see 
 Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang 
  
 [Outro] 
 Please leave your message for 323- 
 Record your message after the tone 
 Kendrick, where you at? 
 Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van 
 You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes! 
 I gotta go to the county buildin', man 
 These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit 
 I gotta get them food stamps, come on now 
 You on you way or what? 
 I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane 
 Plus you got school tomorrow 
 You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade 
 (Is that Kendrick on the phone?) 
 Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes 
 He want to holler at you too 
 Go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit 
 (Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?) 
 Kenny! (What?) You on his voicemail! Damn fool (Oh) Shit! 
 (K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at? 
 This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!) 
 Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn! 
 (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard and squab, homie) 
 Just let me—Kendrick 
 When you get this message, man, call me back 
 I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car 
 This man fussin' about some damn dominoes 
 It ain’t all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes 
 Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck! 
 Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that 
 Nobody wanna hear yo' ass! 
 Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on 
 You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Chelsea Blythe] 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 (Ain't nobody prayin' for me) 
 (Ain't nobody prayin' for me) 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 (Nobody prayin' for me) 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 (Ain't nobody prayin' for me) 
 (Nobody prayin' for me) 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I feel like a chip on my shoulders 
 I feel like I'm losin' my focus 
 I feel like I'm losin' my patience 
 I feel like my thoughts in the basement 
 Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated 
 Feel like I don't wanna be bothered 
 I feel like you may be the problem 
 I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world 
 The world is endin', I'm done pretendin' 
 And fuck you if you get offended 
 I feel like friends been overrated 
 I feel like the family been fakin' 
 I feel like the feelings are changin' 
 Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded 
 Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it 
 Feel like I ain't feelin' you all 
 Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved 
 I feel for you, I've been in the field for you 
 It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like— 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 Ain't nobody prayin' 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I feel niggas been out of pocket 
 I feel niggas tappin' they pockets 
 I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it 
 I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants 
 I feel like all of y'all is desperate 
 I feel like all it take is a second to feel like 
 Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic 
 I ain't feelin' your presence 
 Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson 
 Feel like only me and the music though 
 I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual 
 I feel like the enemy you should know 
 Feel like the feelin' of no hope 
 The feelin' of bad dope 
 A quarter ounce manipulated from soap 
 The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom 
 I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison 
 I feel like it's just me 
 Look, I feel like I can't breathe 
 Look, I feel like I can't sleep 
 Look, I feel heartless, often off this 
 Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with 
 Darkest hours, lost it 
 Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin' 
 Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins 
 Fill up the banks with dollars 
 Fill up the graves with fathers 
 Fill up the babies with bullshit 
 Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip 
 I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was 
 The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin' 
 But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper 
 The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons 
 Monsters, false prophets schemin' 
 Sponsors, industry promises 
 Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton 
 Church, religion, token blacks in bondage 
 Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert 
 Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters 
 I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us 
 I can feel it, the dream is more than process 
 I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness 
 I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic 
 I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin' 
 I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em 
 Maybe it's too late for 'em 
 I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em 
 But who the fuck prayin' for me? 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ain't nobody prayin' for me 
 Who prayin' for me? 
 Ain't nobody prayin'[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I need some water 
 Somethin' came over me 
 Way too hot to simmer down 
 Might as well overheat 
 Too close to comfort 
 As blood rush my favorite vein 
 Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's 
 I just need you to want me 
 Am I askin' too much? 
 Let me put the head in 
 Ooh, I don't want more than that 
 Girl, I respect the cat 
 I promise just a touch 
 Let me put the head in, if it's okay 
 She said, "It's okay." 
  
 [Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY] 
 Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now 
 I need everybody's motherfuckin'— 
 Door and his Nike Air Rattles 
 Rush the fire exit, no time for battles 
 Well I, I never expected 
 This that new shit 
 This that new, new shit 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY] 
 Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up 
 Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up 
 Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch 
 Don't go to work today, cop you a fit 
 Or maybe some kicks and make you— 
 Door and his Nike Air Rattles 
 Rush the fire exit, no time for battles 
 Well I, I never expected 
 Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up 
 Watch you a comedy—hol' up! 
 Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up 
 Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up 
 Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today 
 Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today 
 Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama 
 Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window 
 Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden 
 Go to the club or your mama house 
 Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water) 
 Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up 
 Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up 
 Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit 
 Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent 
 Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you 
 Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you 
 Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce 
 It's whatever, just make it count 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I need some water 
 Somethin' came over me 
 Way too hot to simmer down 
 Might as well overheat 
 Too close to comfort 
 As blood rush my favorite vein 
 Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's 
 I just need you to want me 
 Am I askin' too much? 
 Let me put the head in 
 Ooh, I don't want more than that 
 Girl, I respect the cat 
 I promise just a touch 
 Let me put the head in, if it's okay 
 She said, "It's okay." 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night 
 Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life! 
 Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30 
 Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early 
 Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change 
 Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain 
 Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M 
 Take me a nap and do it again 
 We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news 
 Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true 
 All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep 
 None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap 
 Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it 
 Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly 
 Time passin', things change 
 Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways 
 Lust 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame 
 Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame 
 Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (lately) 
 Lately, it’s all contradiction 
 Lately, I’m not here 
 Lately, I lust over self 
 Lust turn into fear 
 Lately, in James 4:4 says 
 Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord 
 Brace yourself, lust is all yours 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I need some water 
 Somethin' came over me 
 Way too high to simmer down 
 Might as well overheat 
 Too close to comfort 
 As blood rush my favorite vein 
 Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's 
 I just need you to want me 
 Am I askin' too much? 
 Let me put the head in 
 Ooh, I don't want more than that 
 Girl, I respect the cat 
 I promise just a touch 
 Let me put the head in, if it's okay 
 She said, "It's okay."[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look inside of my soul 
 And you can find gold and maybe get rich 
 Hol' up 
 Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks 
 But now my album platinum and shit, so what? 
 Y'all keep the numbers 
 I'm more than another statistic, my nigga 
 This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton) 
 Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker 
 Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D 
 Dominicans wish that I was born there 
 I'm lookin' to be the god MC 
 You look at my hat and see thorns there 
 I look at the game and see porn there 
 I'm fuckin' this industry hard 
 I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey 
 You thought I was fresh out the yard 
 Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight 
 They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait" 
 Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak 
 And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days 
 And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher 
 But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga 
 I got a P89 in a suitcase 
 I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga 
 Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe 
 Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words 
 To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Up in the clouds, me and my spouse 
 Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud 
 Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think 
 Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink 
 In the White House with a mink 
 Running through that bitch like it's my house 
 All up in the hall like a mall 
 Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball 
 No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to 
 Empty my memory bank 
 It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank 
 Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank 
 Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him 
 I'll wait 
 I've been in my wave like 20 years straight 
 I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight 
 Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high 
 Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie 
 An still be straight (still be straight) 
 Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate 
 Don't waste my breath 
 I don't know how many moons a nigga got left 
 Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point 
 I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno 
 Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off 
 I ministered this generation by far 
 Leader of the new school 
 On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan? 
 World in my palms, ironically 
 I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball 
 Told niggas when I was 16 
 That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen 
 In the paddy wagon with six teens 
 Should have been in the pen 
 But now my pen write with morphine 
 I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends 
 I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket 
 Cardio lap, was running for dear life 
 But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga 
 Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say 
 Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre 
 You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban 
 Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite 
 So many washed up with detergent 
 But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose 
 Like blah, Mini-14 like blah 
 Empty out another magazine like blah 
 Let a young nigga get by (Doot!) 
 I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!) 
 I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got 
 The last that would try to pass a good job 
 If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo 
 Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah![Intro] 
 Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!) 
 Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!) 
 (Hooray!) 
 Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!) 
 Pimp-pimp! 
  
 [Bridge 1] 
 I'm sick and tired of being tired 
 Can't pick a side, the Gemini 
 Prophesize if we live or not 
 Promise momma not to fear nobody 
 Seen black turn 'em Burgundy 
 Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy 
 Stuck inside the belly of the beast 
 Can you please pray for me? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Get God on the phone 
 Said it won't be long 
 I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams 
 My hood going brazy 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams 
 Get Top on the phone 
 Tell the squad come home 
 We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home 
 World is going brazy 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome 
 Get God on the phone 
 I just got a raise (I just got a raise) 
 Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me) 
 Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised) 
 And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up) 
 Bitch get out the way (Bitch get out the way) 
 I'm the only way, we can fornicate 
 Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah 
 Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah 
 I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah 
 My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie 
  
 [Bridge 2] 
 Seen black turn 'em Burgundy 
 Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy 
 Stuck inside the belly of the beast 
 Can you please pray for me? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Get God on the phone 
 Said it won't be long 
 I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams 
 My hood going brazy 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams 
 Get Top on the phone 
 (What's up, my nigga?) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision 
 All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits 
 Parallel park like an alien came visit 
 Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches 
 Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick 
 (Hello Billy) 
 So many plays on me I finesse 
 Palisade views with some sex 
 I lost a lot of love for missionary 
 This the first time I confess 
 Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil 
 A father figure fuck with him, you get killed 
 Fuck with me and he will kill you himself 
 TDE the mafia of the west 
 Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that 
 Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that 
 I did a lot of dumb shit in my past 
 Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse 
 Dave just bought a new nine eleven 
 Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash 
 Q just bought a brand new McLaren 
 Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects 
 Moosa got his son dripping in gold 
 Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes 
 Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes 
 Top billing that’s a million a show 
 Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul 
 Might tell Obama be more like Punch 
 Sounwave caught a Grammy last year 
 Mack wop, bet he do what he want 
 Fuck you niggas, level two I'm not done 
 2Teez told me that I am the one 
 I can put a rapper on life support 
 Guarantee that's something none of you want 
 Ten homies down and they all serving life 
 What is like twenty-five hundred a month? 
 What if I empty my bank out and stunt? 
 What if I certified all of these ones? 
 Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come 
 Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings 
 You know that you want me come here now lil' baby 
 I'm fuckin, I'm crazy 
 Serving it like I belong in the basement 
 Or live at the Days Inn 
 Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda 
 Pistol and poverty, come get to know us 
 (Get Top on the phone) 
  
 [Outro] 
 Who doing the drums? 
 Man put that nigga on the drums man 
 Yep all day, Mortal Man and Kunta 
 Alright, from the top!

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I got so many theories and suspicions 
 I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions 
 Today is the day I follow my intuition 
 Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches 
 I double parked the Aston in the red 
 My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death 
 My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head 
 My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

 Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions 
 Fox News wanna use my name for percentage 
 My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin' 
 See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!" 
 Yeah, that's the business (uno) 
 Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition 
 I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion 
 I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo' 
 That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo' 
 My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth 
 Said know my worth 
 And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed 
 I know he walks the Earth 
 But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah 
 Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah 
 First on my list, I can't resist, yah 
 Everyone together now, know that we forever—

 [Intro] 
 I wanna hit line drives... 
 Wanna lose weight and keep eating... 
 For you... 
 Hey, whats up doc? 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her 
 You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth 
 To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth 
 I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first 
 The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news 
 Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove 
 You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons" 
 Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar and Gunplay] 
 And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 And I run it (Yeah! Blow!) 
 And I run it (Yeah! Blow!) 
 That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!) 
 Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!) 
 Salt all in my wounds 
 Hear my tears all in my tunes 
 Let my life loose in this booth 
 Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused 
 And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!) 
 And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)

 [Interlude] 
 Liberation... Leader... 
 Popular pie plant pictured here... 
 Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote! 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This shit make a nigga just wanna write 
 Reminisce when I had the morning appetite 
 Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide 
 Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind 
 I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied 
 Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25 
 Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria 
 And that's a covenant I put on every tribe 
 Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe 
 Nobody gon' abide by your rule 
 Nobody holding your gun 
 How come your tongue say killa then kill my mood 
 Light speed living in the world you know 
 Little old me, feeling like a live wire 
 Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt 
 'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote 
 I'm from the bottom of the jungle 
 Living in the bottom of the food chain 
 When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you 
 A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike 
 Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do 
 Things we will never learn soon 
 In the era where we wanna earn soon 
 That's a error, you can smell it in the air 
 And everybody really doomed 
 That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas 
 All y'all can suck my dick 
 All them days at the county building 
 I'm 'bout to make my mama rich 
 Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this (good since!) 
 Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit

 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody 
 Even with a pot to piss in 
 I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge 
 Dismiss any business of yours 
 Discounts never did amount to a check 
 That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce 
 Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car 
 AKs for the whole hood 
 House lick went down perfect 
 Two shots to the head he deserved it 
 I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control 
 Dark Wing Duck lost service 
 Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous 
 Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains 
 I mean don't intervene with no gun machine 
 This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin' 
 Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it) 
 Get a toe tag when you play tag 
 With a task of a new (task force) 
 Everybody wanna know my life 
 Hhow did I make it (past yours) 
 Well let me tell you like this 
 I've been running this shit since I (asked for) 
 Cartoons and cereal 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her

 Hear my tears all in my tunes

 Muhfucka, hope y'all amused! 
 I did wrong, karma came 
 Crackers gave me ball and chain 
 Friends, enemies all the same 
 State, fed, both can hang 
 Nobody can't mute me 
 But I never said nobody can't shoot me 
 Just another stat to the white folks 
 Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely! 
 Everyday feel like the one before 
 Hunt the money, don't hunt the hoe 
 If you do what you always done 
 Then you get what you always got 
 You dumb buffoons! 
 I ain't seen the back of my eyelids 
 For about the past 72 hours 
 Hand on my heart, face to the hood 
 I pledge every word you ever heard was honest 
 Yeah this me, no mic 
 No cameras, no lights, just pain 
 Mama, how much trauma can I sustain? 
 Dirty money come with lots of stains 
 Road to riches come with lots of lanes 
 Just another player with lots of game 
 Never had shit, got lots to gain... 
  
 [Outro: Gunplay] 
 Just another player with lots of game 
 Never had shit, got lots to gain 
 (To Be Continued)[Chorus] 
 This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah 
 Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah 
 Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah 
 You feel some type of way, then a-ha! 
 Huh, he-yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ever since a young man (since a young man) 
 All I wanna be was a gunman (was a gunman) 
 Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man 
 Y'all gotta see that I won, man 
 Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT 
 Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT 
 I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT 
 I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT 
 Look, look… hol' up! 
 Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap 
 Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the rats 
 Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack 
 Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak 
 Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak 
 Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see— 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah 
 Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah 
 Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah 
 You feel some type of way, then a-ha! 
 Huh, he-yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Fuck is you talkin' to? 
 Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to? 
 Slide on you like fallen drapes 
 God toss full of carnivals 
 I kill 'em with kindness 
 Or I kill 'em with diamonds 
 Or I put up like fifteen hundred 
 Get yo' ass killed by the finest 
 Everything in life is a gamble 
 Nothin' in life I can't handle 
 Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more 
 For the cause, I done put blood on sword 
 Everything I do is to embrace y'all 
 Everything I write is a damn eight ball 
 Everything I touch is a damn gold mine 
 Everything I say is from an angel 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit 
 Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift 
 I'm on, I ain't sorry for it 
 Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it 
 I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it 
 I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it 
 I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters 
 Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This what God feel like 
 Huh, he-yeah (this what God feel like) 
 Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!" 
 (This what God feel like) 
 Huh, he-yeah (this what God feel like) 
 Flex on swole like, "A-ha!" 
 (This what God feel like) 
 Huh, he-yeah (this what God feel like) 
 You feel some type of way, then a-ha!

 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 I do what I wanna do 
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I 
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there 
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell 
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell 
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill 
 You're living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A never relay a guarantee 
 And plan C never could say just what it was 
 And your plans only can pan around love 
 You love him, you love them, you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen" 
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
 You love French tip and trip that pay for 
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more 
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself? 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 I do what I wanna do 
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I 
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there 
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone) 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they fell 
 Out the sky and your optics turn stale 
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill 
 Of living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A only can make another mistake 
 And you can't see success coming from plan C 
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely 
 And love them and love when you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old 
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control 
 Of everything that you love, you love beef 
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police 
 You love your hood, might even love it to death 
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself? 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 I do what I wanna do 
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I 
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there 
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone) 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The reason why I know you very well 
 Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? 
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal 
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal 
 When living in a world that come with plan B 
 A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free 
 And plan C just an excuse like "because" 
 Or the word "but," but what if I got love? 
 I love them, I love when I love her 
 I love so much, I love when love hurts 
 I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract 
 I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack 
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch 
 I love what the both of you have to offer 
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else 
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself 
 To the point I should hate everything I do love? 
 Should I hate living my life inside the club? 
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? 
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? 
 Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"? 
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about 
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will 
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real? 
  
 [Skit: Kenny Duckworth] 
 Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise] 
 I do what I wanna do 
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I 
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there

 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone) 
  
 [Skit: Kenny Duckworth and Paula Duckworth] 
 Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom 
 Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

 "If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

 Is it wickedness? 
 Is it weakness? 
 You decide 
 Are we gonna live or die? 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So I was takin' a walk the other day 
 And I seen a woman—a blind woman 
 Pacin' up and down the sidewalk 
 She seemed to be a bit frustrated 
 As if she had dropped somethin' and 
 Havin' a hard time findin' it 
 So after watchin' her struggle for a while 
 I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? 
 "Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance? 
 It seems to me that you have lost something 
 I would like to help you find it." 
 She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something 
 You've lost… your life." 
  
 {Gunshot}

 [Intro: Darlene Tibbs] 
 Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga 
 I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit 
 Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit 
 You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth 
 I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin' 
 I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway 
 I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga 
 You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it 
 Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know 
 Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more 
 You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch 
 My other nigga is on, you off 
 What the fuck is really going on? 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This dick ain't free 
 You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt 
 Like I never made ends meet 
 Eating your leftovers and raw meat 
 This dick ain't free 
 Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary 
 Celery, tellin' me green is all I need 
 Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines 
 This dick ain't free, I mean, baby 
 You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes 
 Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims 
 Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents? 
 Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free 
 I need forty acres and a mule 
 Not a forty ounce and a pit bull 
 Bullshit, matador, matador 
 Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that? 
 Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free 
 Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper 
 Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious 
 Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No 
 Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself 
 Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help 
 This dick ain't free 
 Matter of fact, it need interest 
 Matter of fact, it's nine inches 
 Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business 
 Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents 
 It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings 
 Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion 
 More divorce courts and portion 
 My check with less endorsement left me dormant 
 Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with 
 Fuck you think is in more shit? 
 Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice 
 Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman 
 Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich 
 Now my dick ain't free 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up 
 You ain't no king[Part I] 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What money got to do with it 
 When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
 I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
 Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up 
 Get it back 
 I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
 Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 
  
 [Interlude: Anna Wise and Bilal] 
 If I was the president 
 I'd pay my mama's rent 
 Free my homies and them 
 Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
 Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
 Who ever thought? 
 Master, take the chains off me!

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Life to me, like a box of chocolate 
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it 
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
 K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards 
 You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses 
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
 [Bridge: Snoop Dogg] 
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, God bless the kid 
 Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips 
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor 
 Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for 
 Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this? 
 One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist 
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him 
 Quickly because he got it 
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds? 
 No more livin' poor, meet my four-four 
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
 But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey 
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
 Well, that's me at these awards 
 I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
 She said... 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
 [Outro: Snoop Dogg] 
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, dazed and confused 
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
 You can take your boy out the hood 
 But you can't take the hood out the homie 
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
 Hollywood's nervous 
 Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service[Produced by Pharrell Williams]

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals 
 Of a prisoner on his way 
 Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray 
 Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away 
 I should ask a choir: "What do you require 
 To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?" 
 As the record spin I should pray 
 For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey 
 I got ate alive yesterday 
 I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin' 
 Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue 
 And you understand that I ain't 
 But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble 
 And live in the street with rank 
 No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study 
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
 From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang 
 Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks 
 I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect 
 The good kid, m.A.A.d city

 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight 
 Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help 
 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until 
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will 
 It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still 
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill 
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill 
 All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere 
 As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue 
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof 
 And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo 
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through 
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile 
 I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down 
 Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest 
 He don't mind, he know we'll never respect 
 The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."

 All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms 
 Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane 
 Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain 
 You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change 
 When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain 
 The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms 
 Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose 
 The streets sure to release the worst side of my best 
 Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged 
 Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large 
 Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds 
 What an accomplishment, broken promises 
 Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence 
 The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is 
 You niggas fear me like y'all fear God 
 You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice 
 Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars 
 Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra 
 Before you step out of line and dance with the star 
 I could never end a career if it never start 
 The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies 
 With batteries to the head 
 The flattery of watchin' my stock rise 
 The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size 
 I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid 
 Just premium gas, do it for dolo 
 Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo 
 Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin 
 Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better 
 I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather 
 Forecastin' my future, this is the future 
 The mastermind until my next album, more power to you 
 *Gunshot*

 This is a fifteen minute song (Ahahaha) 
 We're just jammin' out, we on stage 
 Taz, we just jammin' out (Shhh) 
 Hundred thousand (Aw, yeah, aw, shit, hahahaha) 
 Hundred thousand, you gotta see it! 
 Look, look, look, go back to the down note 
 They all sing this shit, everybody

 Now I don't let you down, down for 
 You see, you see, you see, you see (Right) 
 But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh 
 They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth 
 And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold] 
 But head is the answer 
 Head is the future 
 Don't second guess yourself 
 Come on, give me some help 
 Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (Hahahaha) 
 Head is the answer (Yeah) 
 Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said 
 Don't second guess yourself (Crazy, holy shit, hahaha) 
 Come on, give me some help 
 Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on

 I said, girl you make me wanna, uh 
 Great, the—the ho's screaming now, uh (Hahahaha) 
 I said baby you make 
 You make me wanna just, ah! 
 Baby, (Hahahaha) you got me speechless right now 
 (Hahaha, you gotta take it there) 
 I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more 
 Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down 
 To the ground, to the ground 
 Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam 
 Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down 
 To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam 
 And, baby, if your mama's around, if your mama's around 
 If your mama's around, if your mama's around 
 Tell her, tell her 
 No discrimination (Haha), she young nigga chasin' (Ahahah!) 
 And she can get this dick too!

 Oh shit! I need that 
 I need that sloppy, that sloppy 
 Like a Chevy in quicksand 
 Yeah, that sloppy 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This feelin' is unmatched 
 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west) 
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west) 
 Been in it before internet had new acts 
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack 
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision 
 Kendrick is master that mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
 Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
 But what's better than that? 
 The fact it brought me back home 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We been waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know everything 
 I know everything, know myself 
 I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
 I know fatality might haunt you 
 I know everything, I know Compton 
 I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious 
 I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors 
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
 I know everything, I know history 
 I know the universe works mentally 
 I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money 
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery 
 I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies 
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District 
 Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed 
 I know how people work 
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth 
 I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget 
 Until I realized I didn’t know shit 
 The day I came home 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We been waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I met a little boy that resembled my features 
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
 Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted 
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
 He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language 
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous 
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken 
 But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it 
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor 
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 And that was bullshit 
 I know your life is full of turmoil 
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you 
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two 
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace 
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially 
 To come back home" 
  
 [Interlude] 
 This is a world premiere 
 This is a world premiere 
 This is a world premiere 
  
 [Outro] 
 I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite 
 For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
 Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind? 
 Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah! 
 You make me wanna jump 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump 
 Let's talk about love 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump 
 Let's talk about love 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump 
 Let's talk about love 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump 
 Let's talk about love 
 I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite 
 For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
 Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
 Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah! 
 I say, where you at? From the front to the back 
 I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react 
 Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
 When I was seventeen with the .38 Special 
 Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
 Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
 Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway 
 I can be your advocate 
 I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is[Produced by Taz Arnold; Additional production by Sounwave & Terrace Martin]

 I thought you was keeping it gangsta 
 I thought this what you wanted 
 They say if you scared, go to church 
 But remember, he knows the Bible too 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you 
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you 
 'Cause I (want you) 
 Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty 
 Registration is out of service 
 Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving 
 'Cause I (want you) 
 (I want you more than you know) 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby 
 You looked me in my eyes about four, five times 
 'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified 
 That I (want you) 
 You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
 I said, "You crazy?" 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you 
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you 
 'Cause I (want you) 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You said to me, you said your name was Lucy 
 I said, "Where's Ricardo?" 
 You said, "Oh, no, not the show" 
 Then you spit a little rap to me like this 
 When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit" 
 You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said: 
 "My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick 
 Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick 
 Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories 
 About these rappers that I came after when they was boring 
 Lucy gon' fill your pockets 
 Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton 
 Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
 Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me? 
 It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly 
 Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder 
 Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
 I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly 
 Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
 Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
 Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork 
 I want you to know that Lucy got you 
 All your life I watched you 
 And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you 
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you 
 'Cause I (want you) 
 Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty 
 Registration is out of service 
 Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving 
 'Cause I (want you) 
  
 [Poem] 
 I remembered you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
 I didn't wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went runnin' for answers 
 Until I came home[Intro] 
 Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q 
 He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs) 
  
 [Verse] 
 Tire marks, tire marks 
 Finish line with the tire marks 
 When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave 
 Ugh, walking on water and running on waves 
 God MC, oh my God, you gotta see 
 There’s never no I's in me 
 Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away 
 Fire marshal's moving in 
 Marshmallows inside my pen 
 Sweet sixteens 
 Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin 
 I’m so appalled 
 With the prototype with a godly protocol 
 You an amateur, they wanna pro to call 
 I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada 
 I don’t care where ya are 
 Just blink twice and I’m there where you are 
 Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat 
 In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short 
 Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga 
 Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga 
 Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga 
 I had been around niggas, killas, pimps 
 You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch 
 Shoved off the porch when I was like six 
 Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6 
 Kick in the door 
 K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick 
 Momma in the bathroom poppa at work 
 Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church 
 Look at my shirt, Polo on it 
 It’s gon' sell if my logo on it 
 I fear no opponent 
 A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen 
 You looking at the 2010 Romans 
 Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD 
 And I spit like a HK 
 I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G 
 Problem and Hootie nigga 
 Tell the government come shoot me, nigga 
 Cause I’m going out with a fist raised 
 And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade 
 Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade 
 With a democratic politician from CA 
 They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K 
 Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ 
 Give us some free J’s put us in PJs 
 Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way 
 God-Damn, y'all cold 
 Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code 
 Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo 
 Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go 
 Although I’m in the land of milk and honey 
 Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain 
 All the niggas tried to take it from me 
 I had to fight back and shit 
 Take it back and shit 
 And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit 
 Like he back that shit 
 Acting like you real or something 
 Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar 
 Go pop some pills or something 
 You trying real hard to appeal to someone 
 I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub 
 With your BM in it and your stash box glove 
 And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help 
 I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself 
 I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt 
 I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like 
 Bla bla bla bla where the knife at? 
 Cut cut cut where your life at? 
 Your careers over, he’s slumped over 
 And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober 
 That's a new flow 
 Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo 
 New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer 
 Not a rapper, I’m a raptor 
 That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture 
 I’m a factor and your facial 
 I will fracture to a fraction 
 No one-half and I hate math 
 Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon 
 Took me mighty long to get here

 Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
 Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
 Sneak (dissin') 
 Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
 I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down

 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
 Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
 So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
 Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
 Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
 By different shades of faces 
 Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation" 
 It all came from God, then you was my confirmation 
 I came to where you reside 
 And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
 Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey 
 All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave 
 12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark 
 I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas 
 Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid 
 And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!” 
 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored 
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times 
 If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
 It ain’t complex to put it in context 
 Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
 Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
 Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be 
 I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey 
 I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens 
 And spike your self esteem 
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me 
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
 And it’s all beautiful to me 
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Barefoot babies with no cares 
 Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
 I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse 
 The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth[Intro: Ash Riser] 
 We're far from good, not good from far 
 90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard 
 With the top down, screaming "We don't give a fuck!" 
 Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt 
 Cause the kids just ain't alright 
  
 [Interlude: Ab-Soul] 
 Oh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit.. 
 Nigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court building 
 Hope the dogs don't smell it 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Welcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me 
 I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry 
 Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra 
 Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be 
 You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up 
 Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh 
 You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane 
 Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain 
 Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained 
 Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write 
 Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained? 
 To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs 
 AK clips, money clips and gold chains 
 You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's 
 Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar & RZA] 
 Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it 
 Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop 
 Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons) 
 Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop 
 Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons) 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check 
 Spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and 
 In retrospect I remember December being the hottest 
 Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas 
 I tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics 
 Up and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it 
 I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration 
 Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist 
 1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off 
 Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga) 
 He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here) 
 He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch 
 Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger 
 With calendars, cause your date's comin' 
 Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough 
 Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar & RZA] 
 Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with 
 But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it

 Can't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for? 
 Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there 
 When you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win 
  
 [Break: Ab-Soul] 
 Right, I had the yapper, and I tore they ass up 
  
 [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Can't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?

 We really out here, my nigga, you niggas don't understand, my nigga 
 I'm off of pill and Remy Red, my nigga, trippin', my nigga[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup 
 All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck 
 Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall 
 If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all 
 (Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all 
 (Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all 
 (Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Taking off when you landing 
 Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums 
 And I'm dancing on them stars 
 The galaxy ain't got room for y'all 
 Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all 
 While I'm here and every day I hear 
 Your bullshit, self-pity 
 Reason why you never dealt with me 
 Reason why your girl dealt with me 
 Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep 
 R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep 
 That's exactly what this sound like 
 A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up 2 times 
 Then give it right back, don't blow my high 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup 
 All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck 
 Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall

 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look at my life then look at yours 
 Get some ambition, why you bored? 
 Time'll never wait on no man 
 Society will never hold your hand 
 Niggas like the gossip, like bitches 
 Got me thinking you don't like bitches 
 Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans 
 Eyes of a coward, I understand 
 Niggas like the gossip, like bitches 
 Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep 
 R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep 
 That's exactly what this sound like 
 But never will I ever forget Left Eye 
 Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky 
 And a button on your lips, don't blow my high 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup 
 All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck 
 Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall 
 If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all

 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh] 
 Now everybody sing this shit 
 I'm sending him a four-page letter 
 And I enclosed it with a kiss (a kiss) 
 And when I write him, he better 
 Get it on time 
 Look at my life, and look at yours 
 Get some ambition why you bored

 R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said... 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings] 
 (What did the Asian say?) "A peace of mind" 
 That's what the Asian said—I need a divine 
 Intervention was his religion and I was surprised 
 Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God 
 Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time" 
 Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try 
 See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself 
 Worried about your career, you ever think of your health? 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings] 
 (What did the Indian say?) "A piece of land" 
 That's what the Indian said—I needed the man 
 Telling me longevity is in the dirt 
 Should buy some property first 
 Should profit a better dollar with generational perks 
 Equity at his best, really, you should invest 
 These tangible things expire, don't you expect 
 Income with so much outcome and yes 
 Look at my heritage, we blessed 
 (Now, what the black man say?) "A piece of pussy" 
 That's what the black man said I needed to push me 
 To the limit, to satisfy my hunger 
 We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war 
 We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach 
 What you saying to me? 
 He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week" 
 Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night 
 I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings] 
 (What the white man say?) A piece of mine's 
 That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme 
 Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99 
 If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine 
 What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter 
 You make a million or more, you living better than average 
 You losing your core following, gaining it all 
 He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw 
 Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw 
 Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars 
 Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy 
 "I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore 
 Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market 
 If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet 
 A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet 
 Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece" 
  
 [Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin] 
  
 [Hook: Bilal] 
 I holler, "What you do? What you say?" 
 I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today 
 I holler, "What you do? What you say?" 
 I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today 
  
 [Outro] 
 What the black man say? 
 Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die 
 Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply 
 Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die 
 Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply 
 Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die 
 Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply 
 Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die

 [Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up 
 I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes 
 Stay to myself like loners do 
 Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood 
 To politic or be fake with you 
 We apologize if you ever knew 
 Too many niggas, and not enough hoes 
 And most of you niggas, acting like hoes 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Everything I do is too alumni 
 I'ma take my time, I'ma master it 
 You should be mindful of a mastermind 
 Put a landmine right where your momma live 
 Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before 
 See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report 
 That I done you wrong, and I mean you know my home endeavors 
 Nigga right now, it's now or never 
 Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however... 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up

 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick

 Too many niggas, and not enough hoes 
 And most of you niggas, acting like hoes 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre 
 And they wanna tell me, I made it 
 Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout 
 I'ma take his wrist and break it 
 Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here 
 And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear 
 Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate 
 Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up 
 I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes 
  
 [Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q & Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember when I came out and shit 
 Man, it's been so long since they see my dick 
 Probably been five months since I seen my seed 
 Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this? 
 When I was sleeping on couches 
 Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch 
 Nigga I was mothafuckin' out, yeah 
 With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer 
 When I should have been making bank, yeah 
 I was somewhere stuck where the flame is 
 Mothafucka, see how far that I came here 
 Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah? 
 Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride 
 Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind 
 Feel my pain, now I'm styling, Hermès shit, I spent a thousand 
 Different homes, different islands 
 Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album 
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q] 
 Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick (Yeah) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes

 [Chorus: Ash Riser] 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful 
 Lord knows the usual's leaving her body sore 
 She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles 
 Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more 
 She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper 
 Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her 
 And she capture features of a woman, but only 17 
 Then seven cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo 
 Don't care if they Joe Blow 
 If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go 
 And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars 
 She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father 
 That's ironic 
 See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked 
 In her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where 
 Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat 
 Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet 
  
 [Chorus: Ash Riser] 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And Lord knows she's beautiful 
 Lord knows the usual's leaving her body sore 
 Her anatomy is God's temple 
 And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed 
 She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets 
 Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys 
 Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen 
 What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise 
 She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him 
 A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel 
 Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables 
 His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em 
 It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked 
 And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind 
 She made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat 
 'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police 
  
 [Chorus: Ash Riser] 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And Lord knows she's beautiful 
 Lord knows the usual's leaving her body sore 
 As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour 
 She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure 
 Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction 
 At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it 
 Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it 
 But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption 
 That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother 
 For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover 
 10 months before she was 10 he moved in 
 And that's when he touched her 
 This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing to that 
 Block away from Lueders Park 
 I seen the El Camino park 
 And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind 
 She made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat 
 And caught a knife inside the bladder 
 Left for dead, raped in the street 
 Keisha's song 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My little sister 11, I looked her right in the face 
 The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play 
  
 [Chorus: Ash Riser] 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars[Verse 1] 
 I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air 
 Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair 
 If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers 
 They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus 
 Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga 
 Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars 
 I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute 
 Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million 
 And a Comptown fitted 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Yeah, big shit popping — Section.80 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch 
 With my back against the wall 
 And your bitch on the edge of my dick—jump off! 
 I call a bitch a bitch, a hoe a hoe, a woman a woman 
 I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt 
 Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling 
 With the speed of a lightning bolt 
 As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced 
 I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man 
 Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven 
 Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands 
 From a distance don't know which one is a Christian, damn 
 Who can I trust in 2012? 
 There's no one, not even myself 
 A Gemini screaming for help, somebody 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin' 
 When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Yeah, big shit poppin' — 
 Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she popping that ass for 
 The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it 
 They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs 
 She callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him 
 They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain 
 When you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane 
 When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar 
 You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard 
  
 [Chorus 3] 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin' 
 When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up) 
 Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin' 
 When you do it like this, nigga 
  
 [Outro] 
 I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air 
 Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair 
 If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers 
 They'll probably think I'm Osama

 [Skit] 
 Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you... 
  
 [Intro] 
 Now everybody, throw your hands up high 
 If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now I don't give a fuck if you 
 Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit 
 That don't mean shit to me 
 Fuck your ethnicity, nigga 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life 
 Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize 
 Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind 
 What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war 
 My details be retail, man, I got so much in store 
 Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines 
 Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse 
 They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick 
 Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business 
 To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up 
 Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up 
 Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper 
 They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras 
 I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it 
 Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind 
 So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts 
 Everybody, please hold up your wallets 
 Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man? 
 Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you 
 That's starstruck and roast you, oh my 
 HiiiPower 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Reporting live from Planet Terminator X 
 I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now I don't give a fuck if you 
 Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit 
 That don't mean shit to me 
 Fuck your ethnicity, nigga 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all 
 And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements 
 It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off 
 Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved 
 I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus 
 I was kicking that math, dropping that science 
 Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC 
 If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien 
 Don't alienate my dreams, get it right 
 Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do 
 Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back 
 That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you 
 I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her 
 Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower 
 And the power in the people and if they don't believe us 
 They'll die 
 Wizard 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now I don't give a fuck if you 
 Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit 
 That don't mean shit to me 
 Fuck your ethnicity, nigga[Produced by Just Blaze] 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar 
 This is King Kendrick Lamar 
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw 
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it 
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us 
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor 
 And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning 
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing 
 And if they take everything, know I got 
  
 [Hook] 
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
 [Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga 
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic 
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging 
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap 
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month 
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from 
  
 [Hook] 
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman 
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga 
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga 
 Kendrick Conan nigga 
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that 
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters 
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that 
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats 
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Will swarm on me like a beehive 
 Hop in the G ride 
 From the West to the East side 
 Know that's just how Compton roll 
  
 [Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar] 
 And that's a given 
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision 
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes 
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it 
 Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business 
 I blow up every time we throw up a record 
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion 
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in 
  
 [Hook] 
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
 [Verse 5: Dr. Dre] 
 So tell that gangster throw his set high 
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high 
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly 
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I 
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye 
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive 
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye 
 Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby 
  
 [Hook] 
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
 [Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now we can all celebrate 
 We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA 
 America target our rap market, as controversy and hate 
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate 
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich 
 And the broke niggas that play 
 With them gorillas that know killers 
 That know where you stay 
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé 
 This was brought to you by Dre 
 Now every motherfucker in here say: 
 "Look who's responsible 
 For taking Compton international 
 I make 'em holla" 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie 
 Just Blaze 
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah 
 In the city of Compton 
 Ain't no city quite like mine

 Mom, I finna use the van real quick! 
 Be back, 15 minutes![Produced by Tae Beast] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Ali, you thirsty on Twitter! 
 You boo-boo, you T'd 
 You turned down, you thirsty 
 You boo-boo! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar 
 I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God 
 They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good 
 Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock 
 Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock 
 And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed 
 Like a small garage in your backyard 
 I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine 
 But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness 
 Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with 
 Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave 
 Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys 
 To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who 
 And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves 
 But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off 
  
 [Chorus] 
 'Cause every time you come around 
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God 
 Shut the fuck up... hoe 
 Every time you come around 
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me 
 Or at least inquire similar desires 
 To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P 
 I'm talking ideas, motivation 
 It's more than making, enemies, my nigga 
 Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constantly stressing 
 On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga 
 I function with you and you flaunt your pistol 
 Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo 
 Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing 
 Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend 
 That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down 
 Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid 
 Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style 
 Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off 
  
 [Chorus] 
 'Cause every time you come around 
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God 
 Shut the fuck up... scary ass 
 Every time you come around 
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star 
 I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa 
 Studying art... now paint that picture 
 Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught? 
 I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report? 
 See what I was taught, family is all I need 
 But indeed them too can run me right up a tree 
 Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative 
 Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in 
 Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways 
 Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison 
 For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms 
 Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come 
 Come to my house just to yap about your own people 
 Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins 
 I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep 
  
 [Chorus] 
 'Cause everytime y'all come around 
 Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up 
 Keep it running, Ali 
 Every time you come around 
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah 
 He say, she say 
  
 [Outro] 
 So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!" 
 Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!" 
 Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd 
 You turnt down, you thirsty 
 Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!" 
 Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!" 
 Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd 
 You turnt down, you thirsty 
 You thirsty, you boo-boo 
 You T, you turnt down 
 You boo-boo, you T'd 
 You boo-boo, you turnt down 
 You thirsty, you T'd 
 You boo-boo, you turnt down 
 You boo-boo, you T'd 
 You turnt down, you weak 
 You weak, yo’ bitch weak 
 Yeah (laughs) 
 You boo-boo, you T (laughs) 
 Keep all that 
  
 [Interlude] 
 What is HiiiPoWeR? 
 HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live 
 See it’s known today that the human race is nothing 
 No morals, no standards 
 What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations 
 No, you don’t have to have a lot of money 
 You don’t have to be rich 
 But you will be rich in mind and spirit 
 Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang 
 HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion[Produced by LoveDragon] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Study long, study wrong, nigga 
 Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker 
 Close that door! 
 My OG up in this motherfucker right now 
 My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool 
 Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like: 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I could spot you a mile away 
 I could see your insecurities written all on your face 
 So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say 
 Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang 
 With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same 
 Circus acts only attract those that entertain 
 Small talk, we know that it's all talk 
 We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
 Say you got the burner stashed to impress me 
 It's all in your head, homie 
 Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
 You sound like the feds, homie 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And the world don't respect you 
 And the culture don't accept you 
 But you think it's all love 
 And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done 
 Reputation can't protect you if you never had one 
 Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex) 
 Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex) 
 The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex 
 Let me put it back in proper context 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
 Say you got the burner stashed to impress me 
 It's all in your head, homie 
 Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
 Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
 You sound like the feds, homie 
  
 (Pause) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 What do you got to offer? 
 Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin 
 Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit 
 And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is 
 Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi 
 This is for fugazi 
 Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies 
 Bless them little hearts 
 You can never persuade me 
 You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them 
 Or you, the truth you love to bend 
 In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho 
 On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though 
 So loud, rich niggas got low money 
 And loud, broke niggas got no money 
 The irony behind it is so funny 
 And I seen it all this past year 
 Pass on some advice we feel: 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
 You ain't gotta try so hard

 [Intro] 
 So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it" 
 So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it" 
 So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it" 
 So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it" 
 So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it" 
 Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets 
 Making my conscience ask me 
 "Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?" 
 Black boy fly, black boy fly 
 Black, black boy fly, black boy fly 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo 
 I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo 
 He was the one to follow 
 He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows 
 He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow 
 Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality 
 Actually making it possible to swim 
 His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish 
 Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars 
 It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty 
 Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me 
 'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder 
 That we was just moving backwards 
 The bungalow where you find us 
 The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast 
 Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math 
 Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom 
 Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have 
 Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals 
 He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile 
 We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl 
 Eleven graders gone wrong 
 He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron 
 Now watch that black boy fly 
  
 [Hook] 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I used to be jealous of Jayceon 
 I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young 
 Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs 
 A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn 
 Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against 
 Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm 
 War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed 
 The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn 
 It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar 
 For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store 
 Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait" 
 Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes 
 Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities 
 Chillin' my conscience next to a villain 
 Compton made you believe success wasn't real 
 Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal 
 So as I peel through these lottery tickets 
 I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped 
 A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top 
 He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block 
 So watch that black boy fly 
  
 [Hook] 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted 
 Like most of the winners call it 
 Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching 
 That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan 
 Award touring the country with money from mic recording 
 The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype 
 Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40 
 And shortly, I got discouraged 
 Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting 
 Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase 
 That only one in a million will ever see better days 
 Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis 
 Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie 
 All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me 
 They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me 
 What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle? 
 When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical? 
 Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible 
 So I never believed the type of performance that I could do 
 I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got 
 I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton 
 Thank God...

 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 Hurt people that love us, love people 
 I'm inspired, so get inspired 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted? 
 Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't? 
 Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious 
 The moment that we first started? 
 Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time? 
 Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine? 
 Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up 
 Or when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response? 
 Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it? 
 Why you always buy me something when you going shopping? 
 Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me 
 Want my company rather than going club hopping? 
 Why you treating my momma like she your momma too? 
 Why you making promises that you'll forever do? 
 Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family 
 These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
  
 [Bridge: Javonte] 
 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share 
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair 
 But where do we seem to fall 
 Where do we seem to fall 
 Tender love and care, once upon a time 
 Once upon a time, we was there 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me? 
 Why you don't know what you mean to me? 
 Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed 
 Out in public curse me out and make a scenery? 
 Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me? 
 Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"? 
 Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function? 
 I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me 
 Why you slip and say her name when we having sex? 
 Why you always assuming that I still love my ex? 
 Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid 
 You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat 
 Why you never know how it feel to be lonely? 
 Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies? 
 Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go 
 Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?" (Sometimes) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
  
 [Bridge: Javonte] 
 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share 
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair 
 But where do we seem to fall 
 Where do we seem to fall 
 Tender love and care, once upon a time 
 Once upon a time, we was there 
  
 [Outro: Lamont Carey] 
 She says she loves me 
 She says she loves me 
 So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone 
 But she's beautiful 
 Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen 
 And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue 
 She says she loves me 
 And she only gives advice 
 She says she loves me 
 Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me 
 She says she needs me 
 She says she loves me 
 Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off 
 She says, she says she loves me 
 So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake 
 She says she loves me... and I don't know about love[Produced by The Roots] 
  
 [Intro: Dash Snow] 
 "I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in." 
  
 "So what keeps you alive?" 
  
 "Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing." 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Thank you 
 Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go 
 Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever 
 It still'll come up clever 
 I just need to free my thoughts, and Lord knows that I know better 
 But I ain't perfect, I ain't seen too many churches 
 Or know them testament verses 
 You should either hear me now or go deaf 
 Or end up dead, die trying and know death 
 Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath 
 Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga 
 I mean that from the bottom of my heart 
 You see my art, is all I have 
 And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt 
 Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car 
 Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from 
 We buy guns and more guns to give to the young 
 I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga 
 Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas 
 My uncle doing life inside prison he wasn't wrapped too tight 
 He told me rap about life, not rap niggas 
 That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissin' 
 My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching 
 I start evaluating, then my final intuition 
 Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up 
 We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse 
 Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre 
 And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph 
 Wrap saran our defiance, ban our alliance 
 Put burners in the hands, of the black man 
 One hood with 20 four-four's like a cloned Kobe Bryant 
 You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am 
 You probably even listen to Faith, and think I know Zion 
 But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth 
 Because it seem like it's always clashing with science 
 I got a big fear of flying 
 My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice,  I ain't lying 
 I swear to God half of ya'll just don't know Kendrick 
 The school of hardknocks, we was the first ones in attendance 
 You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness 
 You just mind your business 
 You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis 
 It's kind of scary ain't it? 
 You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous 
 Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless 
 'Cause your pops wasn't anxious 
 To see you and you hate it 
 So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation 
 So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him 
 Facing 25 to life with a murder charge 
 Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God 
 I pray these bars get farther than Compton 
 And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise 
 I promise to keep it honest 
 Secret society all we ask is trust 
 And all we lack is communication like service sucks 
 The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come 
 And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?" 
 Gotta keep it pushing 
 Can't let the government tell me how my future looking 
 I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins' 
 If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin' 
 Never will I surrender 
 I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta 
 In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter 
 How splendid, I guess my project had did it 
 Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different 
 They said seven tracks, I said fifteen 
 Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin' 
 But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules 
 That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions 
 Uppity bitches, handling business 
 Killing our dreams, stealing our vision 
 Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home 
 In L.A everybody think they fucking on 
 Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit 
 Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone 
 I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick 
 You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended 
 Ain’t doing this for my health I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes 
 Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions 
 Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living 
 Look the mastermind, took the master's mind 
 Just the perfect time, just to master mine 
 Just to match the grind with precision 
 Look the mastermind, took - (cough) 
  
 [Outro: Alori Joh] 
 We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated[Intro] 
 Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower 
 Me and my niggas (Live forever) 
 3 eyes to my alumni 
 Feel this 
 I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight) 
 Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight) 
 My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga? 
 (My niggas on point, game tight) 
 There we go yeah, turn me up 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me 
 Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep 
 Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got 
 But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop 
 So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block 
 My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do) 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit 
 Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb 
 C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere 
 I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière 
 Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs 
 Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something 
 They pussies, I smell something 
 You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy 
 I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga 
 Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream 
 Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do) 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit 
 Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew 
 And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do) 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit 
 Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop 
 Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop 
 Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers 
 Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer 
 I come from Compton, we ain't have it all 
 Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall 
 And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking 
 Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked 
 Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs 
 I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne 
 If not J. Cole, your shit is trash 
 But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh 
 This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment 
 I guess this is speculation making a classic came with 
 If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct 
 Real people want real music, the jig is up 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole] 
 Your worst fear is confirmed 
 We love that you crashed and burned 
 The real is back 
 K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap 
 King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick 
 Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling 
 Stand for something or die in the morning 
 The city hail King Kendrick Lamar 
 The world hail King Kendrick Lamar 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do) 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit 
 Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew 
 And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do) 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit 
 Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This is my life and I look at it like its my last 
 And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past 
 And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast 
 And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke 
 So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab 
 Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them 
 Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut 
 Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what 
 See now we dump'n out the roof[Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Smoke good, eat good, live good 
 Smoke good, eat good, live good

 Smoke good, eat good, live good 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary 
 Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me 
 Since my uncles was institutionalized 
 My intuition had said I was suited for family ties 
 My momma is stressin', my daddy tired 
 I need me a weapon, these niggas ride 
 Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me 
 How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God? 
 Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts 
 My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink 
 You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga 
 The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya 
 I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun 
 And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie 
 Stand for something or fall for anything 
 And you working with two left feet at the skating rink 
 But anyway, this for my niggas 
 Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures 
 I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow 
 That you hear the music I wrote 
 Hope it get you off Death Row 
 You came home to a pocket full of stones 
 A Metro PC phone, then you went back in 
 So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view 
 I'ma get it right, just so you... 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

 And I do this for the city 
 Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me 
 Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me 
 If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga 
 The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya 
 I like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya 
 Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya 
 I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial 
 Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me 
 My killings are not remorseful 
 The city got my back and for that I give them my torso 
 You think about it; and don't call me lyrical 
 'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual 
 I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve 
 My simplest shit be more pivotal 
 I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals 
 Worrisome individuals that live life critical 
 So won't you bear witness while I bare feet 
 So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me 
 But anyway, this for my pops 
 On his lunch break eating in that parking lot 
 On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves 
 But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved 
 Somebody said my name on the radio 
 He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute 
 So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it 
 He'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...

 [Outro: GLC] 
 Church is definitely on the move 
 And now we done took it up to the cathedral 
 'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 We out here rotating under the five P's 
 Proper preparation prevents poor performance 
 You know what I'm talking 'bout? Doing my thing 
 'Cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping 
 From the Windy City streets all the way out here 
 To the streets of Compton, know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 Church is definitely on the move 
 And we gonna continue to hustle and grow and develop by far 
 As I rotate with my true player partner 
 By the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man 
 That's the only way your pockets gonna expand 
 I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 Apply yourself to supply your wealth 
 Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yo'self 
 Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else 
 Cathedral, church, "ism"[Produced by Willie B] 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Lord forgive me... kill him where he stand and stand over him 
 Shake his hand then jump back in that minivan 
 Double back to his block and blam I ain't backing down for nothing 
 I'mma back 'em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand 
 Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man 
 Police radio signals saying that a 187 land 
 On your corner, coroners comfort your momma 
 "Momma he's dead" the next morning, I toasted up with my homies 
 We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh 
 You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton 
 Ask me what I have accomplished, I don't know I don't have conscience 
 I just load up and start dumping on enemies; I'm head hunting 
 No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something 
 Protect ya neck cause they coming for sets, respect, split your onion 
 Then chop your deck your head tumbling like gymnastics 
 (Cause ignorance is bliss) 
  
 [Chorus: Schoolboy Q] 
 Now everybody put your hands up high 
 If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far 
 And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I diss ya'll 
 We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off 
 Until the day I pistol whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off, then peel off 
 In a hooptie, come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me 
 And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me 
 Indubitably I'm too street, indubitably I'mma do me 
 Better than your bitch would 
 But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks and I'm good 
 I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm 
 Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent 
 No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish 
 Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet 
 Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic 
 Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic 
 Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged 
 Die young, corpse identified by your parents 
 Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint 
 But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff 
 Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments 
 The critics are calling me conscious 
 But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton 
 So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common? 
 Proves that ignorance is bliss 
  
 [Chorus: Schoolboy Q] 
 Now everybody put your hands up high 
 If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far 
 And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off 
 This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball 
 And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard 
 I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call 
 Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off 
 I show up, to show out and show off, you a hundred percent behind me 
 And if you are, then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene 
 I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me 
 Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me 
 Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches 
 We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her 
 Cause ignorance is bliss 
 And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats, I bleed out the speaker 
 As the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak[Hook: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor 
 Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal 
 Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
 Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor 
 Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal 
 Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow 
 And this I know 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum 
 Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk 
 Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk 
 How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want 
 See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety 
 Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society 
 Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me 
 So I justify his name on obituary 
 Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart? 
 Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God 
 Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got 
 Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked 
 Watch you when you walk inside your house 
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch 
 I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out 
 Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms 
 Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise] 
 Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor 
 Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal 
 Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
 And that means the world to me 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle 
 Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle 
 These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble 
 'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait 
 That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin' 
 Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension 
 Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance 
 It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night 
 I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall 
 Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws 
 I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful 
 I pray my experience helps you 
 As for me I'm tryna sort it out 
 Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul 
 But who knows? 
 I just need a little space to breathe 
 I know perception is key, so I am king 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock] 
 The other side has never mortified my mortal mind 
 The borderline between insanity is father time 
 I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind 
 I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died 
 Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise 
 A tape worm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite 
 A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify 
 But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice 
 I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith 
 Genocism and capitalism just made me hate 
 Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date 
 Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake 
 I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place 
 Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes 
 Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates? 
 Or this is just a mirage or a facade 
 Wait[Produced by Jack Splash] 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We on? 
 Aight 
 1,2,3, go! 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Waking up in a dream 
 Sleepwalking on another big stage 
 You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream 
 Your name in unison, I'm so far away 
 From the place I used to be, struggling usually 
 Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me 
 I can feel the energy in the air 
 It feel like I'm supposed to be here 
  
 [Bridge: Mary J. Blige] 
 Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love 
 Fans, the stars, everyone 
 Sayin how they can't wait for the LP 
 And I'm gonna blow 
 They believe in me 
 Feel so good in what you do 
 Helps somebody else get through 
 That's why I do the best I can 
 Because I know how blessed I am 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I shine so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 A fool if I take it all for granted 
 A smart man if I keep my feet planted 
 To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it 
 You speakin' outlandish 
 I'mma show you how to make it all work 
 Another planet, it's a short term goal for me 
 A record sold for me 
 It's just more of me in your ear 
 For you to hear Kendrick persevere 
 Defenses I feel relentless 
 Ambition with a clear vision 
 Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons 
 I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance 
 Came across me, how much it'a cost me 
 To get you out my business 
 I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit 
 I'm past that, now pass that 
 Award, not one but four 
 Times two plus yours 
  
 [Bridge: Mary J. Blige] 
 I see myself performing there, (K.dot) 
 Sold out shows where the room is packed 
 Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards 
 See myself on big billboards 
 Traveling around the world with endorsement deals 
 Can't imagine how it feels 
 That's why I'm smiling everyday 
 Because my dream ain't far away 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I shine so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed 
 Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath 
 Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly 
 You see me when at my best, my worst 
 This verse dedicated to the days that I slept 
 With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed 
 I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown 
 I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile? 
 And I vow on the tape that I'll never break 
 You can break bread with me now 
 We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal 
 Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue 
 And walked that mile 
 In the darkness I often sit back 
 And get lost in the rap that I wrote 
 When you told me that it spoke to your soul 
 I was talking to you 
 I was walking it through every ghetto 
 Tell success hello 
 We here 
  
 [Bridge: Mary J. Blige] 
 And I'm so happy I cry 
 Cause I can't believe 
 All the things I ever wanted 
 Are finally happening for me 
 And it's so surreal 
 That I almost feel 
 That any minute I can wake up 
 From this fantasy 
 When you pray so hard 
 And you've come so far 
 And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar 
 And I'm gonna do it 
 Watch me! 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I shine so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I shine so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better[Produced by Rahki]​​

 This is a world premiere! 
 This is a world premiere! 
  
 [Intro] 
 I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 Satan wanna put me in a bow tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
 But an enemigo never drown me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And I love myself 
 (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
 I love myself 
 (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind) 
 I love myself 
 (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
 I love myself 
 (One day at a time, sun gonna shine) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!) 
 What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?) 
 Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving) 
 Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)? 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
 How many times my potential was anonymous? 
 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I love myself 
 (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
 I love myself 
 (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind) 
 I love myself 
 (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
 I love myself 
 (One day at a time, sun gonna shine) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street 
 And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police 
 And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene yup 
 These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation 
 I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis 
 Dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast 
 The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now 
 The strong in me, I still smile 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I love myself 
 (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
 I love myself 
 (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind) 
 I love myself 
 (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
 I love myself 
 (One day at a time, sun gonna shine) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet) 
 Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep) 
 Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself) 
 My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself) 
  
 [Hook] 
 The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs

 But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind

 One day at a time, sun gonna shine

 [Verse 3] 
 I went to war last night 
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
 I'ma do it till I get it right 
 I went to war last night 
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
 Duckin' every other blessin'  I can never see the message 
 I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave 
 From a negative and letting them annihilate me 
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street 
 Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free 
 Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read 
 And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen 
 Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!" 
  
 [Outro] 
 I lost my head 
 I must've misread what the good book said 
 Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
 Give myself again 'til the well runs dry (i)

 [Chorus: Colin Munroe] 
 I love the way you put it on your eyes 
 The roses on your face light up the sky 
 Those lips are colorful all of the time 
 And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind 
 No make-up today, no make-up today 
 No make-up today, no make-up to... 
 And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I know she 'bout to ask me how she look 
 I tell her beautiful, and how long it took 
 For you to put it on, it was early in the morn' 
 She resembled a model out of a Mac book 
 Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens 
 I stand behind her and try to figure her vision 
 Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone 
 Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown 
 Damn girl, why so much? 
 You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up 
 Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing 
 From heaven, is where you got it from 
 I love your smile, you can do it without style 
 From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows 
 It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur 
 I don't see it, all I see is a blur 
  
 [Chorus: Colin Munroe] 
 I love the way you put it on your eyes 
 The roses on your face light up the sky 
 Those lips are colorful all of the time 
 And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind 
 No make-up today, no make-up today 
 No make-up today, no make-up to...

 Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone 
 My complexion in a direction I've outgrown 
 I feel like it's not enough 
 I can never put on too much make-up 
 Yeah, I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing 
 From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to 
 Smile at least once in a while 
 I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows 
 It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see 
 Is that I had a black ey- To be continued... 11

 Two tears in the bucket, I cry with you 
 But I could never lie with you 
 I could never afford not to afford 
 I could never put my plans to the side with you 
 I could never see a red light 
 Like a deer with a headlight 
 I freeze up when I re-up 
 See, I barely have patience, and you're relating 
 Only the moment to complete us 
 Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it 
 See a nine to five was so jive turkey 
 But when Thanksgiving came, that check didn’t hurt me 
 You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment 
 We both criminals with bad intentions 
 They say time heals all 
 But if I can shortcut my success, Corvettes by tomorrow 
  
 [Hook] 
 Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My home girl got a credit card scam 
 She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn 
 Intuition got a Black woman wishin' 
 She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan 
 I know you, woman, I console you, woman 
 You feel like the universe owes you, woman 
 Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it 
 Women don't prosper, chasin' education 
 But you're talented, and can't handle it 
 And your homegirls can't be your manager 
 365 times four, plus more 
 Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina? 
 But  ain't no money like fast money 
 Even today, I'm considered a crash dummy 
 A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward 
 My accolades better than all them? 
  
 [Hook] 
 But why so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I love God, I love speed 
 I love drank, I love mead 
 I love oceans in the deep 
 I love women, I love me 
 I love God 
 But I’m scared of godspeed 
 Sometimes 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I wrote this song looking at a broke home, maybe 
 You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies 
 Somebody say "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy" 
 And I said “Why?” 
 Then he looked me in the eye, and said "Homie, you're messed up 
 You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles 
 Never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical 
 You settle for everything, complain about everything 
 You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine 
 Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut 
 I'm living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent 
 I paid my way through, praying to Allah 
 You played your way through, dinner with wi-fi 
 Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers 
 Same thing goes for the ones you came with 
 We all came on the boat looking for hope 
 And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope 
 These days ain’t no compromise 
 Your pain ain’t mines half the time 
 A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me 
 See, I made my moves, with shackled feet" 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Cape Town, Cape Town 
 Cape Town, Cape Town 
 Cape Town 
 Cape Town, Cape Town 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Cornrow Kenny 
 All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr 
 Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr 
 Cornrow Kenny 
 So many plays on me I finesse 
 Palisade views with some sex 
 I lost a lot of love for missionary 
 This the first time I react 
 Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil 
 A father figure play with him, you get killed 
 Play with me and he will kill you himself 
 TDE the mafia of the west 
 Move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that 
 Act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that 
 I did a lot of dumb things in my past 
 Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse 
 Dave just bought a new 911 
 Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash 
 Q just bought a brand new McLaren 
 Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects 
 Moosa got his son dripping in gold 
 Me? I'm about to let my hair down on hoes 
 Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes 
 Top billing, that’s a million a show 
 Might blow the no whammy on Soul 
 Might tell Obama be more like Punch 
 Sounwave got a Grammy this year 
 Mack wop, bet he do what he want 
 Level two, level two, no, I’m not done 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 I could put a rapper on life support 
 Guarantee something that none of you want 
 Ten homies down and they all serving life 
 What is like twenty-five hundred a month? 
 What if I empty my bank out and stunt? 
 What if I empty my bank out and stunt? 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got,  you ain’t got 
 Tell me that, tell me that, that I'm the one 
 You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got 
 You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one 
 Yes, I’m the one[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh] 
 What's your life about? Enlighten me 
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet? 
 S'Fire in the street, fire in my Swisher 
 Fire in between the two legs of your little sister 
 Just get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture 
 I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen cops circle the block 
 I puff squares, but I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch 
 On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment 
 Can you hear these screams? 
 (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two 
 Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey 
 A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary 
 Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell 
 Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in 
 The president is black, but you can't vote for skin 
 You vote for the better man 
 Come to our show, you can see the diversity 
 Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally 
 We might not change the world 
 But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin' 
 Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know? 
 We knew we'd be here, like back in 04' 
 Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator 
 In a system meant to disintegrate us 
 And all we do is assist them 
 We're not victors, we're victims 
 The bigger picture isn't developed yet 
 Like what if Keisha was celibate? 
 Or what if Tammy came across a real man 
 Who didn't play games like children? 
 My nigga cheated on his girlfriend 
 With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end 
 And everybody tripping off 2012 
 And the extraterrestrial presence as well 
 (Odd Future's aight) But our future is not 
 That Martial law shit dropped, we gon' all get got 
 So keep that question mark on your face 
 Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste 
 Hide your feelings from the public 
 Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes 
 And to thank God you're alive 
 HiiiPower 
 And on another note 
 We focused like the Hubble Telescope 
 Soul! 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh] 
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam 
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam 
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam 
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam 
 Life is a traffic jam 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul] 
 I wrote this because I was ordered to 
 People say I speak for generation Y 
 Why lie, I do, Section 80 
 Your son will play me if the radio won't 
 Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick 
 For instance 
 What's your life about? Enlighten me 
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet? 
 Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree 
 And do exactly what you see on TV 
 True story, hmm 
 Can you repeat that for me, Soul? 
 What's your life about? Enlighten me 
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet? 
 Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn? 
 The time is now my child, come on 
 See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar 
 Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes 
 God and history all in the same sentence 
 You know what all the things have in common? 
 Only half of the truth, if you tell it 
 See I spent twenty-three years on the earth searching for answers 
 'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own 
 I'm not on the outside looking in 
 I'm not on the inside looking out 
 I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around 
 You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man? 
 That's an analogy for the way the world make me react 
 My innocence been dead 
 So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes 
 God and history all in the same sentence 
 Just know I meant it, and you felt it 
 'Cause you too are searching for answers 
 I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper 
 I am a human mothafuckin' being over dope ass instrumentation 
 Kendrick Lamar! 
 Now fuck 'em up Terrace! 
 (Soul!) 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I watch this fire that we’re gathered around 
 And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you 
 Section.80 
 Section.80 babies 
 A generation of bliss and disobedience 
 Know they can't control us 
 Know they can't control you 
 Know they can't control us 
 But we can control each other 
 We build our own world 
 If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself 
 You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us 
 Our family 
 Heart, honor and respect 
 This is you, this is me 
 And we are HiiiPower

 (Why I go easy?) 
 (Know why I go easy) 
 Wait 
  
 [Chorus] 
 King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland 
 King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again 
 King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin' 
 King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin' 
 King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed 
 King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect 
 King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it 
 King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction 
 King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated 
 King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken 
 King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse 
 King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice 
 King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion 
  
 [Verse] 
 Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision 
 I embrace them with collision, kings did it 
 King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king! 
 I dropped a million tears 
 I know several responsibilities put me here 
 I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned 
 The lens that I'm lookin' through 
 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free 
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas 
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me 
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace 
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef 
 What do you stand for? 
 Are you a activist? What are your city plans for? 
 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way? 
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say 
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open? 
 Because the king don't cry, king don't die 
 King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall 
 Kingdom come, when I come, you know why 
 KING! KING! KING! KING! KING! 
 I am T'Challa[Intro: Bilal] 
 Come here, girl 
 Oh, you want me to touch you right there? 
 Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair 
 Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now 
 Like that? I got you baby 
 All on you baby 
 Push it back on daddy 
 Push it back on daddy baby 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is... 
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory 
 Life no longer infinity this was the final calling 
 No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking 
 We all nervous and crying, moving in caution 
 In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this 
 The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling 
 The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman 
 With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction 
 The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable 
 Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid 
 Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys 
 Valleys and high places turn into dust 
 Famous screaming in agony 
 Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky 
 Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive" 
 Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness 
 Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes 
 Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out 
 Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out 
 Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted 
 Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it 
 (It's happening) no more running from world wars 
 (It's happening) no more discriminating the poor 
 (It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas 
 Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure 
 I swore I seen it vividly 
 A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony 
 Thunder like number four, then I heard 
 "What have you did for me" 
 I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume 
 That dated back to June 17th, 1987 
 My paperwork was like a receipt 
 I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment 
 But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors 
 Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever 
 Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home 
 Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell 
 Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel 
 I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you 
 Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you 
 Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you 
 I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you 
 Who love you like I love you? 
 Crucifix, tell me you can fix 
 Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary 
 Never would you lie to me 
 Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered 
 Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet 
 All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse 
 I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church 
  
 [Outro] 
 Young nigga act an ass 
 Young nigga act a fool 
 Young nigga get yo' cash 
 Young nigga do what it do 
 Young nigga go, young nigga go 
 Young nigga go, young nigga go 
 Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch 
 Just take it all back before the light switch[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Check, check, check, check, check 
 It go... 
  
 [Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 To the meaning of life, what's my purpose? 
 Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be 
 How far is heaven? Let's see 
 Is it in the clouds like they said it would be? 
 I wonder when I die will he give me receipts? 
 I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me? 
 Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner 
 I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner 
 I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer 
 What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just 
  
 [Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It go one (one), two (two), three (three) 
 Two in the front, one in the back seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat) 
 Looking for a victim of an AK-47 100-round each, each, each 
 But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature? 
 I don't know, I look for the answers later 
 "Make a right, there they go!" 
 Sometimes you gotta 
  
 [Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer 
 My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons 
 I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens 
 A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11 
 That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right 
 But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight 
 Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice? 
 Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar 
 When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray 
 I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away 
 Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it 
 I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence 
 I'm running, they say I'm wilding, a young'n with lack of guidance 
 That's hundreds of us with problems 
 Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence 
 Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist 
 That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life 
 But regardless I'ma 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know 
 When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
  
 [Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 Yeah, life can please you, but death can tease you 
 On the day Niko had that seizure 
 I lost one of my biggest believers, aww! 
 Close deaths make you think about your life 
 Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different? 
 I'd tell her I loved her more, do more 
 But tease her 'bout crying on that picture 
 Now when I'm done recording 
 Swear, I let the beat bang in her name 
 Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They at it again" 
 Make them clouds turn to speakers 
 Don't take too much smoke from the reefer 
 Love being in the room with her peoples 
 Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries 
 Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me 
 Lord, what kind of life is this? 
 "Momma, I just wanna sing" 
 Momma said, "According to get everything... 
 You gotta risk everything" 
 So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians 
 Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians 
 Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians 
 Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians[Intro: The Sylvers & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Pillars of joy can be found 
 Through the thought of you 
 I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love 
 Canei Finch on the beat 
 Turn the headphones up, Ali 
 Here we go 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I woke up this morning with my dick on hard 
 Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all 
 Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl 
 Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl 
 I put my life in these sentences 
 Fucking right, it's either that or life sentences 
 I'm relatives with Benjamin 
 I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent 
 Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton 
 Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that 
 Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that 
 They say he got smoke, like where the weed at? 
 And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that 
 Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95 
 Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised 
 Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine 
 Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times 
 So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure 
 Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink 
 Bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink 
 And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me 
  
 [Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm so damn turnt 
 Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me 
 And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos 
 Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though 
 When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke 
 Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but 
 Westside, right on time, only thing fosho 
 Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door 
  
 [Verse 2: Young Jeezy] 
 I woke up this morning like fuck the world 
 Been hustling since I was twelve, man, I've been through hell 
 Now these motherfuckers is trying to tell me I don't care 
 Trying to tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there 
 Turnt, posted up on the block, waiting for mail 
 From my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail 
 Could've cost your boy everything, man, it wasn't cheap 
 Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak 
 Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check, mane 
 'Cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain 
 Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo 
 Young, you like your bitches with ass? I like you, hoe! 
 First, them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto 
 Plus, I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno 
 Brown bag full of cash, baby, MCM 
 When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm so turnt 
 Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me 
 And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos 
 Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though 
 When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke 
 Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but 
 Westside, right on time, only thing fosho 
 Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All praise go to the most high 
 All fades turn into a drive-by 
 Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed 
 Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you 
 Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K 
 Minus six racks, minus one on top of that? 
 Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape 
 Daytonas bending every corner while they say 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm so turnt 
 Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me 
 And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos 
 Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though 
 When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke 
 Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but 
 Westside, right on time, only thing fosho 
 Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds 
 And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in 
 Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo 
 Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket 
 I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint 
 That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes 
 A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette 
 Twenty years later: hi hater, I'm the fucking best 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm so turnt 
 Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me 
 And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos

 [Chorus: Jhene Aiko] 
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down 
 Where are you going, we should be growing now 
 (Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga) 
 Where are we going, we should be slowing down 
 Where are you going, we should be growing now 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home 
 Is just a bed to me 
 We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep 
 Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it 
 And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me 
 As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness 
 Look each other in the face and barely blink 
 I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink 
 So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync 
  
 [Chorus: Jhene Aiko] 
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down 
 Where are you going, we should be growing now 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition 
 Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track 
 Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping 
 Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions 
 Club night, guys and dolls 
 Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball 
 I’m calling out for help, my engineer called 
 Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah 
  
 [Chorus: Jhene Aiko] 
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down 
 Where are you going, we should be growing now 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 That’s what he said to me 
 But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go 
 Seven billion people on planet Earth today 
 Is there something that I don’t know 
 I know to follow Him rather following people 
 Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil 
 Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral 
 Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you 
  
 [Chorus: Jhene Aiko] 
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down 
 Where are you going, we should be growing now 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So in conclusion 
 We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise 
 Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size 
 So to what is important in my life, I apologize 
 I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified 
 We all get distracted, the question is 
 Would you bounce back or bounce backwards? 
 Would you not know how to act or take action? 
 It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight 
  
 [Outro: Jhene Aiko] 
 Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry 
 Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry 
 And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would 
 Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer...[Produced by THC] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Don't judge me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key 
 Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key 
 She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think 
 Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street 
 She be like: 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga 
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Until one day he wasn't acting right 
 In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right 
 When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone 
 Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial 
 So when she got home, it was going down, she go: 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit 
 Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks 
 With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist 
 In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this 
 She be like: 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga 
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other... 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night 
 She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum 
 And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye 
 Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side 
 Homeboy was smiling, she gon': 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other... 
  
 [Verse 5] 
 And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up 
 Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that 
 It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound? 
 They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now 
 Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand 
 To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim 
 So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright 
 The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they: 
  
 [Hook 3] 
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas 
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas 
 Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas...

 Tammy's song[Hook] 
 Why so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Two tears in the bucket I cry with you 
 But I could never lie with you 
 I could never afford not to afford 
 I could never put my plans to the side with you 
 I could never see a red light 
 Like a deer with a headlight 
 I freeze up when I re-up 
 See I barely have patience 
 And you're relating 
 Only the moment to complete us 
 Why you hate to work for it? 
 The reason I never went to work for it 
 See a nine to five was so jive turkey 
 But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me 
 You plead the fifth 
 I read the Fifth Amendment 
 We both criminals with bad intentions 
 They say time heals all 
 But if I can shortcut 
 My success, Corvettes by tomorrow 
 Wait a minute! 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now, why you so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My home girl got a credit card scam 
 She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn 
 Intuition got a broke bitch wishin' 
 She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan 
 I know you, woman, I console you, woman 
 You feel like the universe owes you, woman 
 Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it 
 Bitches don't prosper chasing education 
 But you're talented, and can't handle it 
 And your homegirls can't be your manager 
 365 times four, plus more 
 If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina? 
 But shit, ain't no money like fast money 
 Even today I'm considered a crash dummy 
 A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward? 
 My accolades better than all them 
  
 [Hook] 
 Why you so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby 
 You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies 
 Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy" 
 And I said “why?” 
 Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up" 
 You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles 
 You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical 
 You settle for everything, complain about everything 
 You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine 
 Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch 
 I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent 
 I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah 
 You played your way through, by living in sci-fi 
 Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers 
 Same thing goes for the ones you came with 
 When y'all came on the boat looking for hope 
 And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope 
 These days ain’t no compromise 
 And your pain ain’t mines half the time 
 A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me 
 Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet 
 Cape Town 
  
 [Interlude] 
 In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out 
 You wait on them, him and her 
 But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong 
 You selfish motherfucker 
  
 [Hook] 
 Why so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

 [Verse 1] 
 Everybody know I spit that other shit 
 Shit that make you duck for cover shit 
 Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit 
 Especially when Drop drop the beat 
 I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs 
 Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream 
 They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem 
 That's a jab, you should bob and weave 
 Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve 
 I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd 
 Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb 
 You telling me the kush make you think on level four? 
 I'm on five, you saying that I can level more? 
 In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress 
 Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects 
 I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time 
 Creation of man, and Columbine 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote 
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro 
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo 
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers 
 Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa 
 Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour 
 They're new booties, they probably need baby powder 
 My skill shower over your city for 40 days 
 40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves 
 Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays 
 My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised 
 Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout 
 You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about 
 Copy my session on a disc when the session ends 
 So my momma can have it and play it for her friends 
 Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win 
 Somehow, someday, and I don't care when" 
 I might hit the gin once a month 
 I'll let you inhale, like an atheist 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote 
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro 
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo 
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'll take you back to the 9th grade 
 When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days 
 That's my nigga, he a street nigga 
 Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga 
 But anyway I think it was some purple 
 Told me "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you" 
 I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade 
 Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes 
 That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored 
 The same time I start writing like a fucking monster 
 I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders 
 Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T 
 Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks 
 Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh 
 Am I a square cause I don't puff a square? 
 Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote 
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro 
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo 
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

 These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see 
 A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me 
  
 [Bridge 1: Kendrick Lamar &  CeeLo Green] 
 Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl 
 I can explain 
 I know it's foreign to you 
 I know it's hard to believe 
 God give me the favor 
 Let me explain 
 More than a compliment 
 And I could use some assistance, let me show you how 
 I can explain 
 Oh shando! I spin around two times 
 I'll be there with the answer 
 Let me explain 
  
 [Verse 1: CeeLo Green] 
 I'm bizarre, avant-garde 
 Both sides of me are evenly odd 
 It's attractive, you're intrigued 
 Am I mortal man or make believe? 
 Anything you want 
 I can explain 
 I can explain it 
 Any misunderstandings, baby 
 Let me explain 
 I can explain it 
 Why don't you sit and talk to me? 
 I can explain 
 Let me explain it, ah yeah 
 Let me explain 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented 
 Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed 
 I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways 
 Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more 
 You know the male species can be redundant 
 I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her 
 Between sheets, covers and pillows 
 I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero 
 I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero 
 Cause you believe in me 
 No you're not easily impressed 
 But I possess qualities that you need to see 
 Look at my flaws, look at my flaws 
 Look at my imperfections in awe 
 Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause 
 And yours equally valued 
 You stick out like an alien compared to those around you 
 And that's alright because I like it 
 You and me are the same 
 Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change 
 Because I know for sure who you are 
  
 [Bridge 2: Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green] 
 I can explain 
 Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you 
 Hand washing your clothes on Sunday 
 Let me explain 
 Walking your brother to school, three miles away 
 To feed his body and soul 
 I can explain 
 Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels 
 Let me explain 
 I wanna know what you think 
 I wanna pick your brain when I see you 
 But don't you ever 
 Let me explain 
 Oh shando! I spin around two times 
 A blessing in disguise 
 I can explain 
 I know for sure who you are 
 You're the goddess of the odd 
 I am yours 
 I can explain 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I am yours 
 I am yours 
 I am yours 
 I am yours

 Look at all the bullshit I been through 
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth? 
 Look at all the bullshit I been through 
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Momma take this mothafuckin' block off 
 Tryna reach you every day, collect calls 
 Never get through, and I go through withdrawals 
 Say who told you that I wanted this door 
 To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or 
 Ask you if you give me your rent for 
 A attorney, I can pay you back more 
 Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours 
 Commissary running low, I need help 
 Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself 
 K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed 
 If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel 
 Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit 
 And I heard she fucking on some other nigga 
 And my niggas left me in the dark, blind 
 Mama just get back at me this last time 
  
 [Hook] 
 Men lie, wo—women lie 
 Men lie, wo—women 
 Men lie, wo—women lie

 [Verse 2] 
 Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off 
 That's on the date the day I take the block off 
 Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars 
 Please believe me, this ain't easy by far 
 You forgot you're talking to your only son 
 'Member when you put me in that relay run 
 I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best 
 You had taught me that the very day I won 
 All I need is you to give me same support 
 Investigation saying that the same report 
 From a witness just might testify in court 
 DA say I take a deal, or take a loss 
 I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers 
 God's will, say a prayer for me mama 
 If you can't, then open up the phone lines 
 Mama just get back at me this last time 
  
 [Hook] 
 Men lie, wo—women lie 
 Men lie, wo—women 
 Men lie, wo—women lie

 Look at all the bullshit I been through

 [Verse 3] 
 Dante, if I stress to take the block off 
 That's the day the state had take them locks off 
 I could only help but do so much 
 Bettering yourself, your own crutch 
 Look at your reflection, tell me who you see 
 Who is your protection? G-O-D 
 No, it's not neglect-ion, I have just accepted 
 Your fate and what its gon' be 
 'Member all the nights that I cried 
 Thinkin' that my only son just died 
 Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door 
 It's you they looking for, raid outside 
 Rather see you locked up than dead 
 Only you would say that I'm selfish 
 So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand 
 Son, let me say this 
  
 [Hook] 
 Men lie, wo—women lie

 One two, one two, one two

 Turn the headphones up Ali 
 One two 
 You mix with Dre, right? 
 Turn the headphones up 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated 
 That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated 
 Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it 
 But I could never rewrite history in a coffin 
 So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?" 
 This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah 
 Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered 
 A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere 
 The presence of being real" 
 As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles 
 Thinking, "How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?" 
 My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished 
 Or turning back to that same accomplice 
 My past life was a child with no act right 
 Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site 
 Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent 
 Assuring that some blossom early and some truant 
 Thank God for the album I idolized 
 It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride 
 Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage 
 And thought we was Jay and Dame 
 That's the lane that we tried to drive 
 Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away 
 I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse 
 My nigga got hit 25 times with a K 
 Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse 
 Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach 
 Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote 
 His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast 
 Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store 
 Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out 
 Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought 
 Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch 
 We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount 
 Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other 
 The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort 
 But I ain't need it 
 I never screamed out "the New West," I didn't believe it 
 They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements 
 I need to separate myself to stand out 
 I need a better way to take your fans now 
 I need to kill you motherfuckers dead 
 Three hollow tips aimed at your head 
 I'll be damned if the chopper jam now 
 And we never asked for no hand out 
 In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how 
 We could never resolve in the hall of fame 
 And I went to the trial with a Bible and a rifle 
 I play the game as I blam blow 
 Hollaback at me, nigga 
 And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga? 
 'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated 
 Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David 
 And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix 
 'Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious 
 I need to separate myself to stand out 
 I need a better way to take your fans now 
 I need to kill you motherfuckers dead 
 Three hollow tips aimed at your head 
  
 [Verse 2: Ab-Soul] 
 I'll be damned if the chopper jam now 
 And we never asked for no hand out 
 I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now 
 In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out 
 Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now 
 Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport 
 The homies was still poor, with work in a Jansport 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre? 
 Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play 
 And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop 
 Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit 
 Rapped with my forefathers, even record with Gaga too 
 Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay Rock] 
 Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes 
 Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true 
 Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose 
 I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth 
 Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof 
 I came, I saw, I conquered 
 No shame, I blame all of this on Compton 
 Thinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up 
 Cold game, full circle, they set up her 
 I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs 
 The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong 
 The story was short film, the glory of him and them 
 The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed 
 The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation 
 The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it 
 The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question 
 Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd? 
 Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?[Verse: SZA & Kendrick Lamar] 
 They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth 
 (Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...) 
 And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you 
 (What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...) 
 They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due 
 (Talk about the charge you got...) 
 And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth 
 (Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool) 
  
 [Segno: SZA & Kendrick Lamar] 
 (But) head is the answer, head is the future 
 Don't second guess yourself 
 (Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...) 
 Come on give me some help, hey 
 Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl 
  
 [Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA] 
 Don't second guess yourself 
 Come on, give me some help 
 And I just wanna 
 And I just wanna 
 Straight up 
 Eyes with my head 
 And I can't use some help 
 Straight up

 Back then we was wearing LA Gears with the rhinestones 
 Nowadays I’m coming headfirst like a rhino 
 I rhyme like I invented it my wordplay is unlimited

 Uh 
 Every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink 
 Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink 
 Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair 
 Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here 
 And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes

 This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head 
 Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich 
 Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave 
 I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways 
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me 
 And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see 
 I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper 
 A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy! 
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me 
 And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see 
 This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular 
 I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come 
 You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though? 
 We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks? 
 Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em 
 Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming 
 I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me 
 I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink 
 Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink 
 Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair 
 Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here 
 And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes 
 Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch 
 Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas 
 I’m three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Man, the game chose me, what am I to do? 
 The only thing I did wrong was make it possible 
 I diddy bop and make them titties pop 
 Out there on my bumper like a city cop 
 Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it 
 Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it 
 Aye, pussy crazy, pussy crazy 
 You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy 
 Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie 
 But I know I can tell you about your girl homie 
 Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me 
 I know they pay me too much of attention 
 Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned 
 I need me an engine that go real fast 
 Call it hall of fame once it haul ass 
 Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc 
 Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop 
 Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy 
 But I make that pussy pay me 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink 
 Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink 
 Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair 
 Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here 
  
 And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes 
 Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch 
 Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas 
 I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that… 
  
 [Verse 3: Schoolboy Q] 
 I remember tripping, walking through the set 
 Like my Glock don’t think 
 Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink 
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me 
 And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see 
 I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane 
 You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain 
 We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man 
 You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes 
 Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong 
 We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong 
 You know I’m gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough? 
 My paper long, yep, you left alone, you gets no fucks 
 Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round 
 Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round 
 Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down 
 Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth 
 You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done 
 I can be her number two and you can be her number one 
 Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy, you fuck niggas 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink 
 Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink 
 Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair 
 Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here 
 And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes 
 Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch 
 Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas 
 I’m three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk 
 I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want 
 But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance 
 To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man 
 I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service 
 Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?" 
 He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me 
 Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday 
 I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen 
 I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian 
 And this from a person that never believed in religion 
 But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in 
 I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met 
 Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed 
 Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over 
 Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered 
 Then lost my faith again 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 What am I gonna do 
 Gotta have faith 
 Life is too much 
 I'm just through 
 Where is your faith? 
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...) 
 Faith 
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4 
 That's 4 innocent bastards cause Papa, they don't know 
 Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters 
 Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister 
 Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit 
 Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit 
 She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature 
 And maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for 
 Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help 
 Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself 
 She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice 
 That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice." 
 And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing 
 With those crazy ass people at the county building 
 Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way 
 Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8 
 Then lost her faith again 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 What am I gonna do 
 Gotta have faith 
 Life is too much 
 I'm just through 
 Where is your faith? 
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...) 
 Faith 
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed 
  
 [Verse 3: Punch] 
 I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa 
 Ask him why as my eyes fill up 
 Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas 
 It's jungle when the niggas in zoo 
 The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents 
 Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it 
 I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel 
 To make karma come faster than she normally will 
 It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me 
 It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy 
 I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout 
 But it never rain in California unless the pistols out 
 Until then, my feet planted on the ground 
 Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding 
 And if I get no answer, just know I tried 
 I should have never looked into his son's eyes 
 Rayshawn Boyce 
  
 [Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] 
 What am I gonna do 
 Gotta have faith 
 Life is too much 
 I'm just through 
 Where is your faith? 
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...) 
 Faith 
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard 
 Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?" 
 Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain 
 But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains 
 We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer 
 Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair 
 And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care 
 At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares 
 Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong 
 Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room 
 I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost 
 And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before 
 Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better 
 But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever 
 So the next time you feel like your world's about to end 
 I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'd rather not live like there isn't a God 
 Than die and find out there really is 
 Think about it[Intro] 
 The hardest thing for me to do 
 Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars 
 That's the hardest thing 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton 
 On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot 
 On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell 
 The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled 
 Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru 
 Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school 
 With that being said, each one of their rivals 
 Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival 
 Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back 
 And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes 
 In the midst of staying neutral and discrete 
 My momma said you're judged by the company you keep 
 But what you can consider, that if it goes down 
 They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga 
 So if you ask what I'm doing 
 I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it) 
 This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I was walking from Centennial 
 When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up 
 Where you from? "I don't bang" 
 Where you stay? "Westside", that's a Piru gang to be exact 
 Well aware they had blue across they hat 
 Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac 
 Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet 
 Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet 
 Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew 
 What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage 
 Never seen that many guns in my life 
 I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge 
 Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in 
 Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer 
 You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you 
 Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga) 
 This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I don't do black music, I don't do white music 
 I do everyday life music 
 Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it 
 You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold 
 And this is for my county building children 
 In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering 
 I use perseverance in this mad city 
 Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats 
 Bernie Mac died, it's no joke 
 Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves 
 Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life 
 I could fall out the sky like twice 
 And land in the land of the AKs 
 And the minivans where the fan never on 
 Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket 
 In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This is why they fuck with me (haha) 
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
  
 [Outro] 
 So there you have it 
 But I'mma leave you with this 
 An O.G. once told me 
 A real gangster is either dead or in jail 
 Or behind the scenes getting real money 
 I'm gone[Produced by T-Minus] 
  
 [Intro: Ab-Soul] 
 Playas always trying to pop bottles 
 Niggas love to pop bottles 
 Then get you a table my nigga 
 Get you a table my nigga 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Pour up, drank, head shot, drank 
 Sit down, drank, stand up, drank 
 Pass out, drank, wake up, drank 
 Faded, drank, faded, drank 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Rock] 
 No syrup in this cup but this that po' up 
 When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up 
 Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets 
 If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at? 
 One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober 
 Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis 
 One life, that's all we have, Ok lets toast to that 
 Then dive in a pool full of liquor 
 Swim laps like Michael Phelps 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots? 
 I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock 
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch 
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

 Pour up, drank, head shot, drank 
 Sit down, drank, stand up, drank

 Faded, drank, faded, drank 
  
 [Verse 2: Ab Soul] 
 Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize 
 Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away 
 Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose 
 With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken 
 You with it? (Soulo) 
 Spread your wings, you probably won't get far 
 I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car 
 Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya 
 And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots? 
 I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

 [Verse 3: Schoolboy Q] 
 So it's that groovy little nigga 
 Known for popping them bottles 
 Under my pants be a golden dick 
 Bitch, everything about me solid 
 Burberry nigga, them be my draws 
 Alexander McQueen in closets 
 Swagged out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh 
 Have that pussy throbbing 
 Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that 
 Twisting off them molly caps 
 Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose 
 Can I get a shot, swim in your juice 
 Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat 
 I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet 
 Bitch did you see your tab receipt?

 (Sherane) 
 Aw man... where is she taking me... 
 Where is she taking me... 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All I, all I, all I, all I 
 All I have in life is my new appetite for failure 
 And I got hunger pain that grow insane 
 Tell me do that sound familiar? 
 If it do then you're like me 
 Making excuse that your relief 
 Is in the bottom of the bottle 
 And the greenest indo leaf 
 As the window open I release 
 Everything that corrode inside of me 
 I see you joking, why you laugh? 
 Don't you feel bad? 
 I probably sleep, and never ever wake up 
 Never ever wake up, never ever wake up 
 In God I trust 
 But just when I thought I had enough 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 More, more, bless me more 
 We gon drink this mothafucka down, more 
 Bottoms up then we pass it round, more 
 Fill it up more, not enough, more 
 Bless me more 
 We gon drink this mothafucka down, more 
 Bottoms up then we pass it round, more 
 Fill it up more, not enough, more

 I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor) 
 And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city) 
 So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing) 
 Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)

 [Verse 1] 
 Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was... 
 I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac 
 Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95 
 People staring at 'em in amazement 
 Reservations at the Days Inn 
 We was living out a hotel at the time 
 Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried 
 Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move 
 When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job 
 Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion 
 Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin' 
 Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies? 
 Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies 
 Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers 
 But never make the visit, if better days was on its way 
 Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn 
 So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn 
 Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When we grow up we gon go and get us a million 
 Am I right? 
 Spend it all in front of the county building 
 Oh! 
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah 
 Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along 
 When we grow up we gon go and get us a million 
 Spend it all in front of the county building 
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

 [Verse 2] 
 Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit? 
 Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh) 
 Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that) 
 Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't) 
 Looking out the window, notice all the essentials 
 Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle 
 Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental 
 Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you? 
 I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials 
 Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take 
 Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks 
 They did invasions while helicopters recorded it 
 Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers 
 Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it 
 The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses 
 Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is 
 "Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it 
 If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich 
 Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb 
 If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget 
 Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither 
 Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping 
 And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it 
 Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots" 
 That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King... 
 You was with your daddy on Bullis Road 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When we grow up we gon go and get us a million 
 That's crazy 
 Spend it all in front of the county building 
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane 
 Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along 
 When we grow up we gon go and get us a million 
 Please sing 
 Spend it all in front of the county building

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs 
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's 
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love 
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club 
 I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05 
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job 
 Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans 
 Trust me these niggas rushed me for somethin my cousin prolly did 
 Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga 
 You gon make me flip and split yo shit, judge give me life, nigga 
 Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers 
 Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover 
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin 
 Maintaining my modest modus as I dream 
 So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it 
 Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry 
 ("Hey what's up daddy?") 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright

 "So what'd you rush me out here for? 
 How was your day? Are you tipsy?" 
 "Mhm!" 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patron 
 Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on 
 Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw 
 Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do? 
 Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is? 
 Go on poke it out, situate your little positives 
 How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready 
 I'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me... 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff 
 I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe 
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff 
 I can't get enough if I offend you... 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home 
 And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats 
 And it made me think if we could blink 
 To change locations where we at 
 We often get lost in the alcohol bottle 
 In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow 
 Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit 
 Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted 
 Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright 
 But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life 
 You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga 
 The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga 
 But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
  
 [Verse 4: Ab-Soul] 
 Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin? 
 Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram 
 Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them 
 One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me 
 And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man 
 What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it 
 Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open 
 Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open 
 (Soul!) Balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig? 
 Let's kill a bottle of tequila 
 And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya? 
 What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck 
 Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day 
 'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day... 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patron 
 Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on 
 Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw 
 Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do? 
 Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is? 
 Go on poke it out, situate your little positives 
 How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready 
 I'mma lay it down like a carpenter, when you let me...[Produced by Tommy Black] 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high 
 All we want to do is have a good time 
 Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life 
 Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho 
 Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high 
 All we want to do is have a good time 
 Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life 
 Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high 
 All we want to do is have a good time 
 Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life 
 Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one) 
 Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho 
 Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high 
 All we want to do is have a good time 
 Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life 
 Pray that we make it to twenty-one...[Intro] 
 One time, reporting live, Compton, California 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos 
 Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable 
 My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent 
 She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions 
 She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable 
 She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor 
 Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager 
 Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins 
 The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me 
 The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me 
  
 [Chorus: JaVonté] 
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm 
 Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear 
 View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer 
 Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends 
 Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success 
 Got a promotion, now she own the building 
 Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property 
 She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center 
 Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant 
 Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me 
 Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me 
  
 [Chorus: JaVonté] 
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated 
 She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good 
 Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's 
 Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple 
 Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too 
 On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm 
 She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms 
 Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting 
 He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me 
 Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me 
 I need her, we need we 
  
 [Chorus: JaVonté] 
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on[Intro] 
 Uh 
 A lil' Compton nigga 
 Just a lil' Compton nigga 
 One time for my niggas 
 You know Compton, nigga 
 Just a lil' Compton nigga 
 Kendrick Lamar 
  
 [Verse] 
 Back with a vengeance 
 Back with my heart and I'm venting 
 Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me 
 I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion 
 I believe there's one God, there's one love 
 And I believe if I fly, we all doves 
 I make a way for my people to see the light 
 Brighter than yellow bones 
 Me and my microphone could be one 
 Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this ain't Eazy 
 I can't take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win 
 The proof is in the pudding 
 And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right 
 By any means necessary get campaign right 
 Very emotional I'm a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author 
 A born starter, in the game for real 
 And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father 
 You can't learn if mistakes ain't made 
 You gotta pay homage in order to get paid 
 You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues 
 And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews 
 Lifestyles of the young and the broke 
 With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes 
 And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap 
 In order to see the front, I had to play the back 
 We played our position, we let ya'll play ya'll selves, ya'll made ya'll decision 
 We pray while we prey on competition 
 To flip another page of Corinthians 
 I see stars when I write these sentences 
 Words crash cars when I write these sentences 
 Open jail bars for my niggas life sentences 
 Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses 
 Ya'll better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel I'mma make ya'll suffer 
 And take ya'll supper 
 I haven't ate in the last 22 summers and I'm 22 now it's about to go down 
 So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe 
 Oh, I'm free 
 Finally I can say I'm me 
 The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP 
 The question concerns 
 I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs 
 Hope ya'll infected 
 Hope ya'll ain't have no protection 
 Still I'm progressing, room for improvement 
 Make room for the groom married to his music 
 I was at the XXL just trying to excel 
 Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning 
 Wanted to be apart of it cater it to my audience 
 J. Cole runnin' late 
 If he don't show up, think I can take his place 
 Ladies start laughing 
 No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic 
 Homie popped up with about twenty bags and 
 Fresh out the plane I couldn't even complain 
 My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name 
 Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya 
 Contributing the real shit 
 Talk about it make the people talk about it 
 Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat 
 Tell 'em build a boat like Noah 
 And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom 
 I ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to em 
 And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him 
 Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera 
 Then kill his manager 
 Then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's 
 On Rosecrans where you'll find me 
 And all my niggas is grimy 
 But I remain the good kid 
 Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live 
 Oh no we got to slow the city down 
 I told the homeboy pump his brakes 
 He said that he rather put the pump to his face 
 Sawed off 
 Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin' 
 Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come 
 Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done 
 A baby in there with it 
 She said postpartum did it 
 Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing 
 When he was undressing said it'll only be a minute 
 That's why I always think I'm kicking something with feeling 
 I should've been a dentist 
 I should've been a blizzard-cold 
 Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes 
 I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes 
 Tryna kill my dreams 
 Not elevate 
 Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight 
 With a little bit of passion 
 And a drive like an Aston 
 Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock 
 Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I 
 Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn 
 Lady G, Willy B in time 
 Ima blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines 
 Go like I never seen a red light shine 
 Flow to my heart, hit the flo' when im dying 
 Heart of a lion, tell em get in line 
 And pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes 
 If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime 
 Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond 
 Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns 
 Pad on the hill (as in a big house on the hill) that's a passion of mine 
 Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights 
 I'mma need two mics just to get my point across 
 I'mma get my joint across, country ya'll gon' want me[Produced by King Blue] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up? 
 I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up? 
 I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up? 
 Well, alright 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron will make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs 
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's 
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love 
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club 
 I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05 
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job 
 Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans 
 Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did 
 Guilty by association story of my life, nigga 
 You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga 
 Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers 
 Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover 
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin 
 Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream 
 So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it 
 Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron will make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely 
 Surrounded by the irony of living in the city 
 I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat 
 And the only thing can help is ass and some titties 
 So what's up, baby? I said what's up? 
 I had a long day and I really wanna fuck 
 See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills 
 Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID 
 Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots 
 Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block 
 Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear 
 You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears 
 Or run through a pothole at two in the morning 
 Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it 
 See I know when the harsh reality take it's toll 
 Open up your contacts then scroll 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron will make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
  
 [Verse 3: Ab-Soul] 
 Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin? 
 Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram 
 Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve 
 Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd 
 Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck 
 Convertibles with turbo jets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh 
 I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver 
 So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina 
 My sky's gray, my bitches brighter 
 Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer 
 And I'm the God MC, join my diocese 
 Free your mind, don't mind society 
 And finally, everyone got their own problems 
 Everything is subject to change like broken dollars 
 I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina 
 Like a piranha fin it, gets harder than Rihanna when 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm going through something with life 
 But pussy and Patron will make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel alright 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice[Verse] 
 It's been a week already, feeling weak already 
 Got me at peak, possibility of what could be 
 Situation is heavy, I've got to prove 
 On February 26th I lost my life too 
 It's like I'm here in a dark dream 
 Nightmare, hear screams recorded 
 Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was 
 That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood 
 Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch? 
 And for our community do you know what this does? 
 Add to a trail of hatred 
 2012 was taped for the world to see 
 Set us back another 400 years 
 This is modern day slavery 
 The reason why I'm by your house 
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch 
 I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out 
 Every piece of your brain 
 'Til your son jumped in your arm 
 Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain 
 I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk 
 Had the vodka on the top 
 How come I can long time 
 How come I could make it popular? 
 Puff on what I want 
 How come I could make it popular? 
 Puff on what I want 
 See I'm living with anxiety 
 Giving up sobriety 
 Cussing with his sister 
 And playing with society 
 Justice ain't free 
 Therefore justice ain't me 
 Try and justify staying, obituary 
 Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart? 
 Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God 
 Now I'm thinking to myself 
 Hollow tips is all I got 
 Now I'm drinking by myself 
 At the end of Section Park 
 Caught you when you walk besides your house 
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch 
 I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out 
 Every piece of your brain 
 'Til your spine drip to your arm 
 Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith 
 I said Hiiipower, one time you see it 
 Hiiipower, two times, you see it 
 Hiiipower, two times you see it

 [Chorus] 
 She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie 
 Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien) 
 And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space 
 UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 She got me going, I'm all in 
 Fifty stories, I'm falling 
 Where you been? Is it planet Mars? 
 Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian? 
 You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya 
 Energy sending me towards the ceiling 
 I'm high now, are you up there? 
 If you was, I would climb every other stair 
 I gotta stare, I mean wow 
 And I'm wowed, no one compares 
 A one-on-one, you must have won 
 Every pageant in America when you was young 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Lips, hips, hair drips down her back 
 (Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy) 
 The only girl that can make time 
 Then make me, stop...

 So now we on, so now we going 
 Living in the city of the unknown 
 I show her off, I stunt with her 
 We do it sweet, they look bitter 
 Look at her get up, I hear 'em say 
 But why him? I hear 'em hate 
 I laugh at it rather than jab at it 
 Then continue eternal life as a crack addict 
 Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug 
 Cold turkey? No sir 
 You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above 
 You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

 Lips, hips, hair drips down her back

 [Outro] 
 You something different, I'm glad I found you 
 So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you[Intro] 
 Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you 
 Man... 
  
 [Hook] 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 I can daydream about Beyonce all day 
 Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay 
 See ya know 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 I really thought I had a chance to be your man 
 Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand 
 It hurt me so 
  
 [Verse 1 - Kendrick] 
 I remember you were 16 on the TV screen with Wyclef 
 Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed 
 You was like "no no no," I was like 12 years old 
 Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road 
 You wore braids with a bangin body 
 Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably 
 But bump that, I was there from the start 
 Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart 
 Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so 
 They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo 
 No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin' they cool 
 But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman 
 And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton 
 Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand 
 Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it 
 Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished 
  
 [Hook] 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 I can daydream about Beyonce all day 
 Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay 
 See ya know 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 I really thought I had a chance to be your man 
 Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand 
 It hurt me so 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD 
 Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me 
 She jealous of you cause I don't love her like I love you 
 I even make her do the "uh oh, uh oh" just like you do 
 She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect 
 Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud 
 She's like "you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke" 
 I said "So? I'm only 500 mill away, theres still hope!" 
 Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid 
 And I didn't laugh when you busted your ass on the stage 
 And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you 
 I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you 
 But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack 
 What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico? 
 He used to be my favorite until he abandoned my diva 
 Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on "ether" 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 I can daydream about Beyonce all day 
 Thinkin' about the good times 'fore she met Jay 
 See ya know 
 They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay) 
 Hopefully I still have a chance 
 Maybe if I sabotage your man 
 You never know, hmm... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'mma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert 
 With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z 
 And push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips 
 That's when I yell out "Sounwave! Hurry up take the pic!" 
 Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right 
 Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight 
 Better yet, I'mma steal her cell, then call up Affion 
 He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line 
 Then make up some bogus shit like "You don't rub the back of my knees right 
 So this marriage is over with 
 And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it! 
 [Cling]...you heard the sound so you know I did" 
 Haha that should get 'em 
 That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that 
 I'mma put the plan in motion, that's for sure 
 But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work 
  
 [Outro - Skit] 
 Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song 
 Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse 
 Like right before I come in 
 Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot for real though? 
 Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you 
 Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit 
 Run that back though?[Samples]

 Kendrick Lamar 
 To... to... 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you 
 Scared of you but I will fight you 
 I stare at the ceiling and think about you 
 Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you 
 You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder 
 Why you love people that love people that do right? 
 Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type? 
 One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers 
 Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool 
 Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you 
 You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed 
 And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit 
 But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot 
 But I'ma still send this letter off 
 P.O. Box, and when you get it.... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Because it's personal 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you 
 Scared of you but I will fight you 
 Should be ashamed of the moves you make 
 The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break 
 Everyday you remind me that you're always there 
 'Cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down 
 And all I say is a prayer, "so help me, Lord!" 
 Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy!" 
 That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth 
 And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt 
 Of knowing that you're everlasting 
 Dwelling upon the masses 
 Of the Earth fatal assassins 
 Snatchin' bodies 
 Probably, on my notepad as I write 
 Why the fuck you wanna take my life? 
 Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor 
 So when I write on this paper 
 It's real talk 
 So... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Because it's personal 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar as Death] 
 Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too 
 And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever since grade school 
 I've watched your every move 
 You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass 
 So don't say I ain't sympathetic 
 But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it 
 Everybody wanna know why I act this way 
 Let's just say... I had a bad day 
 Matter fact, everyday 
 But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade 
 I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat 
 Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at? 
 Not me, see me? I'm just doing my job 
 And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd 
 So why send this letter as if I never knew you? 
 I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you 
  
 [Interlude: Ab-Soul] 
 It's everywhere 
 The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, hospitals 
 Heard about it when I was little 
 Tomorrow's not promised, 'cause any day can be knocking at your front door 
 War, genocide, homicide, suicide all coincide 
 Signed and sealed by the living 
 Make it, don't take it 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Because it's personal[Intro/Hook] 
 When the sun fall out the sky 
 All I have is me in the land of do or die 
 A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind 
 Now, that's the ultimate high 
 To the cloud I go, cloud I go 
 One time, baby tell me ya need me 
 Cloud I go, cloud I go 
 Two time, baby tell me ya love me 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much 
 We ain't been keeping in touch 
 Fell into lust, where is the love? 
 My independency got tendencies of lack of trust 
 I look at the street corners as my new woman 
 Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments 
 And luckily, being in denial ain't the case 
 Cause I know she's unfaithful 
 Instead I'm grabbing her waist 
 And every part of her is tasteful 
 I know you're feelings hating 
 In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know 
 Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me 
 I get the vibe you might need some time to grow 
  
 [Hook]

 Cloud I go, cloud I go 
 Two time, baby tell me ya love me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much 
 We ain't been keeping in touch 
 And every time that I think of your touch 
 Adrenaline pump, give me that rush 
 I'm going like a thief inside the wind 
 Lord forgive me for my sins 
 I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins 
 She said I found the root of all evil 
 And lost a friend 
 Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton 
 That never knew love because love was never promised 
 I know.. selfish as I wanna be 
 And every time I'm under you, me too 
 Need time to grow..

 Said I'm a fuckin' monster 
 A massive attack I haunt ya 
 Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors 
 Mastered that after that I went for thermometors 
 Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica 
 Holla back they promised us 
 No pajamas insomnia 
 Will attack, I attack like piranha does 
 Hit your block like a comet (BLAHH!) 
 And you all know what time it is 
 2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap 
 Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented 
 I'm in a jungle what's wild enough 
 Just might stumble upon a pack of lions 
 No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq 
 Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep 
 My science applyin' pressure her stretcher is needed pay the proceeds 
 Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet 
 You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette 
 My flow got the ceiling wet 
 I spit 'til I feel my breath 
 Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest 
 She fuckin' the fuckin' best 
 Mean my dick is the dick of death 
 Means I'm killin that pussy 
 Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yeah Dre 
 Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin' 
 Whether you storm to your climate 
 Whether your beat makin' or rhyming 
 Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman 
 Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans 
 On a island with Ray Bans 
 Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs) 
 I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum 
 Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum 
 Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible 
 They probably call the federal after I slaughter several 
 Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas 
 They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch 
 And Top Dawg can vouch bitch 
 Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits 
 The generals here 
 That mean the hustlers and the criminals here 
 Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it 
 Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it 
 Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet 
 Put me in a category 
 I don't know what's a sadder story 
 Guts and glory 
 Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it 
 I take you to a block where they Crippin 
 Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen 
 Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it 
 Show me somethin' different 
 You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance 
 You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics 
 Who your boss, he more like my assistant 
 Get lost have a egg and a biscuit 
 Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits 
 Pay cash when your chain come up missin' 
 Q...Q 
  
 [Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q] 
 Double up, shit, what the fuck? 
 Get me some my promo poppin' 
 Setbacks droppin' 
 Soon they watchin' 
 I just lock and load explode 
 Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed 
 Marriotts and Swisher Sweets 
 LA nigga prolly east 
 Cheerin' for the ragin' beats 
 X O henny scrape the keif 
 Bangin C I'm bangin' B 
 Put them niggas next to me 
 Stop and focus get the lead 
 I'm here now let the hardest speak 
 Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period 
 Run on sentence still I'm ventin' 
 Air conditionin' coolest breeze 
 Ill diseases 
 Grip my penis, shoot my semen 
 Still I'm comin', miles a runnin' 
 I was learnin' getting knowledge 
 Head is throbbin', she's a goblin 
 We be mobbin' over bitches 
 Stick and miss and she the business 
 Get a witness pussy frenchin 
 Yes, a mission 
 Poppin' off like on a mission 
 Proposition, gettin' money 
 Drop a nigga, rush a nigga 
 Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga 
 Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga 
 Heatin' up the winnnin nigga 
 Somethin' to remember nigga 
 Hella sick, I got a spit 
 Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit 
 Load the clip Heckler & Koch 
 The hoover king 
 Bada bing by the ding a ling 
 Natural hoover 
 Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine 
 Asian from Beijing 
 Money make her cum, she C.R.E.A.M 
 Feed the weak that's Wing Stop 
 At the start with rain drops 
 Autobot 
 Space shuttle shittin on your car lots 
 Boy style 
 Could at least got a saturn, huh? 
 HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh? 
 Workin' on tracks like we never been free

 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR 
 Please come to friend zone 
 But don't wowwy 
 You will not suck on my dick tonight[Intro: Female] 
 I miss you (I miss you, I miss you) 
 Where you been? (Where you been?) 
 It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you 
 It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me 
 Come back, I need you in my life (Come back) 
 I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you 
  
 [Verse 1: Dom Kennedy] 
 What's up baby? (What's up baby?) 
 It's been a while (Been a while) 
 You been good? (Been good?) 
 I've been around (Uh) 
 Different girls (Where?) 
 Different towns (Yeah) 
 To keep it real (Keep it real) 
 You missing out (Uh) 
 I’m on board, next city (Onboard, next city) 
 Random call, text with me (Random call, uh) 
 Like, I miss you so much, have sex with me 
 Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me 
 She like fuck that (Fuck that) 
 I don't care Dom (Care Dom) 
 So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom (Fair Dom) 
 Meet me here, where Dom? (Meet me here, where Dom?) 
 Get undressed, yeah Dom (Uh) 
 Yeah Dom, what you need? 
 Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah) 
 Good food? Japanese? (Yeah, yeah) 
 That's me on page forty in that magazine 
 “Dom Kennedy” you need that 
 She said nobody come close, I agreed back (Uh) 
 I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back (Yeah) 
 And she need me, believe that (Yeah) 
  
 [Chorus: JaVonte] 
 That girl is smoking 
 And can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain't hard to see she got me open 
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What's up love? (What's up love?) 
 It's been a while (Been a while) 
 You been good? (Been good?) 
 I've been around (Uh-huh) 
 Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh) 
 Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright) 
 Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright) 
 Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True) 
 I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
 You got over him when I got in between 
 Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious 
 For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished 
 But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together 
 Every time I put the head in you would panic 
 And come right down like an avalanche 
 Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants 
 Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir 
 Wake it back up, Folger's holsters 
 By my waistline, shot for your heart and 
 You called it a hate crime, say you want me back 
 And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit 
 4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that? 
  
 [Chorus: JaVonte] 
 That girl is smoking 
 And can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain't hard to see she got me open 
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on 
  
 [Verse 3: MURS] 
 I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause 
 She need me, I got that Jon Brion love 
 Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk 
 We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch 
 You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out 
 My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out 
 There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout? 
 We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house 
 Smoking beedies, laying on the futon 
 Memories I got saved up like a coupon 
 And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed 
 I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed 
 Then she would just leave in a black hatchback 
 Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that 
 I would say “Yep”, smiling so freely 
 That was back then, but I bet she still need me 
 She need me, she need me 
 She need me, she need me 
 I would say “Yes”, smiling so freely 
 That was back then, I bet she still need me 
  
 [Chorus: Javonte] 
 That girl is smoking 
 And can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain't hard to see she got me open 
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on[Intro] 
 K-Dizzle 
  
 [Verse] 
 I rap with a Pyrex in the projects 
 I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect 
 I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope 
 I can dissect any rapper 
 You could vote for the Lochness 
 You can not test no King in a Tesla 
 Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside 
 And my young niggas came with the extras, ah 
  
 [Hook] 
 It's Alive...[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 One time 
 Reporting live 
 Compton, California 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life? 
 Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep? 
 Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep 
 Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet 
 Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter 
 And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her 
 I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing 
 I was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly 
 They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25 
 And if I survive it's probably with a celly 
 My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats 
 In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's 
 They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets 
 Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed 
 Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues 
 BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm 
  
 [Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Female Vocalist] 
 In the club like fuck it, though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say I can't live comfortable 
 I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass 
 Celebrate the very day that I get past 
 Through the barbed wire 
 We are, we are (fine) 
 We are, we are (true) 
 Through the, through barbed (wires) 
 We will, will break (through) 
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass 
 Celebrate the very day that I get past 
 Through the barbed wire 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life? 
 Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep? 
 Tryna get away from the world's stereotype 
 Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately 
 In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying 
 She gon have a baby then flee from her education 
 At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes 
 See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality 
 She'll never get by, no how, no way 
 Welfare recipient, property of the state 
 Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute 
 The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute 
 Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies 
 And this baby daddy is new to the family 
 Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first 
 Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Female Vocalist] 
 In the club like fuck it, though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say she can't live comfortable 
 She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass 
 Celebrate the very day that she get past 
 Through the barbed wire 
 We are, we are (fine) 
 We are, we are (true) 
 Through the, through barbed (wires) 
 We will, will break (through) 
 So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass 
 Celebrate the very day that she get past 
 Through the barbed wire 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Have you ever felt like, you finally got life 
 You finally got right? No longer a black sheep 
 Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian 
 In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married 
 What a feeling of overcoming the odds 
 It's like we just hit the lottery, my God 
 There must be a God, cause golly 
 You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali 
 Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs 
 And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks 
 And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar 
 Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind 
 And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way 
 Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day 
 But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth 
 You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out 
  
 [Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Female Vocalist] 
 In the club like fuck it, though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say I can't live comfortable 
 I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad 
 Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path 
 Through the barbed wire (just laugh) 
 Then everybody say... 
 'Cause I won't get caught again 
 And I'm here to stop the trends 
 You can catch me if you try 
 Disappear into the night 
 And I'm gone 
  
 [Interlude: Female Vocalist & Kendrick Lamar] 
 So you made it past all the barbed wires? 
 There's one more left *Gunshot*[Intro: JaVonté] 
 In time you'll learn this is about you 
 In time you'll learn this is about you 
 In time you'll learn this is about you 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Babies from 80's don't know—know no better 
 Don't nothing go better with ignorance 
 But the belligerent kids that we living with 
 Some of them masculine, some of them feminine 
 'member the universe used to be innocent 
 Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants 
 Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again 
 I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80 
  
 [Outro] 
 Show of hands, how many been taking notes? Good. Leave everything on the table now. Vulnerability, this is your generation. Show, show your pain[Spoken intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated... 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream? 
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened? 
 And real life situations was artificial 
 They say we only living to, die 
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell 
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves 
 Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense 
 It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him 
 Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids 
 Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale 
 Cus' we ain't gonna win 
 Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen 
 (shit) 
 Don't mind me I'm just thinking again 
 Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud 
 Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes 
 Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers 
 Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes 
 It's not a game, it's nothing to play with 
 Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay 
 Struggle that is 
 I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life 
 That means what I'm thinking is right 
 Punch, loop the beat for a minute 
 Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home 
 Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon 
 Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back 
 If dreams was reality 
 If it was cool for you to be a casualty 
 The only way that you can escape poverty 
 Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time 
 You're listening too far if you hear this part 
 I suggest you go back and press rewind 
 I fast forward to common thoughts of a human 
 Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint 
 Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix 
 Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music 
 O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it 
 Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving 
 Direct them to a casket 
 Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want... 
 If they wanna see reality [haha] 
 I'm losing you again ain't I? 
 Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states? 
 Black President, they don't wanna see that 
 It's evident...pain is pain 
 We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness 
 I swear to God that we live in a Matrix 
 Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships 
 Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best 
 Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect 
 We learn to live with it I guess 
 I mean die with it, since we're already dead 
 Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time 
 Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down 
 Teach you about the things that we live around 
 Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in 
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch] 
 When the dreams was reality and money was love 
 What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity 
 Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity 
 Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty 
 American dream or Scarface fantasy 
 Kilos of coke and the arms of black families 
 We use to it, our hearts draped in stone 
 A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home 
 Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash 
 End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast 
 Now another mother screams picking out his casket 
 Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not 
 It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life 
 And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice 
 The streets mowed him, can't make past that 
 It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh] 
 What happened in Manhattan happens all the time 
 In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime 
 No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness 
 I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president 
 World trade happened on the world stage 
 Same stage look at us as some educated apes 
 On video stations women gyrating 
 Parading around, mind-raping the youth 
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream? 
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened? 
 And real life situations was artificial 
 They say we only living to, die 
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell 
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves 
 Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway 
  
 [Outro: Denzel Washington] 
 I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da.. 
 Who the fuck d'ya think you fuckin' with? I'm the police! 
 I run shit here, you just live here![Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Everybody, just clap your hands if your a real 
 Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel 
 Be yourself, just show me you're real 
 Middle fingers up 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down 
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I just wanna be me 
 No disrespect, but motherfuck you 
 My education stopped at a high school degree 
 But I can outsmart any high IQ 
 Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum 
 Cold, my style making my nose run 
 Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me 
 Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink 
 Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit 
 Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks 
 So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit 
 And California on that jerk shit 
 But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps 
 Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests 
 Yes 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down 
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali 
 But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis 
 And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick 
 I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit 
 Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor? 
 Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa 
 You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids 
 Won't you lighten up like Michael did? 
 I grew up with killas man, people who killed men 
 But my character never could be like them, man 
 And they respect that, say that I'm real man 
 Not a fake person, that's the Sims man 
 Live my life through some film, man 
 I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows 
 Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho 
 And oh 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down 
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Almost lost my life to the industry 
 Had to look through a photobook to remember me 
 These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit 
 Have you with professional killas, chasing hits 
 Lying to yourself, all over an image 
 Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance 
 My Mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you." 
 I said, "This is the sound, though." 
 My only excuse 
 Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie 
 And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me 
 The reason why they hate, is cause these motherfuckers ain't me 
 And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth 
 A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter 
 Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner 
 See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender 
 To make sure that you feel me 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 Just let me be me 
 That's the only way I know 
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down 
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down 
  
 [Interlude: Female Voice Speaking] 
 Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 Kendrick Lamar, is this really you? 
 Is this who you are? What are you trying to say? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 Kendrick Lamar, who are you? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I think that I finally reached the pinnacle 
 Of finding myself as an individual 
 The world is so typical 
 I just wanna be higher than that 
 I used to want to be the messiah of Rap 
 Infatuated with becoming a relevant star 
 Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars 
 That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad 
 Vanity, they say that it can damage me 
 So do I really want it? 
 If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect 
 That means I'll be frontin' 
 Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story 
 That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me 
 Knowing that I'm misunderstood 
 So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would 
 And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there 
 Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair 
 And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty 
 And all I could say is, "Will the radio care?" 
 Yeah, or should I say no? 
 Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach? 
 You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old 
 Well that was me then, now I'm an adult 
 22, like the smallest of guns that you know 
 Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show 
 But I'm not worried 
 My talent should take me places I've never been 
 The world should turn as soon as my records spin 
 I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit 
 The negative you bring, the stress, the violence 
 The capital punishment, the loud police sirens 
 Too focused, one word, righteous 
 And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll 
 That means I wanna be the highest 
 Too focused, one word, righteous 
 That means I wanna be the highest 
 Too focused, one word 
  
 [Outro: Female Voice] 
 Too focused, too focused, one word 
 Too focused, too focused, one word

 Weezy wassup with it bruddah? 
 Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick 
 Hear me? 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride 
 Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 That's no lie, ho 
 Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go 
 Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face 
 Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face 
 .38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry 
 Housing authority saved my Section 8 
 My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ 
 Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp 
 Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out 
 I'mma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out 
 Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise 
 Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B 
 I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms 
 Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth 
 You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth 
 I put my hand on the bible 
 Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow 
 Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner 
 They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach 
 I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me 
 Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all 
 Would never stop what you can't see 
 It's like a red light when driving with Stevie 
 Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath 
 I steer the game with both hands while you crash 
 Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers 
 You can either ride, or get rolled over 
 Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma 
 So please chill out before you meet the coldest 
 Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is 
 Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it 
  
 [Hook] 
 Hold it 
 I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride 
 Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 21 gun salute 
 And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time 
 And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana 
 Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5 
 Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie 
 I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme 
 All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line 
 All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived 
 God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time 
 I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine 
 I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9 
 Straight up, fuck around and get ate up 
 Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for 
 Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats 
 To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won 
 I'm the one 
 The beat was the pussy 
 And I cum, hard[Excerpt from "Mortal Man"] 
  
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn’t wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga[Intro: Angela McCluskey] 
 Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it) 
 What's behind the other door, oh 
 No more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love 
 Just searching for the perfect shot 
  
 [Hook: Angela McCluskey] 
 When love comes calling, don't love back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I used to write rhymes, all day and all night 
 While you were playing Playstation, my pencil was erasing lines 
 My conscious only knew whats half tight 
 At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga 
 This is a dog's fight, my nigga 
 The soundtrack to life, my nigga 
 Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that 
 He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks 
 Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack 
 He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs 
 Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back 
 Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack 
 That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win 
 You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin? 
 Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers 
 The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome 
 Where is the love? 
  
 [Hook] 
 When love comes calling, don't love back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Give me rings, give me chains, mane 
 Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range 
 Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes 
 A mansion with marble floors and security codes 
 Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5 
 Clearport,say hello to the man 
 Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud 
 My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords 
 Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses 
 With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements 
 Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for 
 Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured 
 Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity 
 Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be 
 Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts 
 And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me 
 And that's love 
  
 [Hook: Angela McCluskey] 
 When love comes calling, don't love back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away

 Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration[Produced by Jairus 'J-Mo' Mozee] 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now 
 Like should I start trapping? If what I write down 
 Don't collect this very moment then I'm on it, no question 
 In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see 
 Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E? 
 Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep? 
 This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat 
 I be in spots chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet 
 This is me frustrated, battling my own evils 
 Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo 
 Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip 
 And hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler 
 Rather records on the needle, making music 
 Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing 
 My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me? 
 "I thought you had a show?" Well ma nigga I guess I didn't 
 I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting 
 Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines 
 Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up 
 Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough 
 This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution 
 Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting 
 2-11's with Mac-11's like fuck Hip Hop 
 Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be 'Pac 
 Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got 
 Or everything getting shot, for nothing 
 Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling 
 Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor 
 Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma 
 Then expand to the Hoover dam, water 
 Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked 
 Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds 
 I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down 
 And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me 
 You'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing 
 But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten 
 My future financially, so please don't be mad at me 
 I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit 
 So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip 
 Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit 
  
 [Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 There are times, when you need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines 
 Special for you, and me yeah 
 I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances 
 Before they pass, they pass, they pass 
 Pass me by, oh darling 
 You've got to look at the other side

 R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience[Produced by Tommy Black] 
  
 [Intro: Ab-Soul] 
 My nigga, what it look like? 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin' 
 Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying 
 Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism 
 Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure 
 Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality 
 Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan 
 Not to mention another prison, child molesting 
 Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested 
 Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested 
 Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message 
 To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map 
 Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap 
 Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying 
 The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin' 
 These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph 
 Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion 
 See that's forbidden, we fryin' 
 My nigga, what it look like? 
 That's exactly what Hell look like 
  
 [Chorus: Alori Joh] 
 Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy 
 Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up! 
 Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy 
 Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up! 
  
 [Interlude: Ab-Soul] 
 My nigga, what it look like? 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin' 
 Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing 
 Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens 
 Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...[Verse 1] 
 Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry 
 Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie 
 Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride 
 Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe 
 Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out 
 This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside 
 When my world collide 
 With your world where your girl and your kids reside 
 We killed the facades, we feel free to fly 
 We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky 
 I care about my pride too much 
 If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush 
 If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed 
 I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong 
 Insecurity roams the black community 
 Homes where kids must have jewelry 
 The high school female need earrings and details 
 So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity 
 The various name brands that reached the price scan 
 It's not about the right price but more like the right scam 
 To rule us all, confuse us all 
 Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw 
 Now let's draw 
 The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for 
 My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house 
 That lives around his neck like a white collar 
 So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times 
 Picking cotton from a field that a white man own 
 The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home 
 Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity 
 Before your vanity, they parted our families 
 They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed 
 The more we were afraid, the more they made rules 
 And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague 
 Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross (uh) 
 And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts 
 And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar 
 400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering 
 400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation 
 See what we facing is now coming back to the roots 
 Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot 
 Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit 
 Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do 
 Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to 
 About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie 
 Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me 
 She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though 
 We filling up the gas for Rollies 
 Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes 
 My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya 
 He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors 
 So blame it on the 400 years we never saw 
 The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss 
 Slaves 
  
 [Outro] 
 I said the 400 years we never had nothing 
 Barely had clothes on our back 
 Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change 
 We over exaggerate on our living expenses 
 So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger 
 Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it 
 And on the back of the window it says, "Get on my level ho" 
 You're a vanity slave 
  
 We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said 
 Can somebody please tell me where the mall at? 
 I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho? 
 Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in 
 I'm tryna get some 
 What up?[Verse 1] 
 I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't 
 No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick 
 Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given 
 The only thing that I can identify within this business 
 I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap 
 Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap? 
 I never killed a man, never sold any crack 
 All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map 
 But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win 
 I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends 
 So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul? 
 I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no" 
 They say anything worth having is worth the wait 
 Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes 
 There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short 
 Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown 
 I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it 
 You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business? 
 A rich nigga buy anything you sell him 
 A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him 
 Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you 
 Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 See I was brought up different 
 Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen 
 You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it 
 It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it 
 Oh-no-oh-oh 
 I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by 
 My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie? 
 And if you ain't trying to win, then why try? 
 Now you can low-ball or give me high five 
 This is I nigga, look into my eye 
  
 [Hook] 
 Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar 
 Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar 
 I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar 
 I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all 
 Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 And that used to be a hell of a task 
 Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass 
 My character like it don't carry a confidence 
 That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash 
 I'm bout to cash in my thoughts 
 Give you a compass, then tell you get lost 
 What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom 
 Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him 
 Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit 
 When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government 
 These are big dreams, tansition from a rapper to a human being 
 You can't 'school' a dean 
 I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience 
 All cause they all oversaw it, my God 
 Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience 
 All because who I are, Lamar 
  
 [Hook] 
 But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar 
 Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar 
 I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all 
 Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go 
  
 [Outro] 
 But we can't go... backwards[Verse 1] 
 Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior 
 I never felt the feeling of euphoria 
 Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong 
 Wake up in the morning and I gotta win 
 Not taking the victory, that's my only sin 
 And so I send a message to your messenger 
 A warning shot to let em know I'm serious 
 I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window 
 The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you 
 On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks 
 I can crack every code you deliver, I attack 
 Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod 
 Even if you try hard, he can still die hard 
 Run but you can't hide: white flags 
 You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye 
  
 [Hook] 
 I will, I will climb the highest mountain 
 Before the flood comes 
 And all my fight is drowning in blood 
 What I got to lose? What I got to prove? 
 I guess war is my love 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing 
 You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it 
 Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out 
 And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6 
 I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick 
 I lead the pack, I follow no rules 
 I see the traps, I know you're close to 
 Falling on your face, unload, reload 
 Hand me another case, explode, explode 
 The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise 
 I know you hope your help is close by 
  
 [Hook] 
 I will, I will climb the highest mountain 
 Before the flood comes 
 And all my fight is drowning in blood 
 What I got to lose? What I got to prove? 
 I guess war is my love[Hook: Tame Impala] 
 Only go backwards, lately 
 Every part of me says go ahead 
 I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again 
 Feels like we only go backwards darling 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules 
 Feel the energy we go through, I told you 
 Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you 
 My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool 
 Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame? 
 See my generation has no shame, I play the game 
 How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to 
 I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya 
 Out your power position, my army head-on collision 
 Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance 
 Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin' 
 Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition 
 I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's 
 This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours 
 This is more than C4, this is what happens when 
 We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy 
  
 [Hook: Tame Impala] 
 It feels like I only go backwards, lately 
 Every part of me says go ahead 
 I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again 
 Feels like we only go backwards darling 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me 
 Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me 
 System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me 
 I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me 
 With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin' 
 Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless 
 I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it 
 Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance 
 Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy 
 This is me changing faces cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride 
 The victory of fight is all in my eyes 
 The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it 
 You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous 
 Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated 
 The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce? 
  
 [Hook: Tame Impala] 
 It feels like I only go backwards, lately 
 Every part of me says go ahead 
 I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again 
 Feels like we only go backwards darling 
 It feels[Chorus] 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu 
 Look at the life that I been through 
 We the last real niggas alive, that’s official 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 Let me tell you when it all started 
 Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies 
 It was a classic album, but prior to that 
 Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax 
 A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them 
 But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope 
 Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner 
 Many years went by, still no legitimate answer 
 Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade 
 Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave 
 And his brother designed, put together the music 
 Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid 
 With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills 
 Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real 
 Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement 
 Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape 
 Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break 
 But never got a response.. anyway 
 This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera 
 I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after 
 It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton 
 Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin' 
 But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me 
 Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet 
 Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour 
 Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour 
 Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape 
 Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed 
 But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap 
 Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track 
 He got signed months later, Warner Brothers 
 We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper 
 Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone 
 Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone 
 He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it 
 Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget 
 Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life 
 But not knowing how to market it right 
 Turned on the radio 
 Only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop 
 And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous 
 In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft 
 What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up 
 It was a hit 
 When I heard it 
 But all we had was the instrumental and the hook 
 But when 
 Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash 
 Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion 
 Next thing you know, the record was 
 Spinning 
 That was a good look, it set the coast on fire 
 Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot 
 Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station 
 Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about? 
 Shit was funny to us tho 
 Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo 
 In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy 
 I had a situation with Def Jam, premature 
 Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care 
 I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect 
 See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock 
 Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot 
 Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it 
 Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant 
 But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game 
 And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy 
 Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, "Wow" 
 These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise" 
 Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that 
 But right after that, we didn’t see him no more 
 G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon 
 Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm 
 Then everybody start to scream out the new West 
 And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best 
 I think that’s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight 
 Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice 
 Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet 
 But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about 
 And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too 
 It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves 
 Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop 
 Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group 
 Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native 
 We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it 
 By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves 
 We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne 
 That part I'mma leave out 
 Theres certain things that the streets only should know about 
 Shout out to Nipsey 
 Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O 
 That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me 
 Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it 
 That’s a goddamn power move stupid 
 You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit 
 Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu 
 Look at the life that I been through 
 We the last real niggas alive, that’s official 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu 
 Look at the life that I been through 
 We the last real niggas alive, that’s official 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too 
 And said he was partners with Game 
 The nigga finally told me what he said 
 He said he didn’t like it 
 But the niggas like 
 “See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight” 
 Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit 
  
 [Ended with shout outs][Intro] 
 I remember, uhh 
 When my uncles 
 Served smokers 
 On Alondra 
 In front of our building, they was my heroes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, and that's scary to me 
 Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me 
 Especially when Sounwave is on his P's 
 Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord 
 Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys 
 This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain 
 And I bang like a C-R-I-P 
 P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP 
 I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot 
 A needle in your veins, take it in vein 
 Or itch till your eyeballs pop 
 I'm cold on the cold turkey 
 I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies 
 Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Uhh, and it's scary to me 
 Every listener is a strawberry to me 
 You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease 
 Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up 
 A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese 
 -Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn? 
 Curl up like Big Worm when I drop 
 Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops 
 I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock 
 That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops 
 I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that 
 Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on? 
 If ain’t about me about ho it be about face 
 If you ain’t on higher—learning 
 There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Uhh, and it's scary to carry 
 A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot 
 That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo 
 When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap 
 And I rap like a nigga who invented rap 
 Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat 
 If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet 
 I suppose this is bigger than life 
 This is probably everybody, Illuminati 
 Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party 
 I undress her like a Harley 
 Lights will flash, cars will crash 
 Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh 
 So my bad if I put you in rehab 
 You are reimbursed, put it on my tab 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes 
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe 
  
 [Outro] 
 Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro[Intro] 
 It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know? 
 I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap 
 I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers 
 I'm the oldest, nigga 
 And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z 
 Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me 
 I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable 
 Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do 
 Because I used to practice early morning and then after school 
 I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you 
 But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you 
 Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut 
 I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane 
 Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand 
 Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto 
 As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror 
 I wear a heart on my shoulder 
 'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola? 
 Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over 
 Then went to jail when we got older 
 That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused 
 In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline 
 That shit's embarrassing huh 
 Hope no one pay you no mind 
 But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line 
 Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams 
 And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen? 
 My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio 
 Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo' 
 My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed 
 But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD 
 How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga 
 At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga 
 It's a sacrifice I try to tell him 
 That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous 
 Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit 
 I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit 
 I just wanna hear you heard 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yep, yep, that's my word 
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs 
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb 
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard) 
 Like a cattle with sheep 
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day 
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory 
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'mma be heard 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga 
 You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga 
 You believed in me first, that's what's for sure 
 At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked 
 But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion 
 A lot was going on in your life and you needed space 
 But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened 
 But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away 
 And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done 
 But I'm telling you we ain't done 
 Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to? 
 Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools? 
 People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning 
 With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it 
 Me, you and Dave was on it 
 Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped 
 Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked 
 Time to be heard 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yep, yep, that's my word 
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs 
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb 
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard) 
 Like a cattle with sheep 
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day 
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory 
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'mma be heard 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So can you feel it? 
 When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit? 
 Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick? 
 The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing 
 Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave? 
 That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays 
 Like a dog in the night 
 Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes 
 To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite 
 I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one 
 With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible 
 Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad 
 You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad 
 Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas 
 I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city 
 My niggas, tell me you with me 
 And if you is won't you pop my CD in 
 Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard 
 Yeah, uh huh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Yep, yep, that's my word 
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs 
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb 
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard) 
 Like a cattle with sheep 
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day 
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory 
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'mma be heard 
  
 [Outro] 
 D-Dave, what up nigga? 
 Matt Jeezy, hahaha...[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this! 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan 
 Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune 
 Thank God for these rap recordings 
 I can ball like him on every verse and chorus 
 501s, Louis letterman jacket 
 Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes 
 You know that Compton ghetto shit 
 That every section 8 tenant is familiar with 
 Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s 
 But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes 
 You got 80 sevens 
 Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy 
 Fucking all my high school teachers 
 That was '05 bro 
 And I don't like 'em if the ass thin 
 And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend 
 The fuck I look like? 
 A million bucks, and that's why 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it 
 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it 
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it 
 She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho) 
 Uh, So give me fifty feet champ 
 Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp 
 I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp 
 And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp 
 You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing 
 105 off-ramp, hey 
 And little nigga got it going on, G5 
 Going, going, going, gone 
 Cloud 9 mind state 
 I drop a record then I raise the crime rate 
 Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie 
 A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 Bitch, I do this! 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock] 
 She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it 
 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it 
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it 
 She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it 
 First off I'm a rider, bitch 
 Put them 26's on a Silverado, bitch 
 I keep my bitch with a finer bitch 
 Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch 
 Tell them fuck boys that I do this 
 Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas 
 Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up 
 Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts 
 And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy 
 Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti 
 Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga 
 When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 The definition of cool is 
 Boy I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do thisGimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali 
 I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws 
 The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall 
 If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval 
 I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all 
 I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me 
 Mos Def, word to every autopsy 
 Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz 
 'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave 
 He changed his name, he a conscious rapper 
 Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper 
 I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get 
 But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers 
 Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again? 
 Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is? 
 We not like like Christ is 
 We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this 
 People don't understand why I went southpaw 
 I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all 
 I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy 
 To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy 
 Cause my shit different 
 I know 
 He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before? 
 Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid 
 Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs 
 To get out Chicago 
 To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto 
 I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe 
 Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o 
 Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him 
 Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him 
 That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em 
 Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em 
 So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from 
 Where my heart turned numb 
 And the powder and the shells come up off that gun 
 Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son 
 It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind 
 'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin' 
 No one preventin' this war 
 You sure, you sure 
 Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore 
 The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month 
 Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut 
 I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up 
 Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck 
 Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad 
 Shit I write ether 
 I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit 
 With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts 
 This is very extra necessary 
 This extra scary, this is Amityville 
 This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills 
 And if I can't do it my integrity will 
 Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is 
 I mean this shit is 
 Fucking ridiculous 
 Fucking ridiculous 
 They all got a fat ass but lower case titties 
 Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black 
 Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact 
 Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog 
 Just to read my twitter blog 
 Man these hoes pitiful 
 And to you bloggers that say I'm weak 
 You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat? 
 Y'all don't 'preciate shit 
 All y'all do is hate shit 
 And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit 
 And that's ridiculous 
 I mean that shit is 
 Fucking ridiculous[Poem] 
 Ahhh! Ahhh! 
 I remembered you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 Lucifer was all around 
 So I kept running 
 Until I found my safe haven 
 I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got 
 Making myself realize what my foundation was 
 (In the room, and I run it) 
 (Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!) 
 But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Ay on my momma nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg) 
 I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit 
 On my momma doe like 
 On the dead homies 
 Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga 
 Turn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga 
 Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me? 
 Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free 
 To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD 
 Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC 
 (Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!) 
 Nigga, now R.I.P 
 My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy 
  
 [Intro] 
 Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
 Alls my life I... 
 Hard times like, "God!" 
 Bad trips like, "Yea!" 
 Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
 Homie you fucked up 
 But if God got us 
 Then we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Huh? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, and when I wake up 
 I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
 But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down 
 What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life 
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
 Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
 Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows 
 20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me 
 Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come 
 And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record 
 I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record 
 Tell the world I know it's too late 
 Boys and girls, I think I gone cray 
 Drown inside my vices all day 
 Won't you please believe when I say 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, been down before 
 Nigga, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" 
 Nigga, and we hate po-po 
 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho 
 Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door 
 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow 
 But we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Huh? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 What you want, you a house, you a car? 
 40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar? 
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall 
 I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal 
 I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero 
 Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal 
 Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you 
 Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
 In the presence of your chico... ah! 
 I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel 
 If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you 
 Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all 
 Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all 
 I rap, I black on track so rest assured 
 My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, been down before 
 Nigga, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" 
 Nigga, and we hate po-po 
 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho 
 Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door 
 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow 
 But we gon' be alright 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Huh? We gon' be alright 
 Nigga, we gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Outro] 
 I keep my head up high 
 I cross my heart and hope to die 
 Lovin' me is complicated 
 Too afraid, a lot of changes 
 I'm alright, and you're a favorite 
 Dark nights in my prayers 
  
 [Poem] 
 I remembered you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn't wanna self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers[Produced by Mr. Bangladesh] 
  
 [Intro] 
 (Top Dawg, Money GANG) 
 Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me 
  
 [Verse] 
 Look, I say I'm a millionaire 
 I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox 
 I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got 
 I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott 
 Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers 
 Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards 
 Stepping on em' like a Kappa 
 Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters 
 So where do I go now 
 Swear there is none after 
 I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC 
 And you don't want to get caught in the rapture 
 I would probably burn your whole colony 
 Chew you up then spit you out 
 Your nothing but a Polla Seed 
 Follow hood policies 
 Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be 
 You never seen a killer til you seen one on side of me 
 That green on the side of me 
 Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like Assadomy 
 Fuck them bitches properly 
 I do it 
 I do it, done it run it like I grown legs by the hundreds 
 My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry 
 Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs 
 Bummy, NEVER 
 Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather 
 And get ready for the detonation 
 I bomber whoever 
 Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life 
 I steered right through your fan base every time 
 Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines 
 Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways 
 I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave 
 Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is I sasquatch can rap 
 Motherfucker I'm iller 
 Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track 
 The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?" 
 There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac! 
 I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie in fact 
 He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat 
 He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back 
 I think that boy from Iraq , I think y'all boys better know that 
 He got it on lock like a Low Jack 
 Heading straight for the top like a ball cap 
 Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where ya'll came from 
 Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top 
 Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food 
 Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me 
 Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea 
 Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker 
 Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock 
 On your side motherfucker, side motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker 
 When I go pop pop 
 Open up close shop like a retail spot 
 Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie 
 Bitch thats no lie, let the truth be told 
 K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up 
 Rappers: I'm iller 
 Dig it, like it, love it a lot[Intro] 
 Reporting live, Compton California 
 The good kid 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm tired of doing it the same way 
 Gotta Flip it before I ruin it 
 Make it all make sense 
 Before you put your 2 in it 
 Opinions get thrown out the window 
 With Ron Browz so turn me up loud 
 So the world can hear 
 And when your favorite rapper 
 Be rapping you should cover your ears 
 And go deaf, go deaf I said 
 Go death and stay dead 
 A shot to the forehead'll kill em 
 But I ain't here for no ignorance 
 I’m militant, as Martin Luther King 
 In the penitent, aiming for my dreams 
 Till a bullet bounce off 
 One of my deep thoughts 
 And hit a nigga in the spleen 
 I got it in my genes 
 You probably think I'm talking bout a pistol 
 But I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior 
 My nigga what you worry for? 
 I ain't trying to jock your swag 
 I'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant 
  
 [Hook] 
 Yeah, as time flies 
 Hope that I'm soaring 
 Far from the boring 
 I'ma 
 Tell you why 
 It's important 
 I'm not the boring, (I'ma) 
 If I think and act like you do 
 The world would die 
 From not seeing something new 
 And if I don't speak on how I feel 
 The world would lose out on 
 What's really real 
 And if I should die before I wake 
 I pray my music will take my place 
 The World 
 The Relevant 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Id rather you call me that 
 Then a typical artist you call wack 
 On a Youtube blog holding AR's and stacks 
 Of one's but never could be the one 
 To rally communities or 
 Lead a crowd of blacks 
 Passion is to strong 
 Im pissed off 
 So there's a chance you get pissed on 
 R Kelly was in the wrong 
 But that dont make you an exempt 
 That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence 
 You ain't a blood and 
 Damn sure you ain't a crip 
 The crowd yell OH! 
 But I ain't a pimp 
 Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount 
 See you on the flipside 
 Right after I dismount, if I 
 Ever feel like I ain't pushin myself 
 Ill find a cliff then push myself 
 Off the edge like a barber 
 At the tip of your head 
 Thats how I settle it 
 Life or death if I ain't relevant 
  
 [Hook] 
 Yeah, as time flies 
 Hope that I'm soaring 
 Far from the boring 
 I'ma 
 Tell you why 
 It's important 
 I'm not the boring, (I'ma) 
 If I think and act like you do 
 The world would die 
 From not seeing something new 
 And if I don't speak on how I feel 
 The world would lose out on 
 What's really real 
 And if I should die before I wake 
 I pray my music will take my place 
 The World 
 The Relevant 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So feel free to not mind me 
 If your used to boosters 
 Drug dealers and shooters its on wax 
 Cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway 
 I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play 
 Like a 2 on 2 orgy 
 But I been there and it bores me 
 Got to the point where it did nothing for me 
 At 40 I want to afford not to record bullshit 
 In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now 
 Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory 
 Victory is here, if I cried 
 You could see strength and pride in my tears 
 I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23 
 Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen 
 And my pen is the only thing I got for 
 Hip hop to change the game 
 They'll remember my name as the relevant 
  
 [Hook] 
 Yeah, as time flies 
 Hope that I'm soaring 
 Far from the boring 
 I'ma 
 Tell you why 
 It's important 
 I'm not the boring, (I'ma) 
 If I think and act like you do

 The Relevant[Kendrick Lamar] 
 See y'all don't understand me 
 My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy 
 Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan 
 Marching on Rosecrans in Compton 
 You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit 
 I'm on point like period 
 I've been there and gone before you get near it 
 Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther 
 The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters 
 Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in 
 Family, God and honor 
 From Chicago, my daddy and my momma 
 Came to Compton to accomplish one thing 
 Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick 
 I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one 
 My unborn son and grandson will live royal 
 From the coochie to the soil 
 The meek shall inherit the Earth 
 Well I've had this world since birth 
 Feel the good kid's hunger 
 The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger 
 Muscle in my heart 
 Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius 
 Do my dougie and grab my penis 
 Cause I means this with all my soul 
 And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan 
 But even that can't stop it 
 Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic 
 Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me 
 And if you say it ain't, you may offend me 
 Damn that boy good 
 Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood 
 He stood alone for so long 
 Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here 
 You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Intro] 
 For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little 
 I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack 
 No really this a Sounwave track 
 So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it 
 When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it 
 I came back with a full time swag 
 And the critics thought they had me 
 Nah, I just bought more batteries 
 Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large 
 Matter fact where my niggas at? 
 Where my bitches with them pretty weaves? 
 Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one 
 I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia 
 Good kid, mad city evil in my heart 
 From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me 
 Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate 
 It's a legitimate reason why 
 I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky" 
 But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God 
 My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend 
 Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings 
 I put a lot of pain in the shit I write 
 If you going through something, this the shit you recite 
 This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar 
 This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that! 
 Yeah, straight like that 
  
 [Hook] 
 People don't be shy 
 Release them balloons to the sky 
 I need the world to celebrate me! (One time) 
 You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga! 
 Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga! 
 That's a quote from Ab-Soul 
 I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal 
 On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous 
 Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit 
 Big ass, big tits she on me 
 And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies 
 The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said 
 "Just do you, nigga!" Show and prove, nigga 
 And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure 
 'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!" 
 I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's 
 Back in the city and tipping on four hoes 
 That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on 
 Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh 
 Straight like that 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Why y'all complain about OG's? 
 I don't look at a legend and say you owe me 
 Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube 
 I don't care me and Quik went to the same school 
 I look in the mirror and do it myself 
 Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga 
 Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga? 
 They can make me much bigger 
 But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow 
 The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost 
 "Me Against The World" on you mothafuckas 
 I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker 
 Uhh, tryna record my steelo 
 Even when I'm not there just like TiVo 
 The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego 
 And weed move slow right now but E go 
 You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars 
 To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real 
 And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse 
 Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh 
 Just like that 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1] 
 Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner 
 At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a 
 Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters 
 Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water 
 Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water 
 Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow 
 It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it 
 Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks 
 Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom 
 Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal 
 Open the doorway to his soul 
 Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle 
 Aim it at your arteries pardon me, parts of me is pyscho 
 In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note 
 Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note 
 My innocence would eventually see a hindrance 
 Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis 
 Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling 
 Something my papa said that caught my attention 
 His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven 
 He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven 
 The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime 
 Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign 
 Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind 
 Even if he sat me down in the sunshine and gave me those eyes 
 Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself 
 He said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't help 
 So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go 
 Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll" 
 Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though 
 Til the day he carried by the big six, domino 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Backpack raps with gats in it 
 Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace 
 K Dot Thoroughbred 
 Move like a militant soldier 
 On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with 
 With the best shit 
 Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are 
 This is it 
 I'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day 
 Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves 
 Trying to convince hoes I got good hair 
 Knowing damn well there's chemicals there 
 I'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol 
 And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know 
 Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo 
 I spawned with a dragon 
 He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him 
 Came out the battle laughing 
 That's a metaphor for any rapper who want it 
 I smack em 'til their nose is running 
 You know the hoes is coming if I'm there 
 And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel 
 That's no assumption, cool out before I move out 
 Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out 
 The back seat 
 There's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not Dot 
 Tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break 
 You probably think I'm dope like the it's the realest shit I wrote 
 But to me it's a throw away 
 I stare at them four walls and rap like I'm mad at God 
 Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay 
 Matter fact, no, I take that back 
 See I don't play with real legends of rap like you do 
 And I'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos 
 And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!Part I: XXX

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101 
 Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds 
 He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk 
 Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done 
 He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? 
 Been a messed up day for me 
 Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome." 
 He was lookin' for some closure 
 I can bring him closer 
 Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him 
 "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel: 
 If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed." 
 Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of 
 All the memories collected, moments you could never touch 
 I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block 
 I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got 
 I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap 
 Walk myself to the court like, "Man, I did that!" 
 Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward 
 I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours 
 It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour 
 Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial 
 Let somebody touch my mama 
 Touch my sister, touch my woman 
 Touch my daddy, touch my niece 
 Touch my nephew, man, I promise 
 You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap 
 Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention 
 Call you back— 
  
 The screen reads: "This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar" 
  
 [Chorus: Bono & Kendrick Lamar] 
 It's not a place 
 (Uh-huh) 
 This country is to me a sound of drum and bass 
 You close your eyes to look around 
 It's not a place 
 (Uh-huh) 
 This country is to me a thought that offers grace 
 For every welcome that is sought 
 Part II: DNA 
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice 
 On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice 
 Run your life, I live a-- 
 Run your life (ahh) 
 This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin' 
 Money and power, the mecca of marriages 
  
 Tell me somethin' 
 Uh, you can't tell me nothin' 
 I'd rather die than to listen to you 
 My DNA not for imitation 
 Your DNA is an abomination 
 This how it is when you in the Matrix 
 Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow 
 And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go 
 And sleepin' in a villa 
 Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin' 
 Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor 
 Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window 
 Baby in the pool, godfather goals 
 Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer 
 Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera 
 Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals 
 Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana 
 Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes 
 Phone never on, I don't conversate 
 I don't compromise, I just penetrate 
 Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks 
 These are the times, level number 9 
 Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way 
 Sentence on the way, killings on the way 
 Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way 
  
 [Spoken: Dave Chappelle] 
 Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue...

 He want some lot with new Bentleys again 
 I want some top from like two sets of twins 
 Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Red light, green light, red light, green light 
 Red light, green light, they like, we like 
 Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads 
 Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God? 
 Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it 
 I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in 
 Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background 
 Absent, never OG, standout 
 Lackin' everything else but doubt 
 Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum 
 Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud 
 Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope 
 They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"

 Never had friends, never had ends 
 Never had hope, they was like "nope"

 Tee off the day 
 Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate 
 Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head" 
 Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge 
 Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings 
 Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family 
 Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives 
 Who am I? Not your father, not your brother 
 Not your reason, not your future 
 Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory 
 Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit 
 Not your message, not your freedom 
 Not your people, not your neighbor 
 Not your baby, not your equal 
 Not the title y'all want me under 
 All hail King Killmonger[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yeah, Kendrick Lamar 
 This for the town, nigga 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building 
 Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings 
 I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest 
 Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less 
 Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard 
 Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks 
 Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral 
 But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too 
 Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go 
 Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown 
 Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes 
 Murders in July, call that summer time madness 
 Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg 
 Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard 
 Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive 
 Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in 
  
 [Chorus: Alori Joh] 
 Compton, concrete jungle 
 Where dreams are made of 
 There's nothing you can't do 
 Now you're in Compton 
 These streets will make you or break you 
 Expire or inspire you 
 Let's hear it for Compton 
 Compton, Compton 
  
 (Verse 2) 
 Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me 
 Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week 
 Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days 
 Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played 
 21 outside maybe sideline pop 
 Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped 
 Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young 
 Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun 
 Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police 
 Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me 
 Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here 
 Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears 
 Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there 
 Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah 
 Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans 
 Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for.. 
  
 (Chorus) 
  
 (Verse 3) 
 I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park 
 Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village 
 Cedar Block, Santana 
 Burgundy and Blue bandanas 
 Peace! Peace! 
 Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street

 Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC 
 Peace! Peace! 
 Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155 
 Compton Swamps, Holly hood, T Zones 
 All a nigga really want for us to keep 
 Peace! Peace! 
 But shit that a take some time and more time 
 But I'm pushing to get us there in no time 
 Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love 
 Word to the county building forever I do it for...

 Alright, here we go, third take (Dead) 
 Rigamortus Remix, it feel good 
 Real quick Ali (Kendrick Lamar, fuck it up this time) 
 Haha, yeah 
  
 [Chrous: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic 
 I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
  
 (He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch 
 (He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die 
 Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind 
 I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined 
 I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline 
 I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9 
 And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky 
 And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me 
 That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite 
 And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride 
 Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die 
 A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide 
 CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 (He dead, amen) That's what they telling me 
 Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony 
 Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's 
 Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me 
 That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail 
 To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe 
 Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence 
 Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D 
 Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q 
 Solar system and barbeque, ain't nothing else you can do 
  
 (He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him 
 (He dead) Haha (Amen) Amen 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead) yup-yup (Amen) I know 
 (He dead)  fo' sho (Amen) Amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA 
 My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor 
 We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster 
 Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy 
 I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come 
 A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money 
 The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete 
 I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks 
 And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC 
 Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see 
 Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast 
 And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T 
 And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry 
 Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery 
 And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity 
 And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see 
  
 (He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know 
 (He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen 
  
 [Chrous: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know 
 (He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen 
  
 [Verse 4: Busta Rhymes] 
 Pull up and park in my Caddy 
 That's when I fuck it up badly 
 Frankly, I'm happy to tell niggas 
 "Have manners 'front they daddy" 
 I carry the Anthony Mackie 
 And put holes in you badly 
 Fuck sending you off in a hearse 
 I'll send you off in a taxi 
 Have you bloody leaky looking like you tampon or maxi 
 Retaliation talk (Shut the fuck up nigga!) Exactly 
 Nasty the classy the flashiest how I'm on it 
 Don't ask me no kind of questions and mention 
 I'll leave your face in a pantry 
 And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin' your face up like acne 
 Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Little Scrappy 
 Feeling like growing my dread again 
 Letting my shit get nappy 
 Throw me on a New York fitted 
 While reppin' like I'm a Yankee 
 If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em 
 Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi 
 When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist 
 Governor Pataki 
 Papi, here to massacre aunti 
 Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming 
 I'mma hit him in the front, hit him in the back 
 So substanc-y 
 Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley 
 You don't really really know how you niggas always be making me aggie 
 Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy 
 Haggling niggas with scriptures I'm spittin, you should be happy 
 Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly 
 In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties 
 It's the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy 
 And when it comes to murkin' something you should never put it past me! 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] : 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic 
 I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch 
 (He dead) I killed him (Amen) Amen[Verse 1]

 Go getter, with no cheddar 
 Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater 
 My life is likely to see great endeavors 
 But I can't win if I can't get it together 
 What I gotta do in order to see success? 
 Having the world's best to call me the best? 
 Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed 
 With an address linked to a beautiful actress? 
 A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole 
 Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes 
 That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition 
 But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches 
 Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy 
 When she wearing a tight belt 
 The homies on the block can say whatever they say 
 I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates 
  
 [Hook: Ash Riser] 
 In time, it'll come 
 Just stay focused and humble, my son 
 Show and prove, prove you're the one 
 It's not about who is dopest 
 Who wants it the most 
 So just go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What I gotta do in order to see success? 
 Having the world's best to call me the best 
 Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed 
 With an address next to a beautiful actress 
 Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin' 
 Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing 
 Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin' 
 Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon 
 Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose 
 Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay 
 Area or carry the birds to VA 
 Let the Clipse distribute the work all day 
 Then come back home 
 Every three weeks flip three to six zones 
 Homies on the block can say whatever they want 
 I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a trump 
 Donald that is 
  
 [Hook 2: Ash Riser & Kendrick Lamar] 
 In time, it'll come 
 Just stay focused and humble, my son 
 Show and prove, prove you're the one 
 It's not about who is dopest 
 Who wants it the most 
 So just go out and get it 
 (And when I do I do it again 
 Then I go back 
 When I do I do it again 
 Then I go back 
 Thug it out) 
 Go out and get it 
 (But for now I'mma go head and doug it out 
 I gotta rhyme, rhyme) 
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So welcome to the story of my life 
 See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write 
 Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife 
 Pops engine in this old school run tiiight! 
 But as you listening to K-D-O-T 
 Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC 
 She listening to Drake and all I can say is "Damn 
 These niggas that much better than me, baby?" 
 I don't think this is meant to be 
 Cause I'm always losing self esteem 
 She paused the iPhone then said, "Huh?" 
 I repeated what I said then she replied, "Shut up." 
 You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it 
 But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it 
 And never listen to what the industry say 
 Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay 
 Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid 
 Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah 
 So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps 
 Rising to the top like a soda shook up 
 Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way 
  
 [Hook: 1] 
  
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
  
 [Verse 1: Y-O] 
 Now I prefer women with some sexy toes 
 With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables 
 Seem like everybody love the role of assholes 
 But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes 
 Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking 
 Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln 
 I hear they fell in love with my penis 
 Only concerned with my balls like Venus 
  
 [Verse 2: Thurz] 
 Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot 
 Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top 
 Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch 
 And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock 
 Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot 
 U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop 
 On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me 
 I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
  
 [Verse 3: Skeme] 
 Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again 
 Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in 
 Burn a swisher up, then I roll again 
 Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah! 
 Got the world going crazy 
 Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me 
 Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling 
 So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it 
  
 [Verse 4: Brown] 
 Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me 
 She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie 
 Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing 
 We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci 
 Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me 
 T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County 
 Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras 
 Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance 
  
 [Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 The homies say I'm the truest 
 The bitches think I'm the cutest 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 The definition what cool is 
 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch, I do this 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 These hoes want to love me, man 
 So I'm like, what up? Uh what up? 
 Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting 
 That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses 
 Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won 
 Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously 
 I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude 
 You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you 
 Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC 
 I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony 
 I am the messiah of society 
 Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui 
 I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief 
 Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Bitch, I do this 
 Bitch, I do this 
 The definition what cool is

 [Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar] 
 You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous 
 I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous 
 You don't know how long it took to finally come alive 
 So bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating 
 Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations 
 You don't know how much I had to give to come alive 
 So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look inside of my soul 
 And you can find gold and maybe get rich 
 Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist 
 I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life 
 I always knew life can be dangerous 
 I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless 
 You don't know what pain is 
 How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you 
 Fell on my face and awoke with a scar 
 Another mistake living deep in my heart 
 Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick 
 I can admit that it did look like yours 
 Why you resent every making of this? 
 Tell me your purpose is petty again 
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love 
 You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does 
 And I'm looking right past you 
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles 
 You live in a world, you living behind the mirror 
 I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain 
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain 
 Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame 
 On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box 
 I'm a break out and then hide every lock 
 I'm a break out and then hide every lock 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I'm yelling 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé] 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time 
 Don't you see that long line? 
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth 
 Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync 
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings 
 Now what you better do 
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive 
 My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution 
 Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music 
 I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe![Part I: u]

 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I place blame on you still, place shame on you still 
 Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel 
 Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors 
 Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours 
 But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special 
 What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several 
 Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin' 
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience? 
 Where was your antennas? 
 Where was the influence you speak of? 
 You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
 I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader! 
 I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you! 
 The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
 Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication 
 Thought money would change you 
 Made you more complacent 
 I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 
 I swear— 
  
 [Hook] 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

 Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof 
 I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me 
 Yes, I hate you, too

 House keeping 
 (Knocking) 
 House keeping 
 ¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
 ¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
 ¡Disculpe! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You the reason why mama and them leavin' 
 No, you ain't shit, you say you love them 
 I know you don't mean it 
 I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it 
 Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
 Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
 You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
 Where was your presence? 
 Where was your support that you pretend? 
 You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple 
 You ain’t no friend 
 A friend never leave Compton for profit 
 Or leave his best friend, little brother 
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
 Where was your antennas? 
 On the road, bottles and bitches 
 You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven 
 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit 
 Guess you thought he would recover well 
 Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
 Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed" 
 You ain't try 
  
 [Part II: For Sale?] 
  
 [Intro: Bilal] 
 Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh 
 Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh 
 (Breathing) 
 What's wrong, nigga? 
 I thought you was keeping it gangsta 
 I thought this what you wanted 
 They say if you scared, go to church 
 But remember, he knows the Bible too 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you 
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you 
 'Cause I (want you) 
 Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty 
 Registration is out of service 
 Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving 
 'Cause I (want you) 
 (I want you more than you know) 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby 
 You looked me in my eyes about four, five times 
 'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified 
 That I (want you) 
 You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
 I said, "You crazy?" 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you 
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You said to me 
 You said your name was Lucy 
 I said, "Where's Ricardo?" 
 You said, "Oh, no, not the show" 
 Then you spit a little rap to me like this 
 When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit" 
 You said to me 
 I remember what you said too, you said 
 "My name is Lucy, Kendrick 
 You introduced me, Kendrick 
 Usually I don’t do this 
 But I see you and me, Kendrick 
 Lucy give you no worries 
 Lucy got million stories 
 About these rappers that I came after when they was boring 
 Lucy gon' fill your pockets 
 Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton 
 Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
 Lucy just want your trust and loyalty 
 Avoiding me? 
 It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly 
 Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute 
 Lucy work harder 
 Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
 I'm Lucy 
 I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly 
 Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
 Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
 Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork 
 I want you to know that Lucy got you 
 All your life I watched you 
 And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you 
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you

 Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving 
 'Cause I (want you)[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway 
 No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way 
 Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks 
 Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but nevermind that 
 Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at 
 You know where my grind at 
 Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at 
 Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax 
 Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit 
 Pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop 
 Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot 
 I don't even trip though I don't need no company 
 Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company 
 Kendrick the Good Kid 
  
 [Hook] 
 As I move 
 I feel way better doing me 
 I can only do me 
 I hope that, you do you 
 I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me 
 Some people say that I'm rude 
 But I don't give a damn if she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool 
 Nothing will change now I feel me today 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Nigga what I compose be so potent 
 That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean 
 Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin' 
 I'm not boasting or bragging 
 Not a person, I'm a dragon 
 Taking action in the heat of the night 
 So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright 
 I'm so high off life that I can OD 
 Walk outside then sniff a whole key 
 Oh lady don't call the police 
 It's just the Average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix 
 Don't be afraid to speak 
 So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach 
 Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat 
 You can never co-exist with my mommas oldest 
 Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right 
 My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write 
 Ink over my brain, Wussup! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So let me start off the third verse 
 Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed 
 Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion 
 Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons 
 Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing 
 Fuck you because you don't see my vision 
 I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute 
 And the ass look like a grenade within the denim 
 Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches 
 Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers 
 Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living 
 Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching 
 And whether you fuck with me or not 
 I don't give a fuck you could keep your props 
 Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K.Dot 
 Kendrick everyday, Jay-Z didn't lie 
 Fucka!

 24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always right on time 
  
 Oh, you thought you had me all figured out? 
 Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me 
  
 I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy 
  
 These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit 
 And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens 
  
 Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin' 
  
 But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Whoo Ha! 
 Backpack raps with gats in it 
 Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace 
 K-Dot thoroughbred 
 Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid 
 A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit 
 Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are 
 This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day 
 Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho 
 I been dope since S curl waves 
 Trying to convince hoes I got good hair 
 Knowing damn well there's chemicals there 
 I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol 
 And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes 
 And you know any moment you can lose your life 
 So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo 
 I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame 
 But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin' 
 That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it 
 I smack 'em til their nose is running 
 You know the hoes is coming if I'm there 
 And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel 
 There's no assumptions 
 Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105 
 Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat 
 (There's a dead guy on the freeway) 
 Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay 
 A beast when the beat break 
 You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote 
 But to me, it's a throw-away 
 I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God 
 Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas 
 Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back 
 See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do 
 I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo 
 And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Is it real son? Is it really real son? 
 Is it really real son? Is it really real? 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel son 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel 
 You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me 
 Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them 
  
 [Verse 2: Ab-Soul] 
 Come again, no introduction, you know my name 
 Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling 
 Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set 
 When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf 
 Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra 
 Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out 
 Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out 
 Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit 
 I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums 
 Like the measles when the record meets the needle 
 Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic 
 Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word 
 Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown 
 You need 54 cards, deal with it 
 You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it 
 Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game 
  
 [Verse 3: Punch] 
 Ay yo yo, the flow potent 
 Who's more focused? Kick doors open 
 Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking 
 It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken 
 The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship 
 Mind-bending, co-existing with the written 
 Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks 
 Translation, I'm disgusting in action 
 A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions 
 Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears 
 Mercury rising, I'm summer all year 
 I sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best 
 I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering 
 Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening 
 I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets 
 Peep the malice, I'm a monster 
 Ya boy running like William Joseph Crawford 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Is it real son? Is it really real son? 
 Is it really real son? Is it really real? 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel son 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel 
 You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me 
 Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them 
  
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Straight up, Don't get ate up 
 Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands 
 I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod 
 Even atheists play my shit and say, "My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice" 
 Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan 
 When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill 
 You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa' 
 Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up 
 See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stares 
 That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness) 
 I'm in the booth with an apron 
 Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen 
 Stay on the curb like a ? day tan? 
 Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard 
 We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best 
 Stay blessed, You can suck my dick 
 Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name 
 Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Is it real son? Is it really real son? 
 Is it really real son? Is it really real? 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel son 
 Tell me how you feel son. Tell me how you feel 
 You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me 
 Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them[Verse 1] 
 Rollin’ in a broken Mitsubishi with no AC 
 And a couple stolen TV’s and a seatbelt for my safety 
 Play the passenger, I think it’s five years after eighty- 
 Seven, do that math, 92, don’t you be lazy 
 I’m looking out the window, notice all the essentials 
 Of a block party that stopped for a second 
 Then it rekindled like the flame from a trick candle 
 Everybody got dental insurance, ‘cause we bout to floss 
 You get the couch I sent you? 
 I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials 
 Of a scholar, but should not today 
 Them Dayton spokes was his to take 
 Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks 
 They did invasions while helicopters recorded it 
 Hello, my Mr. Myiagi, I want them Kenwood Woofers 
 Say that you got me 
 If not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it 
 The swap meet was the bullseye like a Taurus is 
 Murder was the melody, you should know what the chorus is 
 You really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out? 
 He said “Lil nigga, today the poor is rich” 
 Don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb 
 And if she asks, just know that you have to lie 
 And son, don’t forget: 
 You from Compton 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Brace yourself, I take you on a trip down memory lane 
 This is not a rap on how I’m slinging brick and moving cane 
 Cul de sac and plenty Cognac in major pain 
 Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that’s weighing on your brain 
 It was me, O-Boog and Yaya 
 Lucky, ride down Rosecrans 
 Ugly, waving yo hand out the window, brace yourself, uh 
 Warriors and Conans 
 Euphoria can slow dance 
 Society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed 
 Light skinned nigga with his brains blown out 
 At the same burger stand where (mmm) hang out 
 Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it 
 But ever since that day, I was looking at him different 
 That was back when I was nine 
 Joey packed a nine 
 Pakistan on every porch, it’s fine 
 We adapt to crime 
 Pack a van with four guns at a time 
 Sliding door, fuck is up? 
 Fucking shooting forth, if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk 
 Picking up the fucking pump 
 Picking off you suckers, suck a dick 
 Die a sucker punch, a ball of bullets coming from 
 AK’s, AR’s, Aye y’all; duck 
 That’s what Mama said when we was eatin’ that free lunch 
 Aw man, god damn, all hell broke loose 
 You killed my cousin back in ‘94, fuck yo truce 
 Now crawl yo head in that noose 
 You wind up dead on the news 
 And no peace treaties just peace and BG’s appearing to prove 
 Bodies on top of bodies, IV’s on top of IV’s 
 Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys 
 When you hop on that trolly, your color’s correct 
 Make sure each corporate knows they’ll be calling your mother collect 
 Now, what you expect? 
 My life is a threat 
 Good kid, m.A.A.d. city 
 Life or death, is you with me? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Tim Westwood, what's upAbazaba 
  
 You know we get in the studio and do what we do best 
 You know 
 Beautiful shit 
 But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy 
 You feel me my nig 
 Hop on them keys real quick my nig 
  
 (Hook) 
 Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight 
 Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like 
 Yea hahaha yea 
 This shit my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight 
 I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like 
  
 (Verse 1: Kendrick) 
 Check me out 
 She say she love it when it sounds like this 
 She tell me Kendrick put it down like this 
 When I listen I wanna close my eyes 
 And feel your lips 
 Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips 
 So enticing 
 On point like the helmet of a Viking 
 Kicking up dust like I'm hiking 
 I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one 
 I be calling my woman so I could get some 
 She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard 
 She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard 
 Composing myself, tryna remain content 
 She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent 
 Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice 
 Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE) 
 Fuck that, option number deuce 
 On the kitchen table while I play this tune 
 You know why? 
  
 This shit my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight 
 I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like 
 Hahaha yea 
 This shit my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight 
 Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga 
  
 Look 
  
 (Verse 2: Kendrick) 
 We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam 
 I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m 
 It's a club banger 
 Catchy hooks and 808's 
 I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe 
 The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track 
 Even rewinding it back 
 Soon as the beat drop 
 The way she react she like "That's Hot" 
 'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got 
 How many I fucked 
 How many I've misled just to get a nut 
 Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch 
 Uh 
 Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit 
 I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate 
 She's so cool doe 
 Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo 
 She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo 
 And disregards to the provocative records 
 One thing that I do know 
  
 This something my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight 
 I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like 
 Told you that my girlfriend'll like 
 Other hoes tonight 
 Soul 
  
 (Verse 3: Ab-Soul) 
 This something my girlfriend'll like too 
 Kendrick I got you 
  
 This a great idea 
 This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here 
 So I'mma kick the shit she like 
 It seem right 
 Like a pair of jeans that fit tight 
 Around her cute booty 
 I like to hold her from behind in line 
 At the movies 
 Her body language gets read 
 Like a ruby 
 Cause she a work-a-art 
 No help from Julie 
 I'mma beast and she such a beauty 
 I love her, she know that, I place no one above her 
 Far from an arc, but best undercover 
 Kodak moment every time we in sync 
 Like a iPod plugged to a USB 
 It's just you and me 
 I mean me and her 
 I mean her and I 
 It's plain to see, affirmative 
 So if you ever need me 
 You know where Herbert is 
 On her mind 
 Like she on mine 
 Uh 
 Play some shit my girlfriend'll like 
 Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight 
 She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write 
 If she was me talking bout her 
 DJ 
  
 Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like 
 I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight 
 I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like 
 Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him 
 But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em 
 Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing 
 I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore 
 Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em 
 Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em 
 I guess I really am a vanity slave 
 I guess my ancestors turning in they graves 
 Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings 
 Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement 
 When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie 
 Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country 
 Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name 
 He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world 
 That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi 
 Try this on 
 If it ain't upscale then you may offend me 
 Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice 
 Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight 
 I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline 
 They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh? 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane] 
 Word around town that I'm all about the bitches 
 Word around town that I love my 26's 
 Word around town that I gotta stay paid 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 It's the Gucci cock and shoot 
 Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Aw man videos got me wanting hoes 
 Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose 
 A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed 
 By my people hell rose, Niggas that ain't had shit 
 For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear 
 Man y'all don't see my vision 
 I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches 
 Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting 
 I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right 
 My conscience tell me to stay righteous 
 It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it 
 Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly 
 But baby steps are premature remember? 
 I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November 
 To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane] 
 Word around town that I'm all about the bitches

 Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Cold, oh so cold 
 How ironic he bought it then sold his soul 
 Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll? 
 The remote control is taking control 
 Lift up the doors 
 That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue 
 I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both 
 Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs 
 Cause nothing goes bad, everytime I wear (Gucci) 
 I'm getting more ass, everytime I wear (Gucci) 
 They told me it's a fad, everytime I wear (Gucci) 
 But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie? 
 This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me 
 If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony 
 The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us 
 I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

 Ladies and gentlemen! My man, Kendrick Lamar! 
  
 [Kendrick & Background Vocalists] 
 Livin' in America 
 Thuggin' in the trap 
 Livin' in a groove 
 Watchin' TV 
  
 [Kendrick] 
 Dedicated to the homies in the pen', hit me! 
  
 [Intro] 
 I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yay yay 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
 But an enemigo never drown me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (And I love myself) 
 Uh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high 
 (I love myself) 
 Uh, one day at a time, sun gon' shine 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy) 
 What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?) 
 Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) 
 Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
 How many times my potential was anonymous? 
 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this, huh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I love myself) 
 Uh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy don't seem shy 
 (I love myself) 
 One day at a time, sun gon' shine 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 When they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street 
 Gun in the hood, mob of police 
 Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme 
 (These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation) 
 Ah man 
 (I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis) 
 Uh, dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast 
 Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now 
 The strong in me, I still smile 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I love myself) 
 Huh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy 
 (I love myself) 
 One day at a time, sun gon' shine, everybody, hit me! 
  
 [Bridge] 
 (Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet) 
 (Down, down valley deep, down, down valley deep) 
 (Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum) 
 (My heart undone, my heart undone) 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin' on right now, ya feel what I'm talkin' bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what I'm talkin' bout? This here's the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me! 
  
 [Original Chorus] 
 And I love myself 
 (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
 I love myself 
 (But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind) 
 I love myself 
 (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
 I love myself 
 (One day at a time, sun gon' shine) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I went to war last night 
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
 I'ma do it till I get it right 
 War last night 
 I've been dealing with depression, duckin' every other blessin' 
 I could never see the message, I could-- 
 I could never take the lead, never bob and weave 
 Negative letting them annihilate me 
 Evident I'm moving at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a building, lay my-- 
 Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street 
 Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen 
 Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen 
 Seen enough, make everybody scream, "I love myself!" 
  
 [Original Outro] 
 I lost my head 
 I must've misread what the good book said 
 Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
 Give myself again 'til the well runs dry 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you it's a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what I'm talkin' bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Y'all feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what I'm talkin' bout? 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life, appetite 
 For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
 In a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
 Something's got me losing my mind 
 Where you at? From the front to the back 
 I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react 
 I thought I found you back in the ghetto 
 When I was 17 with the .38 Special 
 Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
 Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
 Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day 
 I could be your advocate 
 I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is 
 I could preach for you with the mighty tongue 
 I'm the one, how can I, overcome 
 Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?![Intro] 
 This, this, this 
 Should be played at high volume 
 Preferably in a residential 
  
 Life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch 
 But I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 My dick hard, her pussy wet 
  
 [Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar] 
 And I’m born with my dick in the earth 
 You can tell me how much am I worth 
 I’mma die with my heart on my sleeve 
 Many die on their hands and their knees 
 And I’m takin’ whatever I need 
 And I’m raping the government fees 
 And you’re wasting your time 
 And I’m speaking my mind on whatever I think 
 And I think that I’m Richard Pryor 
 With priors of 32 fiends 
 And that means that I hear for higher 
 Tell me why are you starin’ at me? 
 Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired 
 You inspired by Kendrick the king 
 Maybe it’s ’cause I’m living my dream 
 Man, I sing what I’m living about 
 And the words that come out of my mouth 
 They requires a random routine 
 Of being organic granite 
 Then my access is granted 
 To represent the shit that I conceive 
 And I guarantee that I’mma bring 
 My mind, body, soul 
 And I sold all these records off bein’ myself 
 And I wish you can do the same thing, man 
 It’s easier than a stripper 
 Or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along 
 And really why you writing a song? 
 Your passion for music is never in sync 
 No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen 
 And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit? 
 You'll get relief 
  
 I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 My dick hard, her pussy wet 
 I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
  
 (Hi, ho!) I came 
 (Bye, ho!) I went 
 (Hi, ho!) I came 
 (Bye, ho!) I went 
 (Hi, ho!) I came 
 (Bye, ho!) I went 
 (Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch) 
  
 [Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar] 
 And I see that you envy of me 
 Enemigos don’t prosper 
 Better yet, they do die eventually 
 If I’m at the event you will leave 
 ‘Cause you know and I know that 
 I go ham even if Muslims is seen 
 In my rearview I’m near you 
 But I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe? 
 With an oxygen mask, and 
 The masses keep saying I’m speaking for them 
 And if you can imagine my madness 
 Then you can see where I’ve been 
 And the places the Louis has been 
 And I swear I been doing this when 
 You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends 
 And you couldn’t harm me even with ten 
 Weapons of your choice riding in 
 Army tanks, you shot blanks 
 And I shot back, make your duplex bend 
 What the fuck you think? If I don’t think 
 Then I’m right back where the city sin 
 What the fuck you drink? 
 Thinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den 
 When I hear that you lyin’, then? 
 It’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope 
 You go downhill, man, where’s your slope? 
 Get thrown downhill tied to a rope 
 Tell the world to put intervals 
 Man, I swear this the anecdote 
 And they tell me that life is a bitch 
 Who gives a shit when you know? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 And I see that you envy of me 
 Don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually 
 Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen 
 In my rearview I’m near you 
 But I don't hear you, can you at least breathe? 
  
 (Hi, ho!) 
 (Bye, ho!)[Intro: Ab-Soul] 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Watch how I kill them with the funky rhythm 
 Embalming fluid fill 'em 
 Piranha's in 'em 
 Peep my persona as I 
 Get deep as Nostradamus 
 You stalling? Like the '89 I-I-Isiah Thomas 
 I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you sleepin' on me 
 I promise no peekin' homie you tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know 
 So, I switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention 
 One thing for sure, they gon' get it 
 I'm cursed with the world's negatives 
 Probably thinkin' I'm hurt but that's the only way I can live 
 More money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like Ace walking inside the club 
 Paid in Full, MOB license plates 
 38's slug hugging my waist like it had arms 
 Then I bear it so I guess it really does 
 No paper work on this marriage, but I'm in love with life corruptions rather than life (woah) 
  
 [Hook] 
 Oh, you ain't know? I need that 
 More money, more drugs I need that 
 More murder, more guns I need that, wondering how I live with the world's negatives 
  
 This the last days my nigga 
 We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga 
 So all I can say is get paid my nigga 
 Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most? 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Mamacita had a bangin' body 
 Drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably 
 He knew the nigga from high school 
 10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game 
 She knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that 
 Shorty wait, me and your man go way back 
 She said so what? He don't need to know what go on between us besides, I just wanna fuck 
 She blew his mind 
 Know what? we can exchange digits 
 Lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit 
 She seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate 
 Either she this polite or his lucky night 
 Got the champagne sittin' on ice 
 Room 112 fuckin' all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with 
 Got him for everything, pussy's a negative 
 Adam & Eve, he should've known 
  
 Oh you ain't know? you need that 
 More pussy, more hoes you need that 
 Even if it's dirty pussy you need that 
 Wondering how he lives with the world's negatives 
  
 This the last days my nigga 
 We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga 
 So all I can say is get paid my nigga 
 Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most? 
 We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so 
 Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh 
 This life will never change (rather than try to fix it) 
 So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living) 
 Seem's like we never see home, you know? 
 So we screaming 
 This life will never change (rather than try to fix it) 
 So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living) 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Goes out to everybody that know about bad habits 
 And willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction 
 Rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like Ke$ha's 
 Liver cirrhosis, matches givin' us cancer 
 Bitches givin' us gono-rrhea 
 I promise to practice safe sex, momma, don't cry 
 They say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time 
 So I crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head 
 Sippin' it slow hopin' it prolongs my soul 
 And that's crazy yo 
 When heat is on, I put on a coat 
 Then take it off when it's about to get cold 
 I've adapted to my environment, murder environment 
 20 years worth of it so I gotta love it, you can't blame me 
 Negative energy, public pulled by evil string 
 As I open a bible I start to sing 
  
 [Ab-Soul] 
 Liquor's invaded my kidneys 
 Got me ready to lick off momma forgive me 
 I can't be held accountable that negative's be gettin me down 
 Got me rolling with guys, making g's 
 Got me tellin' lies that sound true come test me 
  
 This the last days my nigga 
 We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga 
 So all I can say is get paid my nigga 
 Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most? 
 We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so 
 Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh 
 This life will never change (rather than try to fix it) 
 So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living) 
 Seem's like we never see home, you know? 
 So we screaming 
 This life will never change (rather than try to fix it) 
 So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)[Kendrick Lamar - singing] 
 A nigga so goddamn stressed out 
 I feel like fuck everything right now 
 See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life 
 But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout 
 See my pride is one thing I will not put aside 
 I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye 
 If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried 
 What? Uh 
  
 [Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you 
 Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Nobody, nobody but you 
 So it feels like, like it's only you 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to 
 I want to, I want to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
 I need to, I need to 
 I need to, I need to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar - singing] 
 It seems like, you can't win for losing 
 Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?" 
 Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come 
 Nobody knows the position that you in 
 But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing 
 That feeling, hard to explain 
 When you just, just want to get away 
 Something like 
  
 [Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you 
 Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Nobody, nobody but you 
 So it feels like, like it's only you 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to 
 I want to, I want to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
 I need to, I need to 
 I need to, I need to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
  
 [Schoolboy Q] 
 Away from it all 
 Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit 
 The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision 
 I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter 
 Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered 
 Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order 
 Instead of problem solving 
 From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride 
 Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes 
 Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud 
 Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread 
 As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony 
 Nothingness surrounding me, living my life 
 Though it's better to write 
 Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light 
 So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real 
 A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to 
 I want to, I want to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
 I need to, I need to 
 I need to, I need to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here[Intro] 
 Soundwave, I feel we, put together 
 Some of the most beautiful music my nigga 
 Real talk, feels so good 
 Let's get this money 
 I feel like rapping tonight people 
 Can I rap a little? 
 Don't be mad.. 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cuz I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low 
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look, why I always feel that I'm hot? 
 Why I always feel I should drop another jewel 
 Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed 
 With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all 
 I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it 
 I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked 
 I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go 
 But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on 
 I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up 
 Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck 
 Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah 
 It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars 
 Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick 
 Run for cover like winter's here then listen here 
 K. Dot you'll never shake me loose 
 Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too? 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low (I can't front) 
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward 
 I can't front, I can't front sometimes I feel like.. 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, why you always critiquing my shit 
 Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson 
 I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head 
 I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking 
 You could sell my words at an auction for the right price 
 And be rich your whole life, straight up 
 I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound 
 Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends 
 Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians 
 Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass 
 When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain? 
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a 
 Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business 
 You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics 
 Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low 
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck Ya!) 
 Check me out.. 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 What I write is a like a bomb device, press play 
 And you can die tonight 
 Shook ones don't exist whenever that K. Dot spit 
 Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike 
 I gets my ride on, you ride too 
 But like Scion, now that's a damn shame 
 I'm hogging up both lanes 
 Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart 
 They're so plain 
 I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus 
 Chocking with Punch 
 He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt 
 Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up 
 See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from 
 Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back 
 Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn 
 So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger 
 Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 Reporting live, from Compton, California 
 North Cackalack 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix 
 You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting 
 My itinerary is very hectic 
 I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless 
 Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist 
 Its arthritis from holding it down bitch 
 Me and my down bitch, get busy 
 I'm busy taking over, the world 
 With the weight of the world on my shoulder 
 My drive is not to be chauffeured 
 I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist 
 Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper 
 To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target 
 With offers that got me up in these offices often 
 Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying 
 Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times 
 The good kid from the mad city 
 Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock 
 In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops 
 Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride 
 Pop in my tape and roll the window, down 
 Like Stacie homie when airing out endo 
 I wish a nigga would 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock 
  
 [Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh] 
 Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite 
 All I ask, open your ears and please savor it 
 The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired 
 I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired 
 Now I'm brushing off the dust 
 We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust 
 Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk 
 People hear his pain, I consider that a plus 
 I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing 
 The Spike thing, consider me the in-between 
 The new regime taking over 
 Either we each other's opposition or you soldier 
 Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it 
 Off to the next, you unlucky bastard 
 I'm getting drunk same time every year 
 To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here 
 I swear 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo 
 Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines 
 When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet 
 I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet 
 I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the 
 City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers 
 Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter 
 Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 
  
 [Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh] 
 U-P-S, I deliver 
 Little brown boy get the pick of the litter 
 No glitter, all guts, no glory 
 Station on repeat, they retread the same story 
 New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit 
 Have a plate, that food for your soul tip 
 Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip- 
 Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

 [Hook] 
 I'm in the studio 
 All day all night 
 Cookin' up the flow 
 Gettin' my career right 
 As I should 
 Tryna get my mama up out the hood 
 So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke 
 Cause all my life I've been broke 
 I'm K-Dot if you didn't know 
 Aiming straight for the top 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hub City beat 
 87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police" 
 Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat 
 Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me 
 I move low-key, I think like a double OG 
 Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies 
 So high off life, that bitch I could OD 
 Die twice, and come back the same nigga 
 Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga 
 Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga 
 Me propane niggas for their dividends 
 Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons 
 West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her 
 'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires 
 Mmm, say hello to the new prince 
 I'm high king behind black tint 
 Na'mean?

 I'm in the studio

 [Verse 2: Lil Wayne] 
 Get the fuck out of my business 
 Because I've been handling the fuck out of my business 
 Grinding got perfect attendance 
 Flyer than first-class and detention 
 Uh, been a winner since the beginning 
 And my records show, not even in the Guinness 
 What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started 
 But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi 
 Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party 
 And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri 
 Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope? 
 Bright red flag like a red velvet rope 
 Open for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism 
 When this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less 
 Bitch, I be and I been ballin' 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm in the studio

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off 
 Send 'em off to the holy one 
 Put a hole in one, like miniature golf 
 Price on your head, and they trying to purchase 
 No matter the cost 
 Hand over the cloth 
 Cloth over the gun 
 Gun over your jaw 
 Bullet over your tongue 
 Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung 
 Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome 
 Over the snare drums 
 They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?" 
 I tell 'em none 
 Get it? I tell 'em none 
 Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums 
 In the back of my True Religions 
 Never passed the bar but 
 I ain't got to study law 
 Just to judge lyrics 
 Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics 
 Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence

 [Intro : Ab-Soul] 
 Yeah, see I know I can make a lot of money doing this man 
 It's just the whole process that uh... 
 That I'm having trouble with know what I mean 
 I know you just pretty much, you know 
 Get the water boiling and just uh get a jar or something like that 
 Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Shame on him! (what?) 
 Lemme put my gloves on 
 And my scrubs on 
 I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen 
 This here is not for the children 
 You need parental advision 
 If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business 
 First you bargain shop 
 Look for the priciest chickens 
 I recommend that you pay 
 Jorge a visit 
 Got it wrapped in saran 
 17.5 no 
 Drop four grand 
 This is LA man 
 Unless it be a drought 
 But homie if it ain't 
 Then it is somewhere else 
 Flip your hustle down south 
 That's a whole other story though 
 Back to the lesson 
 Hope you're takin' down your footnotes 
 Class is in session 
 Get your instruments 
 Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker 
 And a hanger you can stir it with 
 Split nine Os four ways in that 36 
 Place it on the triple beam 
 As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky 
 Say you'll get it baby just bear with me 
 Confidence before compliments 
 Now let's get busy 
 This is the procedure 
 250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda 
 Place it in the beaker 
 Your water should be boiling by then 
 Grab a small cup and pour it in 
 Twist the hanger until it's paper thin 
 Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin 
 But hold on it gets tricky again! 
 As your hand rotate 
 You're probably thinkin' it's safe 
 Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace 
 The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache 
 You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith 
 Wait...you got it back soft (good) 
 Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar 
 The work should rise to the top 
 Then pour some cold water on that 
 That's when the dope should drop 
 Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet 
 Place it on the cardboard, then chop 
 As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy 
 You're excited that the chemistry worked 
 This the fiend's appetite 
 This bigger than life 
 You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night 
 You should thank me twice 
 Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life 
 How ironic...hmm 
 Like most of you rappers 
  
 [Outro: Ab Soul] 
 Aw I don't believe that man 
 You're too professional with it man 
 There's no way you've never done it before, know what I mean 
 That was too descriptive[Produced by Cool and Dre] 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein 
 I'm prime time like Deion 
 And the rest of y'all is peons 
 I pee on the best 
 Whoever you are you can step 
 Like a prosthetic leg 
 I see monsters in my head 
 That's why I rap with such aggression 
 I tear down studio sessions 
 Rappers scared, they walk in the booth 
 With a bible and a reverend 
 I use my mouth as a weapon 
 Bullets rip through your mid section 
 Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat 
 I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket 
 Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage 
 Because I've got to eat 
 And for real I'm feeling kind of famished 
 Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is 
 Show me where your fans is so they can see the real 
 I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill 
 Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend 
 But I'm not an actor, put that in my will 
 Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing 
 She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin 
 Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot 
 Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks 
 Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks 
 Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn 
 I'm not concerned about the SoundScan 
 Cause most of y'all is drowning 
 A lifeguard that's lounging 
 Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers 
 I'm way more live 
 That's evil backwards 
 Now with that great word play 
 I tend to let my words play 
 Like children on a Saturday 
 It's sad to say you're not up to par 
 And I don't play with mini golf and sharks 
 Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms 
 Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy 
 And make sure you wear a vest 
 Because they my family ties 
 Suit up 
 You got a three piece? I got a three piece 
 A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE 
 He backpedaling like a DB 
 I'm such a Martian 
 Call me ET 
 Always behind it like I own the TP 
 I shit, fart, pee pee 
 On anybody track 
 Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax 
 Wassup 
 Now phone home 
 My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch] 
 Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist 
 I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage 
 Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick 
 20 on the charm 
 VVS studded flawless 
 Try and reach we specialize in garbage 
 Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits 
 How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond 
 I wail on niggas I'm vicious 
 No, I'm serious 
 Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean 
 You niggas ain't listening 
 I'm not from 'round these parts 
 I'm nonexistent 
 Hit you with brake light 
 Leave you missing[Intro] 
 Ali, mix it 
 Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup? 
 Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup? 
 Ha ha ha, ha... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I spaz out 'til I pass out 
 There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth 
 Your parody’s not funny 
 Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies 
 As long as the lord love me, I’m good 
 I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood 
 I should: stick a fork in this music business 
 But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis 
 Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at? 
 I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that 
 Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein 
 And rhyming like Rakim in ’89 
 Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom 
 Like a man 99 years old locked in prison 
 Don’t freeload on my vision 
 Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden 
 I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it 
 Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage 
 My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip 
 And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock 
 I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun 
 And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch 
 Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got 
 Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props 
 Hear the difference? I’m cool like that 
 Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back 
 See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja 
 Who can bust like a charter, why bother? 
 I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life 
 But still I carry on like luggage on a flight 
 The realness in my bones is the DNA to life 
 I can give you insight only if you’re in sight 
 I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike! 
 And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes! 
 I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable 
 You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights 
 Cloud 9, where you can find 
 Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime 
 Wait 'til I’m in my prime 
 The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion 
 To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm 
 I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs 
 It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that 
 I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back 
 Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success 
 Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck 
 I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death 
 Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft 
 I will: conquer my biggest dreams 
 Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings 
 Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred 
 And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head 
 But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal 
 Humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo 
 Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park 
 Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go 
 I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise 
 For no faulty ass A&R or CEO 
 We ain't what you think and you think we’re back 
 But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that 
 Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat 
 Get your other eye cracked 
 I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war 
 I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour 
 I came up lower middle class, not poor 
 So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me 
 I need y’all to feel me 
 And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free 
 My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived 
 By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide[Lady Gaga] 
 I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me 
 Things I don’t understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I’m yelling 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich 
 Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist 
 I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life 
 I always knew life can be dangerous 
 I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless 
 You don’t know what pain is 
 How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you 
 Fell on my face and I woke with a scar 
 Another mistake living deep in my heart 
 Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick 
 I can admit that it did look like yours 
 Why you resent every making of this 
 Tell me your purpose is petty again 
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
  
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me then put me on stages 
 To me that’s amazing 
 To you that’s a quick check with all disrespect let me say this 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love 
 You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does 
 And I'm looking right past you 
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles 
 You live in a world, you living behind the mirror 
 I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 This shit is vital, I know you had to 
 To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain 
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain 
 Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame 
 On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box 
 I'mma break out and then hide every lock 
 I'mma break out and then hide every lock 
  
 [Bridge] + [Hook] 
  
 [Lady Gaga] 
 I am a human who’s probably gonna fault again 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me 
 Things I don’t understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it but today I’m yelling 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe 
 Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibeReminder that you can click the images for more annotations. 
  
 Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton. 
  
  
 We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone. 
  
 It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds. 
  
 So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed." 
  
 It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast. 
  
 It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street: 
 If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector. 
  
 "Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar. 
  
 Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call." 
  
 It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned. 
  
 A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy." 
  
  
 On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!" 
  
 I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't." 
  
 A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes. 
  
 I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers." 
  
  
 When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds. 
  
 "I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette." 
  
 The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle." 
  
 Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman." 
  
 A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club." 
  
 Kendrick spoke up. 
  
 "We have to go." 
  
 "Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go." 
  
 "You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!" 
  
 Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said. 
  
 "Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand." 
 The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet. 
  
 After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas." 
  
 By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party. 
  
 It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be." 
  
 At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.[Verse 1] 
 These streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic 
 Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb 
 Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip 
 It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent 
 This is Jesus of Nazareth 
 Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown 
 In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds 
 Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed 
 Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick 
 Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower 
 I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder 
 No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental 
 Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein 
 I'm kurupted! 
  
 I'm kurupted! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees 
 Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless 
 Catch you, hang you from many nooses 
 Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless 
 Young and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops 
 Lazer-in on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten 
 Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god 
 Count your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin 
 Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do 
 Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck 
 I'm kurupted! 
  
 I'm kurupted! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 (Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it 
 At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!) 
 Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance 
 Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit 
 Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT 
 Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P 
 Complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter 
 House is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya' 
 Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh, laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos 
 Three six-fo's, One bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot 
 I'm Kurupted! 
  
 [Outro] 
 See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends 
 West Coast legends, Young Gotti 
  
 I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted[Produced by Play-N-Skillz]

 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, and when I wake up 
 I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
 But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down 
 What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life 
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
 Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight 
 Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows 
 20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me 
 Everything I sow, so my karma come 
 And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record 
 Tell the world I know it's too late 
 Boys and girls, I think I gone cray 
 Drown inside my vices all day 
 Won't you please believe when I say? 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, been down before 
 Hitta, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"

 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho' 
 Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door 
 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow 
 But we gon' be alright

 [Verse 2] 
 What you want, you a house, you a car? 
 A piano, a guitar? 
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
 Look, you can live at the mall 
 I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal 
 I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero 
 Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal 
 Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you 
 Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
 In the presence of your chico... ah! 
 I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel 
 If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you 
 Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all 
 Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all 
 I rap, I black on track so rest assured 
 I right my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Get back 
 Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom 
 Mixin' Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem 
 I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla (Alright) 
 No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta 
 Keep the decency and make them TNT my product 
 I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer 
 Inner-city bullet fly 'til that thing on auto pilot (Alright) 
 I don't really care about the care abouts 
 All I care about is wearing out your upper body 
 When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house 
 (Alright) 
 Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy 
 Big K's and my big dogs 
 Never, ever, went straight home, boy 
 (Alright)[Verse 1] 
 His eyes bloodshot red 
 I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother 
 Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other 
 He was hurting, I can see it, plenty tears, no kleenex 
 I stood by his side because that was my homie 
 Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me 
 Clinching his fist on some angry shit 
 Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with 
 I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer 
 But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war 
 Revenge, what do you say to a good friend 
 That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet 
 I tried my best to make him renig 
 But he was like, my nig this feeling is more than personal 
 I stood down 
 He hopped in a four door, Honda Accord before he 
 Bent the block, he said K Dot 
  
 [Hook] 
 "(You wouldn't understand) 
 These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes 
 Not by choice, but forced to be a menace 
 Can someone just pray for me, or war 
 (Or at least, try to understand) the city pressure 
 The AK-47, twin MAC-11s 
 The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons 
 Pray for me, or war" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Corners become monuments for the dead 
 Candles on the pavement, postcard read 
 Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets 
 A baby mama yellin at the police 
 But you don't understand 
 You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold 
 Y' see this wasn't in our plans 
 Babies from the late 80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way 
 Put that Malcom X book down then raise that K 
 Complete chaos when we off x pills and St. Ides 
 Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye 
 Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee 
 Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind 
 Substance, time, is no longer an issue 
 We don't have it, so pass the tissue 
 Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can 
 And tell her you understand, but you don't understand 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 He came back fifteen minutes later 
 He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor 
 Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you 
 This as critical as it gets, my nigga I need you" 
 I said alright, so what happened? "Seen a few niggas slippin 
 And I just started clappin, I didn't care who I was hittin" 
 That's wild shit, but anyway I got you 
 I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow 
 I woke up the next mornin' with a cold 
 Allergies got me sneezin and wipin' my nose when it was leaking 
 Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin for some Dayquil 
 But all I seen was some Asprin, just my luck 
 I got up, went to Rite Aid 
 Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid - I bought it and left 
 Walked to the parking lot, when I see the faces of death 
 Said they was lookin for my man with a chopper in they hand 
 Prayin it would jam, but you don't understand 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Its like a revolving door that i've been a part of my whole life. fucked up right?Real rap, I knock rhymes right off of your skull cap 
 You can't see me when I step into the booth 
 Your wish list, K.Dot, yeah I'm the truth 
 Stuntin, you'd better get your broom 
 Cause I'm flying with witches and we're going to the moon 
 With this album, debut at that 
 I'm so fly I might float with the bats 
 Y'all know the most 
 Biggie and Pac, they behind me as my ghosts 
 Cause you think they write for me when I step into the drop 
 My shit is so sweet, candy flavored, no you're not 
 Skeletons in my closet 
 And no, you can't get up off it 
 This the freestyle, trick or treat 
 Halloween, better come with me, I'm sweet 
 Pumpkins, smacking them across they head 
 And I'm pokin' eyeballs out on the web instead 
 He gonna gonna keep going 
 Baby, sex tape killed me 
 Ye, ye, I'm so fly, right now I'm so high 
 Matter of fact oh we talking about the hurricane 
 I'm talking about New York, I pray for y'all, know what I mean 
 I don't want that to happen, cuz if so I might just start rapping 
 Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass in 
 [Laughter] 
 Coming straight from Compton, I thought y'all know 
 I ain't gonna look at the cards yet, cause I'm 'bout to flow 
 Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers 
 Everybody that's disrespecting, y'all the fakers 
 We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome 
 Mavs, y'all gonna go home 
 Teach y'all to come back to my city 
 Shrink you, G 
 Five times, four times, that's the repeat 
 Obama, we ain't gonna talk about Ritt Momney 
 Because he's whack, fugazi, fugazi 
 I don't need to talk about the flow that I'm in 
 If you gonna vote, vote for Obama 
 He's gonna win, fo sho 
 And we gonna keep on going 
 Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing 
 We gonna get back to this little punk, he's crap 
 Mitt Romney, show 'em how to rap 
 Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him 
 You're homeboys right now with Slim 
 Your chances, you're not gonna win 
 You need to go back to where you came from, boy 
 It's the ruler of the game 
 Obama, vote now homeboy, he's got change 
 What's up[Intro: Michael Jackson, Busta Rhymes] 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Yeah, I know 
 It's been a minute 
 Got to know 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Yeah, you need me (woooh!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy 
 How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me 
 Big marbles, nigga 
 I lead this new generation, boy 
 Don't argue with us 
 Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters 
 And it's all for the literature 
 And it's all for the hideous 
 The nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh 
 I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop) 
 I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah 
 My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes 
 I write for sure, my folks unite 
 Soon as the flow get nice 
 The poltergeist that scare emcees 
 My prototype for every 
 My share of these and R.I.P 
 She know my type of style is like my everything 
 Apparently, my appetite stay famished 
 Bite no hand that feed 
 The culture vulture die and bleed 
 My focus hold these thoughts and dreams 
 Control this pen (Look over your shoulder) 
 Boldest lines in rhymes and things 
 Devote my time and mind it seems 
 Supposed to shine, remind I'm king 
 Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends 
 The pro's the con's, the diamond rings 
 The forward time, but I'ma bring 
 The soul divine and cross between 
 What's your's and mine's, the gold, the green 
 The roads that show just what it mean 
 That grabbed Shakur and by the wing 
 And fly before my vocal scream! 
 For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc bag full of goodies 
 You Chris Rock 
 Hit the pookie and pit stops 
 Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug 
 Just look over your shoulders 
 When they fuck you over 
 It's love, I know ya 
  
 [Chorus: Michael Jackson] 
 (Wooh!) 
 Don't you know, baby? 
 Don't you know, baby? 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Busta Rhymes] 
 Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me? 
 'Cause I done bodied the game to the point 
 Niggas scared to rap with me 
 Get burned until they anointed me 
 One of the kings of black history 
 And yes, I see the game is a little different 
 Niggas lack simply 
 And bars and I spit 'em like darts 
 'Til they puncture your kidney 
 You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me 
 And you gon' make my gun cock until your hole night away 
 Yeah, ohh 
 I'm the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believerer maker 
 So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em 
 So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em 
 While 'em crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em 
 When I arrive, my theme music, gotta pound to it 
 And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it 
 'Cause I'm the god, the harder, the martyr, the father 
 I spit the saliva, that's leaking the lava 
 Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin' 
 And beating you niggas completed-ly 
 Conquer, extremely bark on a nigga 
 You see me, you deeply carve up a nigga, believe me 
 Graffiti your arm up, you heebee, you jeebee 
 But, Kenny, you brought up (You give me pity) 
 Now give me the startup 
 You treat me, you greet me, you meet me with arms up 
 So sweet when I spit 
 Heaven's deep, it was deep 
 I was sleep, now the guard's up, hmm 
 Upholding the fundamentals 
 While most of you boast the rental 
 Focus on what's most essential 
 Spit bars to provoke your mental 
 Do I have your attendamiento? 
 While I clap these raps like thunders 
 Look over your shoulder boy and wonder 
  
 [Chorus: Michael Jackson] 
 (Wooh!) 
 Don't you know, baby? (ooh, woah) 
 Don't you know, baby? (mhm, mhn, yeah) 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Whenever you need me (when you need me) 
 Just look over your shoulders! 
 Whenever you need me (whenever you need me) 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!) 
  
 [Verse 3: SZA] 
 With god watchin' over us 
 And me over your shoulders 
 (All you had to do is look forward) 
 But what you gonna do? 
 You pull the devil even closer 
 (Why'd you pull the devil even closer?) 
 Them clowns that you hang with 
 More ridiculous than white Cleopatra 
 Or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa 
 But I digress, you're more, but you act less 
 Why do you act less? 
 Even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder 
 (Just look over your shoulders) 
 I'm here whenever you need me 
 When you need me 
 Whenever you need me 
 When you need me 
  
 [Chorus: Michael Jackson, SZA] 
 (Wooh!) 
 Don't you know, baby? 
 Don't you know, baby? 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over shoulders, honey! 
 Yeah yeah, you need me (Wooh!) 
 (Wooh!) 
 Don't you know baby? 
 Don't you know baby? 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders! 
 Whenever you need me 
 Just look over your shoulders, honey![Intro] 
 And this is for the homies 
 I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie 
 Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee 
 Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we... 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown 
 I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham 
 Looking for E.T. to phone home 
 Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days 
 Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains 
 Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons 
 Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion 
 That's fashion if you come where I'm from 
 Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun 
 Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me 
 But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip 
 Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack 
 He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that 
 And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good 
 Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies 
 Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers 
 Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us 
  
 [Hook] 
 And this is for the homies 
 I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie 
 Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee 
 Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on 
 And if you feel good (hey) 
 Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey) 
 Represent the city like you know you should (hey) 
 I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on 
 (Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on 
 (Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on 
 (Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on 
 (Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 As I continue my day, quite copacetic 
 Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell 
 Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas 
 ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past 
 We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em 
 Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom 
 Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites 
 I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions 
 But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima 
 Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good 
 The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos 
 Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty 
 I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to 
 Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say? 
 Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G 
 If you can't relate then please have a seat 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known 
 And put on for the soil of which you was grown 
 I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors 
 While giving you cuts like fresh tapers 
 I'm such a fool with it, go nuts 
 You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck 
 The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck 
 Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us 
 This ain't for you, so what?! 
  
 [Hook]Bitch, yeah, ha 
  
 Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead 
 Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head 
 All blue, all red, smothers every corner 
 Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia 
 Good 'ol California, killa' California 
 Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless 
 Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming 
 Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs 
 I'm in the booth zoning 
 Like 28 grams, of the good yams 
 Fiends line up in the morning 
 I'm cloning, greatness 
 My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan 
 I could burn through some braces 
 If I had 'em 
 This is the return of the dragon 
 I'm not talking about, bruce lee 
 I'm talking about, true heat 
 And it look like you got cold feet 
 Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name 
  
 (laughing) 
  
 Point blank range, as I take aim, at success 
 Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest 
 I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor 
 I rip through that like I rip through a rapper 
 I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor 
 Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform 
 Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall 
 Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl 
 But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare 
 Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air 
 Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's 
 No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right 
 Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message 
 Before your T-Mobile lose service 
 And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous 
 Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you 
 Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch 
 Don't fuck with me 
  
 I'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like 
 Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag 
 And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols 
 Students please get out your pencils 
 I'm about to break down the principles of the game 
 Don't complain because, it could be much worse 
 Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse 
 Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars 
 You playing with that you playing with fire 
  
 Burn (echoes) 
  
 Straight from the belly of the beast 
 Break it to the police 
 Said he put it on me 
 I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G 
 Ride with the P, 89 creep 
 On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone 
 Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy 
 A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair 
 We playin for keeps, no food no sleep 
 I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him 
 Put him under the streets, and I guarantee 
 I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps 
 His alarm clock beep, I be right there 
 Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife 
 Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice 
 Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there 
 Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here 
 We ain't runnin' 
 We be gunnin' 
 Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin' 
 Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion 
 Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon 
 Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog 
 I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall 
 Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes 
 Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes 
 I'm a gorilla in every state 
 Your opinion don't mean shit mind yo business 
 Before I give your mind a business 
 Ask matadors I ain't bullshittin' 
 Bitches 
  
 Bleh bleh[Verse 1] 
 You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this 
 Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this 
 Snatch your, uh, in a club like this 
 Seven zeros, need my pub like this 
 Stuck in a rock in a hard place 
 I am thinkin' I won't bump y'all up, well, I am 
 I got to get my thing off 
 My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2 
 And James Brown with his fist crossed 
 I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers 
 Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton? 
 Multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow 
 If Dre ain't motivation, I don't know who is 
 Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big 
 Or maybe I'm too pessimistic to know I'm gifted 
 Chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin' 
 I dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em 
 Grab my dick and pour on 'em 
 Yeah, homie, I'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop 
 Hoppin' out on my enemies, I know who to shoot 
 Back when my homies where I need to be 
 Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke 
 I watched a homie watch his son smoke 
 I seen the sun set on my set 
 I seen one 'Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close 
 Everythin' subject to change 
 Nowadays, the Compton Crip car kill each other 
 Faster than an opposite color 
 Homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie 
 It's your mother, your uncle and brother 
 If God was a Loc, he'd probably had one comin' 
 Damn, that's fucked up, I guess it is 
 When you can't trust not a soul inside these streets 
 I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see 
 To let 'em know it's more than just Pamela Lee 
 They said, "Good looking" 
 Paused the video the moment his phone ring 
 That fast dollar was his only problem 
 No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower 
 The block was home and Africa was too far for power 
 Then I knew 
  
 [Bridge] 
 And you don't and you don't and you don't 
 And you don't and you don't and you don't 
 And you don't and you don't and you don't 
 And you don't and you don't stop 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This feelin' is unmatched 
 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap 
 We don't share the same synonyms, fall back 
 Been in it before Internet had new hacks 
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visitin' freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision 
 Kendrick is master and mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction, runnin' pure magic 
 Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque 
 But what's better than that? I know everything 
 I know everything, I know myself 
 I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
 I know fatality might haunt you 
 I know everything, I know Compton 
 I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything 
 I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors 
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
 I know everything, I know history 
 I know the universe works mentally 
 I know the perks of bullshit, that isn't meant for me 
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money 
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's hungry 
 I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies 
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 You know, they know that from Compton School District 
 I give it to the kids, don’t gossip ‘bout how it was distributed 
 I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life 
 I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well 
 Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit 
 Big Boy, what’s up? 
  
 [Bridge] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I don’t give a butt  about no politics in rap 
 My little homie Stunna Deuce ain’t never comin' back 
 So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax 
 Bump what they talking ‘bout, this here is where it’s at 
 Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game 
 I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game 
 Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
 I’m stickin' to the scripts like, “Yeah, 'em Benjamins can cuddle up” 
 I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks 
 It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this 
 That’s what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix 
 Fifty-homie salute, I’m out to Compton Zoo with the extras 
 El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
 Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans that eff with me 
 Nobody can eff with me, tell y'all to eff with me 
 Jumpin' out the Caddy, uh, just got my dick sucked 
 The little homies called 
 They said, "The enemies done cliqued up" 
 Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
 Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
 Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
 Homie’s name on paper, you snitched all summer 
 The streets don’t fail me now, they want to put the game in town 
 From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around 
 Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
 Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’? 
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
 Tell me they profit to fuck with you 
 Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, "What it do?" 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Can I get one more? 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
 Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black 
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’ 
 Motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum 
 Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
 Don’t ask about no politician at award shows 
 No, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes 
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
 I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
 Had the Coast on standby 
 “K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
 I box ‘em all in, buyin' land stock[Intro] 
 "Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3 
 Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes 
 And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet 
 At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features 
 Relax and breathe normally" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh, coming down like I'm uphill 
 Hogging both lanes better than a bus will 
 She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel 
 But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still 
 I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather 
 Then step out like Chicago in its finest era 
 You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra 
 Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort 
 Ha-ha, I let the world know 
 I chose to keep to myself and let the world go 
 And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know 
 So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up 
 I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one 
 Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston 
 Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come 
 Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson 
  
 [Hook] 
 And I'm a trip 
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip 
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip 
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this 
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down 
 Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now 
 I got enough of the mojo to go around 
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town 
 Cause I'm a trip 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Landing on another runway, fly with me 
 Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee 
 Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on 
 Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron 
 I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business 
 Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches 
 Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes 
 Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those 
 And she know what this is, hey lil' mama 
 Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama 
 But why you always in somebody face lil' mama? 
 Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama) 
 Nigga, I gotta be that nigga 
 If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga 
 Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage 
 Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that 
 That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack 
 Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks 
 So I can live on a hill just off a few raps 
 I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit 
 That might be outer space, the Jupiter district 
 I quadruple my vision 
 If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open 
 I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking 
 On some Compton shit 
 Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch 
 You see my city is the city of Lamar 
 It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all 
 The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping 
 The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan 
 I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming 
 So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 "How was your flight Mr. Lamar? 
 Good, hope to see you next time"[Intro] 
 Baby you understand me now 
 If sometimes you see that I'm mad 
 Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel 
 When everything goes wrong, you see some bad 
 But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 As soon as the beat drop 
 Within two bars, you already said I'm hot 
 They savor, my fruits of labor 
 My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots 
 God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo 
 To go against me you gotta be more than professional 
 You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection 
 And I be fucking all these bars 
 We be sexing I'm a nympho 
 For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it 
 Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap 
 Take this and take that from the machine 
 Got this money up, with no caffeine 
 Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening 
 You looking at me then your sight seeing 
 And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate 
 I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul 
 Tech! Leave 'em by the benches 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I see the future better than your computers 
 Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger 
 Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders 
 Leave them dead inside the sewers 
 Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer 
 Burning up the very sun, the rapture 
 The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster 
 I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield 
 The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on 
 Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb 
 Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect 
 If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check 
 Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying 
 King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel 
 Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock] 
 My flow cold, like Aspen 
 I love to show off when I'm in that Aston 
 Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack 
 A east side nigga I can get you popped at 
 A hundred rounds nigga stop that 
 You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back 
 I'm too gutta nigga top that 
 This is lyrical homicide, not rap 
 So don't get it misunderstood 
 Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood 
 With 45 goons 45 shugs 
 Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof 
 I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof 
 Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss 
 I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life 
 Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night 
 I just might... 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 ...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite 
 For the top dog catalog, that means everybody 
 Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers 
 Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that 
 If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap 
 I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real 
 Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will 
 Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill 
 Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till 
 Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head 
 Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos 
 My arms froze, popsicle 
 Observing the game, I'm so official[Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
 I can't be stopped 
 It's payday and I'm in the candy drop 
 So for real, Candy Rain flooding your spot 
 Firestone tires hot, burning the block 
 For pete's sake I'm a heatwave melting your dot 
 My ship sail, so I should move units and quick 
 The whip trail like a mixed, variation of chips 
 So when I dip, it's kinda ironic 
 And all I do is hotbox Hydro, call it a carpool 
 I'm from the west, where the Tec's is drawn like Cartoon Network 
 Wetshirt, a marksman will become my ex expert 
 Welcome to school fools, don't get an F for effort 
 Top Dawg money gang, winter fresh, sunny chain 
 Bad bitches 
 Angry paper, got mad riches 
 Who the fuck you think you're up against? Come again? 
 Shades darker than the bitch, but I see you niggas 
 And I, see you niggas, wouldn't wanna be you niggas 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Welcome to the C4 
 I got the bombs and the rental 
 Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans 
 Goddamn, I'm the man, for life 
 The left coast, bitch get it right 
 Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 It's Top Dawg 
 They call me Rock, boy 
 Shit I came a long way from selling rocks, boy 
 'Bout my cash money, you can call me hot boy 
 I throw shots, guns clap, like an encore 
 B's up, hoes down, that's right blood 
 Can't be street sweepers, get your ass mopped up 
 Damn, I'm in a 2008 something 
 Sitting on chrome buttons, nigga no bluffing 
 Hit a club, all eyes on my neck 
 Got $20,000 worth of diamonds on my chest, nigga 
 Fuck VIP, I'm on the floor chunking up my sets 
 Twisting fingers with my niggas, blowing swishers, sipping liquor, 'till I'm pissy, fucking bitches, it's so easy 
 Get the name, tell them the telly nothing but pipe in their belly 
 .380 keep it on my waist like a celly 
 K.Dot 'bout to bomb on you niggas, get ready motherfucker 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q] 
 I keep a big loaf of the toast, be careful when the toaster pop (Q) 
 Hashbrowns and all, shooting out tater tots 
 Around 8 o'clock I let it go for 8 a pop 
 Taking off wigs like I'm working at a beauty shop 
 I'm getting money, most success what I'm achieving 
 Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething 
 Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips 
 Green hash in the back, something to make my heart skip (damn) 
 You ain't seen a dresser that's fresher and keep it ghetto 
 Had a gat utter, sing to you; Reuben Studdard 
 See my team rougher, y'all fat; cream puffer 
 Your broad serve the whole squad, call her clique fucker 
 Start to thinking that I'm the best, just sort of speaking 
 More than decent, and fucking something that's Puerto Rican 
 I'm cool as ever, not concerned about the weather 
 Getting every dollar, I'm steady stacking my cheddar 
 Hard as ever, y'all cats soft as a feather 
 Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never 
 Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg I'm no pussy 
 Got big cajones, my nigga you can't douche me 
 Look, hard as a rock, look, yo I'm hard to smash 
 New in-dash, bump loud, speakers blast 
 Heard a couple of your songs, your whole shit was trash 
 Fucking over the game, your whole squad is ass 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 4: BO] 
 Yeah, I tell 'em, I tell 'em, bang, bow, pop the man shit 
 As a young whippersnapper, been toting guns in my pants 
 Niggas bitches, niggas snitching, yeah they taking the stand 
 Cause a nigga on the block moves a couple of grand 
 Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s 
 Shit, BO never stopping, cause the flow is a headache, and my swag is a Oxycotin 
 It's Top Dawg money gang, 20 grand verte chain 
 Bentley GT, 3 pieces, nigga fuck a raise 
 Hustle like I'm broke man, advise you to do the same 
 Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man 
 Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft 
 They pull up to new coupe, watch me fucking knock their top off 
 Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants 
 Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light 
 Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night 
 Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Moving through the block like a centipede 
 No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze 
 I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist 
 Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped 
 I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White 
 I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics 
 The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis 
 As I perform like Santa Clause 
 Pause TVs in the Phantom 
 Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them 
 Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke 
 Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse 
 They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai 
 Anything else is uncivilized 
 Fucker[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper 
 A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em 
 "Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him 
 Hoping that he's listening 
 Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years 
 What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies 
 I can taste the salt from my tears 
 As the water had start to flood on my eyes 
 I know it gotta be hard being 21 
 Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old 
 Your brother's getting older 
 And the streets is getting colder 
 And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road 
 Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks 
 Ain't recieved any mail 
 It's cold and the hole stinks 
 And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life 
 As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine 
 Jason Keaton, I can only imagine 
  
 [Chorus: Javonte] 
 Life's about decisions man 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
 Just take control if you can 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby 
 After he just got out, 15 years to count 
 Haven't seen the world in so long 
 Haven't seen a girl in so long 
 And before the sun came up, he was gone 
 Like a fiend off the best rock 
 Trying to get his life together, or what not 
 Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity 
 Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity 
 Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce 
 Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick 
 Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see 
 Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment 
 Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic 
 Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes 
 Only out a year, now facing life 
 I can only imagine 
 That's fucked up 
 I can only imagine, Uncle Bob 
  
 [Chorus: Javonte] 
 Life's about decisions man 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
 Just take control if you can 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio 
 Of blacks in prison as compact in prison 
 When blacks pack with minorities 
 System grab more of these 18 year olds 
 18 year sentence with no parole 
 The state won't oversee 
 They make the term severe, a conspiracy? 
 That's what I call it, it's full of shit 
 A toilet can help quick, the government help? 
 No, just put us on death row 
 Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke 
 Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope 
 Then hang it like right there, yeah 
 It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair 
 Care? No 
 Alcatraz was purchased by a white man 
 For 5 grand, with intentions to expand 
 More prisons 
 So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation 
 They for grossing a bigger business 
 Imagine 
 We're being used 
 Imagine 
 The truth shall be told 
  
 [Chorus: Javonte] 
 Life's about decisions man 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
 Just take control if you can 
 It's in your hand and you got it[Intro] 
 Greetings people 
 You're now rockin' with the best 
 Hub City's threat 
 Minor of the year 
 K.Dot 
 I know the hood's been waitin', right 
 I'mma stop being stingy 
 I'mma share with y'all 
  
 [Verse] 
 Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant 
 Make street disciples go and get a membership 
 Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip 
 This is church 
 Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst 
 Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly 
 I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse 
 Add 10% more and what to you get 
 A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent 
 I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots 
 Mind militant, nigga don't try it 
 Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence 
 Y'all don't rap 
 Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens 
 So I'm here to shut shit down 
 The four pound decorate your city 
 Make over your town 
 I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy 
 'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now 
 Where no man has stepped, no man has repped 
 No man can withstand all the nights I've slept 
 Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death 
 Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath 
 I'll take you to them pearly gates 
 Them golden streets 
 Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep 
 The Hub City shit is me 
  
 [Outro] 
 Do you believe 
 It's Kendrick the God[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock] 
 My people don't love me 
 Why we hate each other? 
 Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers? 
 My people don't love me 
 We can love one another 
 We should stick together because we're all we got 
 My people don't love me 
 Why we ride on another, need to love one another 
 We all we got 
 My people don't love me 
 I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got 
 My people don't love me 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Rock] 
 This whole world's spillin' senseless killing 
 Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve 
 Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow 
 Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters 
 A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong 
 Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone 
 Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered 
 That was so impatient, take him from the next man 
 Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can 
 Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan 
 To get residuals, kill for dividends 
 This life is critical, we living in a time where 
 9-year olds tote 9's 
 Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines 
 I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My people don't love me 
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate? 
 My people don't love me 
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK 
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake 
 But every time I turn around you take it from me 
 Black people don't love me 
 Hate each other we do each other wrong 
 That's why today, black people let's love we 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Can't be a positive black role model 
 Leading the future with no haters to follow 
 Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see 
 Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what? 
 He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down 
 He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him 
 You burn your brother's bridges 
 His accomplishments making way for your children 
 Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride 
 No never been, never win, gotta lose 
 That's the slope that's for the black heritage 
 We play the fool better than comedians 
 Disobediant dude no respect, ethics 
 I refuse to be a statistic 
 But changing my community don't seem realistic 
 Show me an African American doing right 
 I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My people don't love me 
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate? 
 My people don't love me 
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK 
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake 
 But every time I turn around you take it from me 
 Black people don't love me 
 Hate each other we do each other wrong 
 That's why today, black people let's love we 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock] 
 We stuck together back in slavery days 
 Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way 
 The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves 
 The shit need to stop today 
 Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us 
 To become better people, think about it 
 We used to run from the KKK 
 But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's 
 Man, never thought there'd be days like this 
 Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with 
 Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain 
 When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing 
 United we stand tall, divided we all fall 
 Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all 
 On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop 
 Black people we all we got 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My people don't love me 
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate? 
 My people don't love me 
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK 
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake 
 But every time I turn around you take it from me 
 Black people don't love me 
 Hate each other we do each other wrong 
 That's why today, black people let's love we 
  
 [Outro: Jay Rock] 
 Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee 
 We all we got man 
 It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop 
 Real talk 
 Black people need to smarten up 
 We all we got[Verse 1] 
 When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short 
 And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out 
 Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice 
 Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost 
 For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey 
 Caught a bullet that probably destroyed... 
 A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed 
 I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan 
 Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing 
 Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason... 
 Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood 
 That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin 
 But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy 
 Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy 
 Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang 
 But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood 
 And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade 
 Good Kid 
 M.A.A.D City 
 Life or death 
 Is you with me? 
 Wassup[Verse 1: K. Dot] 
 I sit on the studio couch 
 Ask myself what the fuck am I thinking about 
 Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present 
 A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off 600 seconds 
 10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore 
 K. Dot had turned Curious George 
 You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for 
 Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads 
 Before he turned right to get them shots through the door 
 They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic 
 So he'd risk his own life, to get someone else killed 
 But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense 
 It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying the solve the crime of these rap souls 
 What if B.I.G. never did it big 
 Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes 
 Would it make my flow flow more persistent 
 Would it raise up the bar of competition, who knows 
 Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV 
 Would the battle be less interesting, if it wasn't personal 
 If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening 
 People thinking its a publicity stunt 
 What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow 
 Hip-hop would really be fucked 
 Something like Milli Vanilli 
 Nothing different, quite similar 
 Filling up my mind capacity 
 Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony 
 What if the shooter- 
 Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side 
 Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died 
 Now lets rewind 
  
 [Hook-D'Angelo] 
 Before we go 
 Can you imagine? 
 Picture years, with your mom 
 Can you imagine? 
 Hang her picture in the sky 
 Can you imagine? 
 Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 Imagine if Tookie was a Blood, Look, no disrespect 
 But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets 
 Dominating the population of- 
 L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay 
 Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit 
 Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit 
 No drive bys, no flags stickin' out pockets 
 No NWA dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru 
 Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two 
 Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive 
 Or would he been lost his life to the streets 
 No match, no cars in that driveway 
 What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin 
 On this L.A. strip, would these rap n*ggas use his name 
 Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap would they try to fall back on this drug game 
 These rappers ass backwards 
 Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine 
 Not to smoke, but to slang 
 Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane 
 Just think about it 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Punch] 
 Imagine life without death would you even feel alive 
 Your people that passed, what if they never died 
 Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness 
 Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness 
 The street living what if the crack epidemic 
 Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings 
 Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims 
 Imagine if heroine didn't affect our system 
 They say drug money funding the labels today 
 What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A 
 Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets 
 Would they start in the hood, or executive suites 
 Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me 
 You could possibly live without heat 
 Imagine if Al Gore, had won that election 
 Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected 
 Imagine the penal system without witness protection 
 Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling 
 I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind 
 Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine 
  
 (Training day, training day)[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Been ready 
 Jay, I been ready 
 HOV, I been ready 
 They say patience 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick] 
 Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong 
 Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on 
 Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born 
 "Is he really fucking with Sean?" 
 I reply, "His pick, I would take a tool on." 
 Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later 
 Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player 
 Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other 
 Came back definition of a "young motherfucker" with a problem 
 "Future of the West Coast" I am 
 And that's real tough 
 Southern California, Angels, AKA LA's Chucks 
 Make comparisons when I seen him duck 
 Man you think "What was to Pac and Big, before?" 
 And that was before 
 I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore 
 And then I started writing with it 
 Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore 
 He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll 
 He is cut from a different cloth 
 Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost 
 Like igloo, every time I come off 
 Every time I take off 
 Pandemonium when I take off 
 They hanging on the wing of that G4 
 30,000 feet and still won't fall 
 Why you do that for? 
 Why you had to sell out that store 
 You made my record sales come up short 
 My reply is that it ain't my fault 
 Blame God 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick] 
 I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming) 
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming) 
 I know that patience is virtue 
 But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you 
 No lie (No lie) 
  
 I can't wait when its my time (My time) 
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time) 
 I know that patience is virtue 
 But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you 
 No lie (No lie) 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick] 
 When the lights get dark 
 And every body quiet, know its my part 
 I might start a riot 
 The main event 
 Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit 
 I never played the bench 
 Star Point Guard 
 Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog 
 Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles 
 I never had no flaws 
 "Ooos" and "Ahhs" after every bar 
 Take your bitch, then give her back 
 For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard 
 I'm bein myself 
 And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured 
 You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord 
 Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure 
 Back seat got a flock of broads 
 And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like "Sure" 
 Momma gon' clean or fix it 
 Use Terrific, Easter Brum???????? 
 All it need is a little season on 
 Who said a veteran can't be so young? 
 I sound better than half ya'll on 
 Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm 
 I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform 
 I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform 
 Princess cut looks stupid dumb 
 Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs 
 And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time 
 No Lie 
 Blame God 
  
 [Hook] 
 [Hook 1: Kendrick] 
 I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming) 
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming) 
 I know that patience is virtue 
 But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you 
 No lie (No lie) 
  
 I can't wait when its my time (My time) 
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time) 
 I know that patience is virtue 
 But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you 
 No lie (No lie)[Intro] 
 Yea that's right you better walk away 
 Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down 
 King Kong ain't got shit on me 
  
 [Verse] 
 Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing 
 But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me 
 I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be 
 His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee 
 So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be 
 Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late 
 Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete 
 Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade 
 She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A' 
 Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip 
 Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off 
 I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf 
 I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car 
 And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom 
 Shit, make room for the lil bastard 
 The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus 
 The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down 
 They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security 
 No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you 
 If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you 
 I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you 
 Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable 
 Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself 
 Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help 
 I need some help, they say that my screws is loose 
 Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true 
 You tough rappers, I'm talking to you 
 He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew 
 He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue 
 That he just a puppy living in this zoo 
 Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth 
 The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse 
 I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished 
 Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence 
 I never sat the benches in the game of life 
 I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ 
 I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice 
 I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it 
 I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting 
 On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded? 
 The CL got my head spinning awkward 
 Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction 
 I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful 
 And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you 
 The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you 
 The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you 
 I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you 
 Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me 
 They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me 
 Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents 
 I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners 
 I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner 
 Killing 'em whenever my performance come 
 When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done 
 When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears 
 Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me 
 Shit, the new money is here for meAlbum Cover: 
  
 Deluxe Cover:I return before tables get turned 
 It’s my turn, spur of the moment 
 They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm 
 Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it 
 I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent 
 You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much 
 Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause 
 You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl 
 You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening 
 More reckless than a paisa driving without a license 
 Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking 
 They said no, the industry let it go 
 I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices 
 Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices 
 Uppin’ the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear 
 Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson 
 Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys 
 They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties 
 Haters’ll spike it 
 Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis 
 But I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law 
 Track em down like the subway when they sub-par 
 Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues 
 Send the angels, send the God 
 I can make you look hard, I know 
 I just let the thoughts take its toll 
 More sentences than level four of y’all, Bogard

 I’m a killer B, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield 
 This is not your cup of tea, and oh 
 They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles 
 And you will see us, we must leave dust behind 
 Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined 
 When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind 
 Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake 
 That ain't safe 
 Compton![Intro] 
 Mic check Ali 
 The mic don't sound right 
  
 Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick 
 Even the shooters can get shot (Ali get it right) 
 Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick 
 Even the shooters can get shot 
 Uhh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em 
 Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly 
 I write till I ignite my cerebellum 
 Close to the pen like I had 3 felons 
 Come from a city where niggas show no remorse 
 And a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course 
 Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four 
 Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4 
 So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired 
 My pops knew a security job he inquired 
 But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told 
 I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired 
 Now there goes another black boy unemployed 
 With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime 
 I wrote it in my rhymes 
 And when I left the porch this is what I realized 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick 
 Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick 
 Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?) 
 These streets ain't none to play with 
 It could get outrageous 
 Got burners, .45's and gauges 
 That could really get outrageous 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 So I'm thinking to myself, what's next? 
 My security job only got me like 2 checks 
 My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up 
 Irresponsible and I need some growing up 
 I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back 
 Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldn't stomach 
 Surrounded by the violence 
 All the goons and the goblins 
 With 99 problems I still kept it 100 
 These streets can be rather manipulating 
 Especially when you're black and just turned 18 
 So what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you? 
 Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists 
 Osama with badges that talk arrogant 
 That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45 
 30 years apart, 30 years before he realized 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Uhh 
 Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop 
 On a block close to you like a relative 
 You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere 
 Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters 
 And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to 
 You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger 
 Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it 
 Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick 
 Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight 
 With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it 
 You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music 
 Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near 
 This is the realest right here 
 When I lost my very first job 
 My pops said why? 
 I said I couldn't aim for the sky 
 Cuz even shooters can get shot 
  
 [Outro] 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?) 
 These streets ain't none to play with 
 It could get outrageous 
 Got burners, .45's and gauges 
 That could really get outrageousAs my mind drift and then split 
 Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off 
 The cliff of the unknown 
 I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same 
 Just antonyms of another age 
 My soul flock with the carefree 
 Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D 
 Haha LMFAO 
 I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo 
 Then spread slugs 
 My brain matter is a brain phantom 
 See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya 
 This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps 
 I'm about to go and cop a halo 
 The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars 
 And marbles with Pluto and Venus 
 Witness the genius, I interact with the inner city villains 
 That enters your system like a computer hack 
 Then give you dap[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 Ughh 
 Yeah 
 Kendrick Lamar 
 Ha ha haha HA 
  
 This feels like, right in front of the freeway 
 And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ 
 I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay 
 Then expect excellence knowing their effortless 
 I don't have a preference, I dislike all 
 Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball 
 I spread love as well 
 Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail 
 Ugh 
 Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious 
 The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken 
 The moon and the stars align with the bars 
 The broads are snapping their bras in broad day 
 Cops meeting their quota running for arcades 
 The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's 
 The end is almost near, inferior of nothing 
 Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra 
 On the roster, top running 
 Running races with my own shadow 
 Look in the mirror then I start to battle 
 Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard 
 Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve 
 Talkin bout they move birds 
 Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb 
 I am now on the verge of telling the real story 
 Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me" 
 Cus you fabricated the realness 
 The county building and the county children on food stamps 
 Glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp" 
 But that's never the case 
 Just a good lawyer who can sever the case 
 Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly 
 Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry 
 Like a desert 
 Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin? 
 What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon? 
 Well I got a profession my nigga 
 It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock 
 Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga 
 You want something, get something 
 I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1 
 UGH 
 Straight-A student who flow stupid 
 Real raps get permanent income, UGH 
  
 [Outro] 
 Beats and bars 
 Kendrick Lamar 
 Maestro whattup? 
  
 Ha ha haha[Intro, Clip from Denzel Washington in Training Day] 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This is a public service announcement 
 We call it Blood Sport 
 I had to do one too, I sorry! I'm a competitor 
 Oh my god it about to get hideous 
 I hope ya niggas know you history 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Homie go ask Doc (talk about me) 
 Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya) 
 Homie go ask Jay (young fella) 
 But when you ask them all (don't be jealous) 
 I'm the best in LA. In LA 
 Or wherever the fuck that you stay 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It's all copastetic. Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon 
 Call me Bruce Willis 
 No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz 
 So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno 
 I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck 
 No she lying 
 Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it 
 You abusing the game you defiant 
 Disobedient student need attention 
 Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son 
 I am Dwyane Wade of recording 
 You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements 
 That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless 
 I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues 
 I suppose I handle the rock well 
 I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll 
 The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell 
 You washed up like Nick Van Exel. 
 Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench 
 Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics 
 My team something like the retro Celtics 
 Which means consecutive championships 
 Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent 
 To the way I do a verse he handle the ball 
 The same way I handle it with no pen 
 I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off 
 He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court 
 Alley oop the court let him do what he want 
 Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports 
 How bout football? 
 I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984 
 I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning 
 Play the field like Ray Buchanan 
 When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary 
 Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry 
 Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry 
 Sanders... John Madden hold your commentary 
 Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion 
 Should I keep going? 
 Aw fuck it let me keep going 
 I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens 
 Not the ‘07 T Owens 
 T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin 
 Y'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend 
 Maneuver like Warrick Dunn 
 I'm just having a little fun have some with me 
 Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey 
 One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza 
 MVP of LA, call the doctor 
 I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something 
 It’s about time for halftime reporting 
 I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man 
 I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand 
 You ain’t nice till you play all positions 
 Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min 
 I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend 
 I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in 
 You might say… ouch 
 Just let me score one time 
 Dribble my balls to the floor one time 
 I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan 
 I am the Jeff Gordon of recording 
 I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding 
 I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin' 
 Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important 
 After this you gon applaud him 
 If not, fuck it I’m blood sportin' 
 Homie I’m blood sport… 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ya’ll niggas ran out of time to get ya’ll shit together man 
 I’m here 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey Moose what I gotta do boy[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill 
 Angry adolescents, three things on our minds 
 Money, murder and you 
  
 [Hook: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky] 
 I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem 
 And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem 
 I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem 
 And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem 
 I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem 
 And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem 
 (If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem) 
 Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Picture perfect, uh huh 
 And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer 
 But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya 
 Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga 
 Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh) 
 Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux 
 Head all in the bathroom 
 Beg for it, I'll be back soon 
 Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems 
 I got my own but one ain't a dollar 
 I got five phones for five different reasons 
 London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha 
 Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas 
 Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza 
 Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear 
 One on both arm but need two pair, I beast 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yeah ho, this the finale 
 My pep talk turn into a pep rally 
 Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now 
 Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm 
 Got your girl on my line, world on my line 
 The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time 
 She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist 
 Girl, I know you want this dick 
 Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar 
 A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car 
 That mean your friends-es need be up to par 
 See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm 
 Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway 
 Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say 
 Halle Berry, hallelujah 
 Holla back, I'll do ya, beast 
  
 [Hook][Verse] 
 Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side 
 Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high 
 Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9 
 Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive 
 So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi 
 From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines 
 Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready 
 Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee 
 Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer 
 But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya 
 I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar 
 So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off 
 This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche 
 That's not your favorite rapper in the booth 
 That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos 
 Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom 
 Smell the fumes on my Levis 
 Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms 
 I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot 
 Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me 
 Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen 
 Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen 
 Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker

 Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Can I pay my past a visit? 
 Centennial Compton School District 
 And video campus shut the fuck up your premises 
 King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches 
 And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over 
 Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda 
 Every time we rode up we was unsober 
 And everybody had know that 
 My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat 
 Which was really dumb because where we was at 
 Was the other side and more than likely 
 The other side really didn't like that 
 Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back 
 Could of lost our life over hood rats 
 We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough 
 That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from 
 I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch 
 She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6 
 But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows 
 Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows 
 Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin 
 He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get 
 Now let me get back to the plan 
 Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?" 
 She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah 
 Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans" 
 Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck 
 He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?" 
 She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung 
 I can work that pussy and the tongue 
 If you come over I can make you cum 
 If you come over make sure that you bring drink 
 Because I like to get to drunk." 
 And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived 
 Notice that he was out of bounds 
 But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now 
 Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down 
 Oldies playing in the background 
 Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning 
 Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor 
 Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door 
 When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh! 
 Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with 
  
 [Hook] 
 And that's how you get your ass killed bitch! 
 That's how you get your ass killed bitch! 
 That's how you get your ass killed bitch! 
 Get your ass killed bitch! How? 
 Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes 
 Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes 
 Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes 
 But your first mistake, might be your death date 
 And death doesn't wait, on no one 
 A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one 
 If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes 
 Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude 
 He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two 
 When he went to first get put on the hood 
 He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good 
 But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose 
 Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless 
 His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money 
 The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy 
 And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller 
 But he wasn't no killa 
 Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas 
 Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one 
 Never pull out if you don't use it 
 Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising 
 Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit 
  
 [Hook] 
 And that's how he got his ass killed bitch! 
 That's how he got his ass killed bitch! 
 That's how he got his ass killed bitch! 
 Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How? 
 Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes 
 The G codes, the codes the codes 
 The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead 
 Feel me?Uh 
 Yeah 
 Kendrick Lamar 
 Uh 
 Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad 
 I'm  a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag; 
 Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novacane stabs 
 In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad 
 Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em 
 Colours corresponding to gangs upon us 
 Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city 
 Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save; 
 Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right? 
 Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights; 
 Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five? 
 I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds; 
 This kid named Jonathan was monitoring 
 His momma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him; 
 Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing 
 To Johnny, he might've been 
 A modern day rider then 
 He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member 
 Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big 
 Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now? 
 He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one 
 More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC 
 Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me" 
 No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy; 
 Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs 
 With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks 
 Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace 
 Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour; 
 The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots) 
 Little Johnny 
  
 [Outro: Voice of Malcolm X and (Kendrick Lamar)] 
  
 I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time 
 When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough 
 To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves 
 Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people 
 And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together 
 And then at that point you will have a situation 
 Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men 
 And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together 
 And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people) 
 And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it 
 No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it 
 It's something that the black man has to bring an end toNow everybody sing that shit 
 [Sampled from "The Game – The City"] 
  
 [Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar] 
 Johnny always lock a nigga down 
 Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao 
 Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac 
 In his prime, thug life is now on radar 
 Til the federal come through and raid ours 
 Reminiscing when the LA Raiders 
 Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome 
 [X4] 
 Snapback fitted 
 Snapback fitted 
 Snapback fitted 
 On my uncle's dome 
 And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to 
 Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die 
 And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion 
 Trying, and I mean that shit 
 Game came through, put the city on his back 
 I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit 
 "Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit 
 Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit 
 Can't block or screen that shit[X2] 
 Can't block or

 Come on 
 Me, I've been searching, for that right one 
 And hopefully I found her 
 I found her 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh 
 Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh 
 Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh 
 Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone 
 When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said 
  
 [Hook] 
 A friend of mine said that you were the one for me 
 A friend of mine said that you was with everything 
 A friend of mine said that you are good company 
 A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby 
 Got good pussy baby 
 Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious 
 I want it baby 
 Gotta have it baby 
 Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong 
 But I heard that you got the love that I want 
 Can you promise me that it's true what they say? 
 Before you tell me your name? Is you with it? 
  
 [Hook] 
 A friend of mine said that you were the one for me 
 A friend of mine said that you was with everything 
 A friend of mine said that you are good company 
 A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby 
 Got good pussy baby 
 Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious 
 I want it baby 
 Gotta have it baby 
 Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious 
 {Bridge} 
 Tell me is you with it? 
 Is you with it? (4 times) 
 Tell me are you with it? 
 Are you with it? (4 more times) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff 
 That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff 
 Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough 
 I can be your lover, be your friend 
 Be your number one or your ten 
 Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send 
 Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning 
 Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need 
 Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's 
 I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene 
 I truly understand 
 Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men 
 So momma don't trip 
 And if it goes well we can make you a flip 
  
 So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin' 
 So please tell me you accept my proposition 
 Are you gonna tell me now? 
 Or you need more time if you do that's fine 
 As long as it goes down, girl make up your mind[Emily Main] 
 You're the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat 
 You're the one I'd risk my life and waste it on a bet 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Temptation sweet, I taste it 
 That casino waitress, drinks sedated 
 You the one I want, you the one I want, face it 
 You the one I want on a one-on-one basis 
 You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough 
 I need every season and this the only reason 
 You the one I want, you the one I want 
 Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin' 
 Doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it 
 Probably twenty more before I'm done 
 If gambling's a sin, then I'm rollin' dice with Lucifer 
 To make sure I ain't losin' you 
 That's what a crab shooter does, I'm bankin' on the win 
 Bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that I had 
 Life savings in my pocket 
 If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin' a risk 
 So before I slit my wrist, I'm a cash in on this last poker chip 
 You can bet 
  
 [Hook: Emily Main] 
 Ooh, Vegas, baby, ooh, Vegas, baby 
 Ooh, Vegas, baby, I was scared of you 
 Ooh, Vegas, baby, you're Vegas, baby 
 You're Vegas baby, I was scared of you 
  
 [Outro: Emily Main] 
 You're the one who's got me drinkin' wine until I'm fallin' down 
 You're the one who keeps the slot machines spinnin' around[Verse 1] 
 Cloud nine, where you can find me and my dime 
 Like Roosevelt in his prime, wait till I'm in my prime 
 The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion 
 To whom say he cool 
 But the irony is I can hold the bottom of an iron 
 With the bottom of my palm 
 I say so much so little, all action, no talk 
 Like a mime throwin' up gang signs 
 It's not all about punchlines, I don't do that 
 I'm a jaguar, you just a new cat, now move back 
 Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success 
 Aimin' for the top like an AR aimed at your neck 
 I can never digress ‘less I get demoted to death 
 Even then I’ll be the best still like a petty theft 
 I will conquer my biggest dreams 
 Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings 
 Nipsey got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred 
 And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head 
 But still they’ll feel me cause we all ate cereal 
 Humped the momma friend daughter while they bump the stereo 
 Backflips on shoppin' carts, free lunch at the park 
 Watched Power Rangers after school, here we go 
 I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise 
 For no fussy-ass A&R or TEO 
 We ain't what you think and you think we back 
 But we been here for decades and I vouch for that 
 Open your mouth for that 
 Speak well like a great debater over iChat 
 Get your other eye cracked 
 I don’t rap, I Iraq and declare war 
 I enjoy watchin' enemies' blood pour 
 I came up lower middle class, not poor 
 So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me 
 I need y’all to feel me 
 And if you feelin' froggy to leap, then feel free 
 My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived 
 By the ultimate prize I'm a get when I see your suicide 
  
 [Hook] 
 Too hot to handle, too dope to hold 
 Two dope boys, we roll deep, everybody gather your seats 
 We goin' to cloud nine, we comin' back in a week 
 And the weak good riddance 
 Only the strong permitted to ride and test drive 
 With Kendrick the Jedi 
 One of a kind like great antiques museums buy 
 Haters, I tell 'em, 'Hi', enemies, I don't tell 'em shit but puta 
 Click, booyah, click, click[Produced by Robin Thicke]

 [Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
 I'm starin' at you and you look so good 
 I want it in the back seat and on top of the hood 
 And, I would do it all day if I could 
 Put a lumberjack on and give you the wood 
 You gotta man and that's understood 
 But I gotta girlfriend too, this a mutual move 
 So we do what grown folk do 
 She had a new lit candle on the table for two 
 A home cooked meal with the best soul food 
 I told her "get on my plate, I'll just have you" 
 You can sit on my face after I say grace 
 Or I could just beat it up like I knew kung fu 
 We ended up in the kitchen with a sink full of dishes 
 Then I sat her on the stove like a pot when I hit it 
 She never want me to stop when I'm in it 
 Not even a minute until she finish 
 Then I don't 
  
 [Bridge: Ab-Soul] 
 She works at the corner store 
 She is so bad, so bad, so... 
 I said "my name is Soul 
 Store me inside you phone 
 We need some time alone 
 In our near future, future 
 Cause I am tryin' to bone 
 Whenever your man ain't home 
  
 [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
 Take off your pants, baby 
 And come to me 
 We done had all this drank 
 We done smoked all this weed 
 Take off your pants 
 Dont be scared of me 
 I won't hurt you girl 
 I'll be your therapy 
  
 [Verse 2: Ab-Soul] 
 When I come from out of that pussy 
 And I smell fresh air 
 You lost your voice yelling 
 "Pull my long ass hair!" 
 Had the 112 Clan 
 We could do it anywhere 
 I ask her where she want it next 
 She started staring at the stairs 
 So we did it on the stairs 
 And we took it upstairs 
 Then we came back down 
 When she came and she gave me 
 The crown that I wear, right now 
 Then I bounce like rubber 
 Just in case her man come unannounced 
 Send me a text message saying it was the bomb 
 I send her a text like "hit me when he gone 
 So we can continue to creep." 
 And now I'm in the sheets 3 days out the week 
 Freaks come out at night 
 But I'm up in the morning 
 And she up in the morning 
 So we gon' fuck in the morning 
 My only problem is running out of condoms 
 She say she on the patch, but I can't buy that 
  
 [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
  
 [Verse 3: Ab-Soul] 
 Knock on the door 
 He isn't home 
 Shes all alone 
 Her legs so long 
 Don't ask me whats wrong 
 Ask me whats right 
 Cuz I just wanna lay pipe for your info 
 She do tricks on the dick this is how I know 
 She make my whole shit disappear down her throat 
 And this a trip, she don't even choke 
 And I beat like a heart, she can feel a pulse 
 Beat, beat, beat, beat....[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It's over, it's really over 
 Kobe really retired, it's crazy! 
 It's just a trip to even be doing this right now 
 Kobe really retiring 
  
 [Director] 
 Call in marks, Kendrick take one 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 What can I say? 
 I mean really, what can we say? 
 Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact 
 Growing up watching him paint murals 
 Using this building as his first studio 
 Using L.A. as his canvas 
 Restoring crowns back to where they belong 
 Under royal banners, purple and gold 
 The color of royalty 
 My one man L.A. king 
  
 [Announcer] 
 Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up 
 Oh! What a way to finish! 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 Kobe 
 Never meaningless could never mean less 
 That's what he means at this moment 
 All season has been his goodbye 
 Him to us, us to him, to the whole world 
  
 [Sample from untitled 07] 
  
 Still got magic, but he made it magical 
 From Compton to Crenshaw 
 Jack to Jeanie 
 We were all witnesses 
 To all things that was him 
 I mean, we shared with him the world 
  
 [Announcer] 
 Kobe, inside the three point arc... 
 Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer! 
  
 [Kobe Bryant] 
 WOO! 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 Soon enough, he became our identity 
 If you wasn't born and raised here 
 Or never lived here 
 You probably would never understand 
 I'm-a make sure you do 
  
 I'm talking about the 81 points 
 I'm talking about the afro 
 I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq 
 The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade 
 The game four overtime takeover in the Finals 
  
 Kobe 
 I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash 
 I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized 
 You remember that 
 Kobe bodied him 
 The helicopter 
 The five parades 
 Kobe 
  
 [Sample from untitled 07] 
  
 The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep 
 I don't think nobody can break that bond 
 So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor? 
 I mean, we got you 
 But at the same time, we got you 
 I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears 
 Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man 
 And nothing would ever replace that or erase that 
 Forever great in our hearts 
 So with that being said 
 Know that it's never goodbye 
 It's simply respect due 
 Our due, forever

 When I jumped off the porch 
 I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short 
 And, of course, when that took its course 
 I was hoarse from yelling out 
 Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice 
 The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost 
 And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey 
 Caught a bullet that probably destroyed 
 A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed 
 I walked down the street with no heat 
 And run into beef when I'm just a vegan 
 Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing 
 Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason 
 Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood 
 That was bloodin' in public 
 And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin 
 But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy 
 Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy 
 Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang 
 But that's the repercussions like 
 When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood 
 Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said: 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (pump, pump) 
 A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (pump) 
 I do my stuff (pump) 
 I’m really from the sect, tho (pump, pump) 
 And if you is or ain't, I still need to know 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw 
 Like on the ground, you know the sound 
 When you hear the people in awe 
 Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you 
 Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas 
 I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back 
 And pajamas was almost needed 
 I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep 
 When I greeted the pavement 
 Got up and seen the shock on their faces 
 Like "damn it, he made it" 
 My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb 
 And they waitin' to blow up on me 
 My homies are not alarmed 
 Then I heard someone's firearm 
 Make a sound like it waved around my direction 
 I'm guessing this is the part where my heart 
 Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults 
 I've made in the shortest amount of time 
 And in back of my mind I'm like "this the loss I'ma take" 
 My fate was distraught 
 A cape and some superpowers can't save me 
 I'm probably pushing up daisies 
 Before I can make my way to the car 
 Cross cancel and right before I seen 
 The black glove raisin' the handle, he said: 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (pump, pump) 
 A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (pump) 
 I do my stuff (pump) 
 I'm really from the sect, tho (pump, pump) 
 And if you is or ain't, I still need to know 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute 
 Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap 
 I was timid but now I'm tempted 
 And tenants alert me on where you at 
 I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react 
 Then somebody said the dispatch 
 Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya 
 That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped 
 You're profiled as a felon 
 I'm bellin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack 
 Gym shoes and my nap sack 
 Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards 
 And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe 
 Turned left then I turned right 
 Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud 
 As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes 
 Pray to God I don't get sniped 
 Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes 
 Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine 
 Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin' 
 Even though being a criminal ain't my memo 
 But this is what he said when I dropped the window: 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang 
 By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (pump) 
 I do my stuff (pump) 
 I'm really from the sect, tho (pump, pump) 
 And if you is or ain't, I still need to know 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay 
 Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q] 
 You been down with me since I first started 
 No love for a friend, baby girl cold-hearted 
 I know it's really hard to believe 
 But fuck her with the shoe, I probably would never succeed 
 On my knees, beggin', 'Please' for the Lord to forgive me 
 I tried to bounce, but your spirit had bit me 
 I'm drinkin' the Remy, killin' niggas, squeezin' the semi 
 Ridin' 'round in a Cutlass, shit, I need me a Bentley 
 I missed bail cause of you, nigga, went to jail cause of you 
 Trialed niggas in my cell cause of you 
 I squeeze shells cause of you, I wouldn't tell cause of you 
 Even probably brought my ticket down to hell cause of you 
 Damn, look, see, I'm knowin' that I'm 'posed to shake 
 But anytime I leave you, I'm feelin' my heart ache 
 Hope you feelin' my vibe, holmes 
 Nah, not a chick, I mean the shit that you drive, holmes 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You did me wrong, you put me down 
 Made me feel low when you're around 
 And you broke my heart, you broke my heart 
 My chips went down, it was you I needed 
 But I was not down, baby, barely breathin' 
 And you broke my heart 
 You broke my heart 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Livin' a double life, havin' double shots of Patrón 
 With my mistress 'stead of my wife, I was on 
 Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?' 
 I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not 
 Story of the 80–20 rule is me 
 Movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat 
 Way back, her perfume on my white tee 
 Ignorin' calls from my wifey 
 See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut 
 And she had some great dome 
 Like the New Orleans Saints when they're playin' at home 
 What's a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy 
 Then my conscious called me, 'Pussy' 
 You don't understand, mama had ass 
 And I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man... 
 I never thought of the day I would quit 
 Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You did me wrong, you put me down 
 Made me feel low when you're around 
 And you broke my heart, you broke my heart 
 My chips went down, it was you I needed 
 But I was not down, baby, barely breathin' 
 And you broke my heart 
 You broke my heart[Intro] 
 Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh 
 Well you know what niggas 
 I'mma just play Kendrick 
 You gotta respect it 
 Feel this 
 Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood 
 Homie I'm just Kendrick 
 See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment 
 Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant 
 Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant 
 Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it 
 You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie 
 Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit 
 But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit 
 Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit 
 I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit 
 You better guard your bitch 
 ‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes 
 Something like a lightswitch 
 Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche 
 ‘Cause it got a better steering grip 
 Young but been a man and you won't understand 
 Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan 
  
 [Hook] 
 When the beef start cooking 
 And the shots start coming 
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing 
 People start looking 
 And people start running 
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing 
 Rolling down Rosecrans 
 I fear no man 
 I be God damned 
 If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet 
 That hub city threat shit is me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan 
 And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants 
 I got some plans, to stack riches 
 Own 76′s like a Philadelphian 
 You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens 
 And if I know your mans I might give a second chance 
 ‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you 
 Have ‘em running in herzels 
 Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle 
 Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue 
 Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple 
 Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple 
 2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel 
 I suspend they murk you, what you lying for? 
 You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials 
 Man my children circle around your block 
 Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew 
  
 [Hook] 
 When the beef start cooking 
 And the shots start coming 
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing 
 People start looking 
 And people start running 
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing 
 Rolling down Rosecrans 
 I fear no man 
 I be God damned 
 If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet 
 That hub city threat shit is me 
  
 [Outro]

 [Verse 1] 
 I say thinkin' of a master plan 
 Motherfucker I'm a mastermind, I'm an 18 year old dollar sign 
 I'm a one man tragedy

 I'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine 
 Penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up 
 Good lookin hunk 
 Lookin for anybody thats lookin for me 
 Shotty look em right in the eye 
 What do I see 
 A scared nigga waitin to die 
 A scared nigga I even got you a suit and tie 
 Something suitable 
 Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles 
 Nigga I do the unusual 
 Torture 
 Any thing is necessary in the art of war 
 Slam his head inside the suicidal doors 
 Do him like lil man off players club 
 Roll around to his knees rub 
 Shit 
 Im a ground hog 
 No Im a young hog 
 Hoggin up all the money from all a yall 
 Its funny how all yall wanna be my associates 
 Come around smile like that shit is appropriate 
 I'mma put it to your skullcap and open it 
 Leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin wit 
 Im rollin with the 9mm close to my nuts and dick 
 You know who you fuckin with 
 Im done with regular bowel movements Im on some other shit 
 Im a fuckin beast you a fuckin bitch 
 Im a fuck your bitch 
 Then send her back to you 
 Let her suck some dick then let her kiss on you

 But that’s my life

 Syke, you gon’ be fightin a bullet

 Where the pump at 
 Thinking of a master plan 
 Mothafucker Im a master mind 
 Im a 18 year old dollar sign 
 Im a one man tragedy 
 Im Columbine 
 Shit you already know what im about 
 Keep the guns by the couch in the living room 
 Company act up we give it to them 
 Send it to them like emails 
 Let them sell his soul 
 Put his body on retail 
 If we do dirt 
 And you tell 
 We gon’ put you under dirt 
 He was a good person 
 He was down to earth but now he down to earth 
 Chillin with the worms and the insects his brother gon’ be next 
 His mother gon’ be after him kill the family tree 
 If they fuckin with him and that him is me 
 And that limb is lost on your body 
 Aiming at your feet probably 
  
 [Outro]

 And tell me what's happening with it 
 Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me 
 Soon as they see me, they be like 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 What up doc 
 That's what they tell me every second around the clock 
 Everytime I clock in, rappers checkin' they watch 
 Studio paid for, hours unlimited 
 Assholes, how many MC's I knock off they payroll? 
 How many God MC's I knock off they halo? 
 Hip-Hop ain’t dead, consumers changed up 
 Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow 
 I stay low, like my socks under my ankles 
 Play the back like a turtle shell, know well 
 That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so if I fall? 
 Guess what, I don't even trip 
 It's like that, crushin' little battle raps 
 Punchlines, I did that in '99, you think it's a gold mine when you think of one 
 You think you hot, but I think you done 
 Like Queens, New York slang, look what the killer brung 
 Machine guns to a fight, fucking right 
 Pay the bill or I'm turning out your lights, good night 
 I shatter niggas' dreams, thinkin' they the West Coast kings 
 Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it ain't always what it seems 
 Like the stitching on swap meet jeans 
 I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper 
 Got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off, at ya 
  
 [Hook] 
 The real is back 
 Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap 
 They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts 
 Safe estate, they know where the best be at 
 Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?" 
 Body any nigga that wanna holla my name 
 And what, no cut, this is Top Dawg gang 
 What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets 
 What chain? I barely wear jewelry 
 So I ever had one, you barely seen it on me 
 And if I ever had a gun, you wouldn't know it was on me 
 So snatch it and then you're done 
 I'm in a studio, just sipping on Parmesan 
 Thinkin' about who could fuck with Kenny and Paula's son 
 I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit properly 
 Catch four between your abdomen 
 Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabin' with 
 Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses 
 New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit 
 But still we continue to drink laxatives 
 Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget 
 This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter? 
 Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo 
 Yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me 
  
 [Hook] 
 The real is back

 [Verse 3] 
 Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle 
 And if you don't kill 'em, then you send 'em to hospitals 
 Sleepin' on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow 
 I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow 
 Bet I dribble to the end of my lifeline 
 So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time 
 The 0-8 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch 
 Feet size thirty-six, steppin' on Hip-Hop 'cause that's my bitch 
 I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick 
 The girl is mine, I don't know the ho that you with 
 You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been 
 So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in 
 What's your motive? 
 I bet it's to go against, like the GT 
 Get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets 
 I'm the almighty K, Compton 
 Rep it 'til my very death day, let the reaper in his face 
 And recite every song from NWA 
 I pay homage for those great who paved the way 
 Wait, back to the subject of who's, and who doesn't do what I do 
 Bluffin' until I touch 'em like a masseuse do 
 Nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me 
 I'm a rare bully, small nigga but I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall 
 Nigga[Intro: Punch & Kendrick Lamar] 
 C4, K.Dot, let's get it 
 Yeah, Punch wanted me to come right in on the one 
 I didn't want to 
 I love this beat 
 I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental 
 And don't rap 
 But I won't do that 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Light an incense for little Kendrick 
 Little oh Kendrick 
 Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines 
 My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice 
 Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand 
 Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton bitch 
 Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch 
 The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket 
 Darker skin tone, you can only imagine 
 The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards 
 Kill em inside their kitchen and then stuffed them inside their cabinets 
 Death before dishonor, put that on my Mama 
 I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise 
 Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan, more drama only make more problems but 
  
 [Hook] 
 They gotta get shot down, cause we riding, we riding, we riding, they gotta get shot down, cause we riding, we riding 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Like a black rodeo, 44’s, calicos 
 Chop em up, stop em up like a stuffy nose 
 We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya tuck your tail bitch, hell is waiting on ya 
 While I’m praying on ya, not on my knees though, I mean praying on ya 
 I gotta feed ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite 
 After I eat you’re sure to see afterlife 
 Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins, because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again 
 I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga 
 Nigga does anybody killer, fuck your creed race or color 
 Son daughter sister mother brother gotta suffer 
 Bitch I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze please hand me the keys to the G-ride 
 They outside then 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Punch] 
 Somebody get ready for a murder, no more further announcements 
 Mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding 
 Either I retaliate or find self counseling 
  
 [Punch]: 
 Somebody got to die, simple mathematics 
 Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish 
 Or lets be diplomatic and less melodramatic 
 Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic 
 But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean 
 An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see 
 As our hearts bleed we proceed cautiously 
 Shoot them niggas down consciously that’s how 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1] 
 K.Dot, you know that he's hot 
 I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop 
 We talkin' 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown 
 We talkin' 'bout the white, it don't care who you around 
 It's all about the positivity when you with energy 
 If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me 
 If you see me then you know you can't intimidate me or be me 
 You can see we go for the energy 
 (K104) 
 K104 
 Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store 
 You know I'm rocking out, I got my people around me 
 We in the building and you know definitely you can't down me 
 And if the children... 
 (Dede) 
 And if the Dede, she called me cute 
 I walked in the building, I said yo, she got on boots 
 She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops 
 She got that long, brown hair, it's wrapped, yeah, she cute 
  
 [Interlude] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 He say I'm killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak 
 You know I got them flows and plus I've always been cheap 
 And they talk 'bout strip clubs, I talk 'bout ladies and hugs 
 We talking 'bout more abuse, we talking 'bout these drugs 
 We talking 'bout my lady to the right, she real fly 
 Say your name again, girl, don't be shy 
 (Lady Jade) 
 Lady Jade, she aways talkin' 'bout gettin' paid 
 And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed 
 Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate 
 They're always gonna play, play, play, play, play 
 No matter what they say, say, say, say, say 
 We're getting paid, boss, paid, boss 
 What's up?[Intro] 
 Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar 
 Breed up or speed up 
 Breed up or speed up 
 Breed up or speed up 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 This is for my niggas that be all blacked out 
 Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about? 
 Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us 
 Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light 
 Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight 
 You do it right or don't do it at all 
 Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie 
 Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball 
 Centre of attention like Bynum and GasolYou know that killer californication 
 When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing 
 Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation 
 It's abomination how we bomb yo' block 
 I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy 
 Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got 
 See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up 
 It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope 
  
 [Hook] 
 Pounding on the highway stretch 
 All blacked out, making sure we on deck 
 Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes 
 Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby 
 Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop) 
 Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop) 
 Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And it's like that to the death though 
 Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying 
 Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines 
 Or we might be in a hood near you 
 Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby 
 Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds 
 We heat it up in the cold baby 
 It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out 
 Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow 
 Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother 
 Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye 
 Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar 
 Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family 
 Stunting hard like a black circus, voila 
 Breed up or speed up, get ahead 
 So with that said, bye-bye

 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God 
 Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras 
 Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard 
 Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car 
 And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar 
 If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage 
 And that's night life, in Watts California 
 Parties ain't over till like six in the morning 
 This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out 
 Take another swig then I'm rolling out 
 If you ain't banging better hold your mouth 
 Don't claim nothing that you know you're not 
 So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short 
 Just stick to the script

 She wanna play play 
 But, what more can I say say? 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Jump in the coup and I'm gone 
 I smell like money, I don't need no cologne 
 I just need me a freak 
 That can jump on the bone 
 Like an X-Ray technician 
 My rectangular prism 
 Says money sex then drugs 
 All cause I'm 21 
 Like playing blackjack 
 Picture this kodak 
 Moment forever 
 K.Dot that dude 
 She sucked my dick and got frostbite 
 I'm that cool 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I got a pocket full of checks 
 Plus I'm bouncing through the club 
 With a crazy two-step 
 And diamonds on my neck 
 Ziploc fresh

 Hoes wanna play play 
 What more can I say say? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Bottle of goose and I'm gone 
 Watching her get loose 
 Like a third graders tooth 
 The shit that we on 
 Is the ultimate high 
 Double XL flow 
 That's the ultimate vibe 
 Park that Lambi' outside 
 Just to fuck with the haters 
 Put the Lami' in drive 
 Watch 'em peel like potatoes 
 Holla' LMAO 
 When they drunk and two-step 
 Like I never could pass 
 A sobriety test 
  
 [Bridge] 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm in the club I can manage 
 Providing lenses 
 Make my view panoramic 
 I'm out of this world 
 I'm off of this planet 
 They don't say K.Dot is here 
 They say his spaceship has landed 
 And your access has been granted 
 Like a kitchen floor 
 But my floor is marble 
 I ride in the carpool because I got two whores 
 In the back of that chrome 
 See they're all I need 
 Like Aaliyah alone 
  
 [Bridge] 
  
 [Hook][Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I fall in with an attitude, Billy badass with a back pack full of bad swag 
 That I picked out I'm a hand it out to, anyone that ever did wrong to me anything that 
 Did wrong to me I'm a take it back like a vac, you pay tax tonight. Bully! 
  
 [Verse 1: Mark Foster] 
 Robert's got a quick hand 
 He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan 
 He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid 
 Yeah, he found a six shooter gun 
 In his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things, and I don't even know what 
 But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you 
  
 [Hook: Mark Foster] (x2) 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Run boy 
 Are you ready 
 (Kendrick) 
 Do I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em 
 That I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind 
 Then I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine 
 I'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock 
 Climb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine! 
 Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me 
 Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat 
  
 [Hook: Mark Foster] (x2) 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
  
 [Hook] (x4)[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Swallow your pride and then eat a dick 
 Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit 
 I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick 
 Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch 
 I tell you that I'm one up 
 Sun down, or sun up 
 Son, I son niggas 
 I probably fucked your mama 
 With no condom 
 That's good pussy, pussy 
 Tell it to your honor 
 This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer 
 It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon 
 Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms 
 Man look, your man look like sweet water 
 Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up 
 They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk 
 And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off 
 I'm just a young boss in the batcave 
 Back against the wall 
 I came back with them back pains 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball 
 Like I'm Derrick Rose 
 Ho, know my gym 
 And players not allowed 
 I'm spiking your game towel 
 And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul 
 I'm in the crowd like Artest and them 
 I move the crowd like Artest and them 
 Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians 
 Crunch time mean I take it to the hole 
 Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in 
 I assassin you niggas 
 I make your weight shape thin 
 Blank tapes in your deck 
 You can still break they necks 
 They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin 
 I need to clear it with the bank just to spend 
 Club appearance go for twenty-five racks 
 When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin 
 So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner 
 But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner 
 Back when we ate canned food for dinner 
 I coached fools to protools to make my agenda 
 I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Get your whole career injured 
 Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon 
 I killed your favorite rapper 
 Favorite rapper last record 
 I fucked your favorite actress on the matress 
 What a blessing 
 Make that pussy ante up 
 She call my dick antidepressant 
 I'm really not impressed with 
 None of you niggas stressing 
 That some of you niggas blessed with 
 The gift to carry the presence 
 Picking popping 
 I'm popping big shit with label investments 
 Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds 
 Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session 
 Came up with shit, writer's block 
 Niggas up in this dressing like 
 "Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?" 
 Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire 
 Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer 
 Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer 
 Church to you pussies 
 You push me, get pap smeered 
 Burst out your cookie 
 I read it, my fortune is here 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks 
 And bitches rubbing on they tits 
 Until they fingers monkey wrenched 
 Monkey see what monkey do 
 You monkeys never make no sense 
 Jump up a tree, shit on you 
 Shitting bricks that can build a castle 
 No hastle when breaking your picket fence 
 Know pterodactyls that still exist 
 And clap you if you resist 
 Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate 
 And you at risk 
 You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist 
 You can taste it from planet Pluto 
 Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle 
 Rip out your culo, then kudos 
 Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more 
 Cause I [???] 
 Wipe it off on my shoe, ho 
 Before you [???] your Menthol 
 Meant to get smoked then sent off 
 To Jamaica 
 No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc 
 Means ain't no hood 
 Hopping California JACO 
 Watching Snoop's latest prince get down 
 Bitch, start popping fireworks 
 K. Dot[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic 
 Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere 
 That's the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve 
 "Wassup homie!", smoke a nigga then dip 
 It's the immaculate, verbal assassin 
 Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent 
 This the Jesus of Nazareth 
 Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown 
 In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed 
 No sticks, no seeds 
 Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states 
 My need for speak can corral the largest crowds 
 Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin' "Bitches ain't shit!" 
 She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower 
 I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder 
 No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental 
 Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein

 Gimme a hundred g's, for every emcee I dropped to their knees 
 Verbally useless 
 "Oh you got the juice!?" I squeeze you juiceless 
 Catch you, hang you, from any nooses 
 Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fuckin over Ruthless 
 Young and I'm ruthless 
 21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac 
 Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends 
 Bitch you's a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten 
 Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection 
 In the regal higher than church steeples 
 I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar 
 I'm a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon 
 Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin 
 Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean I'm the sickest 
 And Thera-flu won't do, whenever I'm kicking the wickedness 
 Explosive, cinematic, smoking

 The lil homie strapped and he with it 
 At the Avalon's swap meet, "wassup fool!?" 
 Blunt longer than Rosecrans 
 I grab the devil then slow dance 
 Practice trigonometry 
 Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches 
 You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this 
 West Coast with a big scope kill all yal 
 It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT 
 Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A-S-A-P 
 Complete havoc composer, disorder: rhyme addict 
 Slaughter houses full of Joeys, Joells, and Royces for ya 
 Live from the area code of 310 
 Laughing all the way to the bank with 3 elmos 
 Three 64's, 1 bottle of goose 
 I'm the truth 
 You can put ya hand on the bible and shoot 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm CorruptedWriter At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, “How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?” Nobody ever really asks about what it’s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can’t make a song like “i” without being in that dark place. “i” comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, “Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.” Or “I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.” 
  
 I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn’t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it’s a whole different story to me. That’s when I learned that while I’m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that’s spooky 
  
 I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term “role model.” You would say, “I don’t wanna be a role model. I don’t want none of that.” But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It’s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don’t get a response like, “Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?” Or, “I wanna just take this picture with you.” No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something 
 [Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it 
 Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others 
  
 I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights 
  
  
  
  
 I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things 
  
 It’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta accept 
 When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it 
  
 I’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least 
  
  
  
  
 My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?” 
  
 I was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.” 
 I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family 
  
 Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyrics 
 Kendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it 
  
 I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at it 
  
 From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writing 
 So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear 
  
 When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear 
  
  
  
  
 It’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired 
  
 What’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.” 
  
 Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back 
 [Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep 
  
 I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that 
 What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s bigger 
  
 The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them? 
  
 Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day 
  
 The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being 
  
 What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity[Hook] 
 If I gotta ride 
 Then you's gonna die 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones 
 Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone 
 Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones 
 Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs 
 I'm hot as an oven you just a pressin' comb 
 I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home 
 And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on 
 I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone 
 I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone 
 I don't care about friends I was made to be on my own 
 I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone 
 Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own 
 With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia dome 
 Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome 
 Give your homies a reason to make a memory song 
 Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on 
 Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam 
 You better hold your breath I give you workin' death 
 And recommend the gun be your chaperone 
 I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone 
 And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit 
 I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way 
 Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs 
 You can play the boss but if you get shot 
 From bein on top then homie that's your loss 
 I'm nice wit it 
 I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs 
 The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox 
 Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock 
 And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor 
 Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox 
 You ain't a thug homie you just a fox 
 In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks 
 And I'm really from the streets 
 So if I ask for beef homeboy don't bring me no pork chop 
 I turn your skin to pork homie with one chop 
 With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks 
 They say the flow is crack 
 So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot 
 I swear 
  
 [Hook] 
 If I gotta ride 
 Then you's gonna die[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, DJ talking] 
 (Work out for me, work out for me) 
 (Work out for me, work out for me) 
  
 [Verse One: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Feeling like a mother fucking animal 
 Hannibal Lecter of 2012 
 Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled 
 If music is your calling 
 You're falling, pick up yourself 
 If a nigga said he could see me 
 Bet he told you in Braille, fucker 
 Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread 
 Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead 
 Goliath couldn't bare my triumph 
 I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion 
 Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan 
 Watch they face drop when the beat drop 
 I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool 
 Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin 
 Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting 
 No judgement for a plaintiff 
 They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B 
 But I've been O.D. since '03 
 That's March 14th, my first recordings 
 I kicked it like sweet chin 
 Music on Chuck Norris 
  
 [DJ Talking] 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 Look, look, look 
 I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact 
 Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map 
 Hm, story of this eastside nigga 
 All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga 
 Where across the tracks, opposites attract 
 Niggas go hard for the color of they flag 
 Dope man money, welfare recipients 
 Unfit mothers never heard of obedience 
 Ho's so devious, niggas all talk 
 Right around the corner, deja vu 
 Same old shit, something like re-runs 
 Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ? 
 Guns in the Levis, 501s 
 Niggas don't box, they buy more guns 
 Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets 
 Don't sleep, don't sleep 
 Look, catch me sitting in my truck 
 Remy in this cup 
 No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck 
 I ride until the wheels fall off 
 That's some real shit 
 Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit 
 Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all 
 He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall 
 Fake niggas try and impersonate your character 
 That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers 
 Watch 'em! 
 My daddy told me that every day 
 Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away? 
 Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in 
 Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking 
 Damn! 
 Then reality starts to set in 
 I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding 
 I stop selling dope because niggas started telling 
 Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living 
 Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping 
 Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting 
 Stay on your job 
 Keep your eyes open on every corner 
 The blink of an eye, and you're a goner 
 No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger 
 Shock 'em like thunder 
 And the ? going bonkers 
 Just living my life up on some cool shit 
 So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit

 Poke the eye's out my beanie 
 Ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave 
 Feces shit on niggas, nigga

 Multiple of it, majority love it 
 I got the masses, meaning societies public 
 Low dickey shorts, LA fashion still holding grudges 
 Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac niggas 
 Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead 
 Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming 
 Instead, we dusted off pulled the bullet out our heads 
 Left a permanent scar, for the whole world to recognize 
 California, economics, pay your taxes bitch

 [Verse] 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree 
 Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, [bump] your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
 Pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, you know that it's big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me don't you? 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You know you're evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga 
  
 [Interlude] 
 As we proceed 
 To give you what you need 
 Trap our bodies but can't lock our minds 
 Everybody just stop 
 (The bigger I shoot) 
  
 [Hook: Assassin] 
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back 
 But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block 
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 
  
 [Interlude] 
 As we proceed 
 To give you what you need 
 Lock our body, can't trap our mind

 Uh, and when I wake up 
 I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
 But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down 
 What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life 
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
 Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight 
 Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows 
 20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me 
 Everything I know, karma comin' heavy 
 No preliminary hearings on my record 
 Tell em' other gangsters silence for the record 
 Tell the world I know it's too late 
 Boys and girls, I think I gone cray 
 Drown inside my vices all day 
 Won't you please believe when I say 
  
 [Pre-Hook] 
 Wouldn't you know 
 We been hurt, down before 
 When our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world, "Where do we go?" 
 I'm at the preacher's door 
 They wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door 
 We said give 'em some more 
 This one time, do it fo' sho 
 But we gon' be alright 
  
 [Hook] 
 We gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright (hello) 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright (P!) 
 We gon' be alright (hello) 
 We gon' be alright 
 We gon' be alright 
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 What you want, you a house, you a car? 
 Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar? 
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
 You can live at the mall 
 I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal 
 I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
 Diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal 
 Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you 
 Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you 
 In the presence of your chico... ah! 
 I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel 
 I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see 
 I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see 
 I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see 
 Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all 
 Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all 
 I rap, I'm black on track so rest assured 
 My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with... 
 God 
  
 [Part III: Untitled 5] 
  
 [Verse] 
 It's been a week already 
 Feeling weak already 
 Got me at peak, possibility of what could be 
 Situation is heavy, I've got to prove 
 On February twenty sixth I lost my life too 
 It's like I'm here in a dark dream 
 Nightmare, hear screams recorded 
 Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was 
 That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood 
 Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch? 
 And for our community do you know what this does? 
 Add to a trail of hatred 
 Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see 
 Set us back another four-hundred years 
 This is modern day slavery 
 The reason why I'm by your house 
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch 
 I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out 
 Every piece of your brain 
 'Til your son jumps into your arms 
 Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith 
 I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk 
 Had the vodka on the top 
 How come I can long time 
 How come I could make it popular? 
 Puff on what I want 
 How come I could make it popular? 
 Puff on what I want 
 See I'm living with anxiety 
 Giving up sobriety 
 Cussing with his sister 
 And playing with society 
 Justice ain't free 
 Therefore justice ain't me 
 Try and justify staying, obituary 
 Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart? 
 Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God 
 Now I'm thinking to myself 
 Hollow tips is all I got 
 Now I'm drinking by myself 
 At the end of Section Park 
 Caught you when you walk besides your house 
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch 
 I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out 
 Every piece of your brain 
 'Til your son jumps into your arms 
 The engine then sped off in a wraith 
 I said Hiiipower, one time you see it 
 Hiiipower, two times, you see it 
 Hiiipower, two times, you see it 
 Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It was eye witnessing poverty 
 Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking 
 Devour these laws trying to empower me 
 I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel 
 Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly 
 And then you caught me your pity party had towered me 
 Shower me with the will that never dried 
 I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side 
 I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried 
 She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison 
 Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual 
 Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel 
 Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I 
 Got a plan got a plan for ya 
 I just just might hold a couple bands for ya 
 And leave this message in the sand for ya 
 Tell me you’re ready to change 
 She said naw nigga it’s part of the game 
 Just like Heroin 
  
 [Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker] 
 Streets don't fail me now need you right on time 
 Say, right on time 
 Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time 
 Say, you right on time 
 Streets don't fail me now need you right on time 
 Say, you right on time 
 God, please lift the smile need you right on time 
 Say, right on time 
  
 [Post-Chorus: SZA] 
 Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill 
 Lay your head over this side, now 
 You keep pain on the inside, now 
 Whats been eating you, who's been needing you 
 You been keeping it down, and 
 You been taking me higher and higher 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch] 
 Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion 
 Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus 
 Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average 
 Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage 
 Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity 
 And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity 
 I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy 
 And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes 
 Connect the dot nigga this is fate 
 I'm talking predestination 
 I'm talking blind dedication 
 Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it 
 Sexercise a little bit of patience 
 The love of the rush is us 
 I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens 
 Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying 
 I never felt more alive than I felt dying 
 Heroin 
  
 [Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker (Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA)] 
 Streets don't fail me now need you right on time 
 Say, right on time 
 Please stay paced and ground need you right on time 
 Say, you right on time 
 Streets don't fail me now need you right on time 
 Say, you right on time 
 God please lift the smile need you right on time 
 Say, right on time 
  
 [Post-Chorus 2: Isaiah Rashad & SZA] 
 I heard you spending all your time baby (Ohhhhhh) 
 And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime) 
 At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it) 
 It's hard to come home (Hard to come home) 
 It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock &  Kendrick Lamar] 
 She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst 
 Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?) 
 She know my thoughts, pleasures, and pain 
 Everybody love her and she love everybody the same 
 She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya 
 I might hold a couple bands for ya 
 Leave a message in the sand for ya 
 Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sippin' the same 
 Nigga it's just like heroin[Verse 1] 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
 20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 20 years ago, can't forget 
 Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals 
 Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
 20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery 
 Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand 
 Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land 
 Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open 
 Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
 He begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it 
 Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 
 He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
 Nothing less, nothing more" 
 I told him I didn't have it then close my door 
 Tell me how much how much a dollar costs? 
 And this a freestyle beginning 
 And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning 
 We are the champions, we disagree 
 You can't see it then you best believe 
 This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up 
  
 [Interlude] 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't 
 And you don't, and you don't stop 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 They wanna know the question 
 K.Dot, everybody stressin' 
 This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton 
 If you come around my city you'll get stomped in 
 The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach 
 Boy, you out of reach 
 This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock 
 Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not 
 This a freestyle off the top of the dome 
 Big Boy city, you know my home 
 I'mma represent every time I come to the lab 
 If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab 
 Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets 
 You can't see us, it's TDE 
 My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in 
 Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic 
 Coming straight from Dre and Snoop 
 If you want us please jump inside the group 
 Because you don't deserve it if you don't not 
 This is straight hip hop, this is off the top 
 And when I rock you feel it 
 If it's us and then you hear it 
 Please consider that the best agree 
 The top number one emcee 
  
 [Interlude] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy 
 You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak 
 Deliver the bars that everyone agree 
 They say the number one emcee, best believe 
 I love the pianos and I love the flow 
 I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio 
 Because if I do they just might let me go 
 I'm side to the best, I ride to the best 
 I represent the West, please don't try to test 
 Because you will get disabled 
 From best of flows I know, you hate it 
 Everybody wanna rock, but they can't 
 Because they come from the street of Rosecrans [?] 
 We drop it off the top of the backboard for real 
 And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop 
 I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you 
 I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to 
 And if you know my flow then you know how it go 
 If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre 
 Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play 
 But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat 
 Because my words always compete with the best 
  
 [Interlude] 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop 
 Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg 
 D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T 
 L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play 
 Niggas and guards, projects 
 What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps 
 But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle 
 Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild 
 You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top 
 You know this hip hop, you know I cropped 
 The roof from the birth of the Earth 
 And I've been doing this since church 
 With the small slacks, with the soft suspender 
 If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya 
 We contenders, we on the top off the map 
 We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap 
 From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC 
 Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me 
 And [?] man on the beat right now 
 He gon' flip it and please believe 
 Every 16 bars is like ours 
 And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up? 
  
 [Verse 5] 
 Tonight's the night I jump off my shit 
 Deep cover on the incognito tip 
 And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip 
 I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin 
 You often looking for the best, I'm here 
 We talking, you looking for the stress, you there 
 Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here 
 You stalking the flow, you often to know 
 I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless 
 I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless 
 You spit, the words be toothless 
 But it get like that because you feel it 
 I got Rikki on my side and she chillin' 
 Big Boy on my side and he willin' 
 They say that he writing my bars, forget it 
  
 [Interlude] 
  
 [Verse 6: Big Boy] 
 It's my lyrics, it's my pen 
 It's my paper as I begin 
 I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time 
 And he's been reciting my rhymes 
 So for those out there who didn't know 
 Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow 
 Then about 10 years ago I got this call 
 From a little dude, I said "yes, yes, y'all" 
 He said "uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping" 
 I said "what's up, little homie?", he said "I wanna start trapping 
 I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio" 
 I said "slow down a little bit, bro" 
 He said "holler, I wanna rock the spot" 
 I said "what's your name?", he said "my name is K.Dot" 
 I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you 
 But this the way I wanna instill you 
 First off let me write what you gon' say 
 Record it and then press play" 
 He said "okay", it was very rude that I took K.Dot on 
 He was one of my little students 
 So he just sat in class 
 He was looking at me, said "do I get a pass? 
 Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?" 
 I said "you doing well", his head started to swell 
 Then all of a sudden he came to me 
 He said "there's this dude in Compton that has TDE" 
 I said " Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner 
 Don't stop right there because I think [?]" 
 When the dude is coming with a contract 
 But I said "hold on, let me look at that" 
 I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points 
 He want this, but don't smoke any joints 
 You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?" 
 He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen" 
 I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden 
 He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows 
 And he got poetic, he got energetic 
 Spotetic, all those -etics 
 Any more -etics, any more edits 
 Then o-etics, and then a o-etics 
 So then I came back and he was still in class 
 And then I gave em that pass 
 I said TDE, the real Macoy 
 Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy 
 And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background 
 Before I got in they had a lack sound[Intro] 
 Oh, lord, oh, lord 
 Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! (*laughs*) 
 Drizzy Drake, here we go, look 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Bitch, I'm gettin’ it how I live, I put that on my left rib 
 25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit 
 25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga 
 20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas 
 Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine 
 The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman 
 Jackets with pendants on them 
 And I got plenty war story, politic never depended on ’em 
 Uncle Sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles 
 Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal 
 Pyramids on Imperial, that's the projects 
 And I make that progress from a tedious process 
 I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster 
 Conquer, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka them casings of AK just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt 
 Shooting up the charts, muhfucka 
 See, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em 
 A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em 
 I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom 
 Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em 
 They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself 
 Hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12 
 Hennessy with the Sprite had me bouncing like Rumpelstiltskin 
 They caught me rummaging through women, I’m laughing like Elliott Wilson ( laugh ) 
 Pay me respect and pay me on my checks 
 My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts 
 You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry 
 We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue saucony 
 I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate 
 Never I’m handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k 
 As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate 
 Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say 
  
 [Outro] 
 "What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God! 
 Huh? Huh? Drizzy 
 What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"[Hook] 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Murder 101, the hottest nigga under the sun 
 I come from another planet, holdin' that cannon 
 Best believe I will dump 'til all of you vanish 
 BLAW one to the throat, you ain't livin' no mo' 
 Now you know I go, harder than most 
 I'm on that pimpin' shit, take your bitch, guard your ho 
 And I don't give a shit, if I hit, long as she blow 
 Just as much as a ref does a whistle 
 I got dimes, just multiply two nickles 
 From Lisa's to Keisha's down to Nicole's 
 Got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul 
 Y'all niggas should already know, I got hoes boy 
 But you already know that, pimpin' 
 A baller slash killer like O.J. Simpson 
 Close to the mic like Scottie Pippen 
 Superglue grip, I ain't ever slippin' 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And I move with the coupe through traffic 
 Real talk, homeboy, not just rappin' 
 With the tool, mami know that I practice 
 Cause when I pull it out, I be shootin' it backwards 
 She like "Damn, how you do that stuff?" 
 I said "Don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho' 
 Aye [?], they better act like they know what's up 
 Before I send 'em to the Heaven, let 'em know what's up 
 Oh yeah, I'm what people need 
 And I'm out of y'alls speed cause the flow got gas 
 Yeah, our shit be the bomb 
 My suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer 
 I'm goin' down as the minor of the year 
 Seventeen, fresh to death, clean, diamonds in my ear 
 Play with me, have them triple beams aimin' at your rear 
 Honestly, I'm the mothafucka that niggas fear 
  
 [Hook] 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, cause that's my 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, that's my 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Dave, man, put them niggas in the grave, man 
 Fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the K, man 
 I'm still gettin' that cake, man 
 Cause my uncle's still pitchin' rocks like a caveman 
 You snakes, stay far from my home 
 Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on 
 Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit 
 Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet 
 You wanna witness the livest nigga existin' 
 Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission 
 I'm on my mission to conquer my competition 
 My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe 
 I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me 
 Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty 
 Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy 
 Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me 
 She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty 
 Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply 
  
 [Hook] 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave 
 Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave

 Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken 
 Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick] 
 Yo, yo 
 Before I commit suicide 
 I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide 
 Walk up on 'em, circle the block 
 Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot 
 This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms 
 Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang! 
 One man Vietnam 
 .45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa 
 On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades 
 Head doctor, knee pads 
 Gave it to her out of courtesy 
 Curtains close on that Maybach 
 Lay back as I hop on my underground shit 
 Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black 
 True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers 
 Hustle in front of corner stores 
 Street catered, for been living on minimum wages 
 It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor 
 With suicide 
  
 [Hook] 
 Before I commit suicide 
 Before I commit suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick] 
 You a liar, you and I are not alike 
 I flow like water, purify mics 
 Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones 
 Or anyone sitting on the throne 
 Don't get your career postponed 
 Women, children, I rode past in traffic 
 Can't steer, cars crash 
 I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list 
 I wrap rappers on stretchers 
 Guns clap in the direction your sepsis 
 No matter your gender, not sexist 
 You MC? You better surrender 
 I love breakfast, lunch and dinner 
 Killing these rappers 
 Sparring in the winter, training in the summer 
 More practice, let's continue 
 Doing numbers like an accountant 
 You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting 
 You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise 
 And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life 
  
 [Hook] 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
  
 [Bridge] 
 (Oh, you motherfuckers think I'm playing, huh? Let me hop on my Daddy Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'Naw mean?) 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick] 
 I delete MCs under concrete 
 Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me 
 A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed 
 One shot to the heart, one more to the head 
 My rhymes so clever I never fall off 
 From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off 
 But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi 
 Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B 
 Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols 
 Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual 
 But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all 
 And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball 
 The B-board, those will die who decoy 
 Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise 
 It's K-Dot, the terminator 
 Fake rapper rhyme slayer 
 Those who live now will die later 
  
 [Outro] 
 The suicide[Intro] 
 Uh, oh, y'all know what it is 
 Uh, it's that Compton -ish 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, (yeah) 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, (right) 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, (ad lib) 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, (let's go) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm back at it again 
 My city back at it with ‘em 
 Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin 
 But they can fuck with that pen 
 The shit I write is brighter than blue gems 
 You better stay in that gym 
 Exercise your mind till it's strong enough 
 To fuck with mine 
 Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em 
 I'm black with thoughts of Einstein 
 One word describing him, genius 
 What you know about the city I'm living 
 With the souls of the dead is livin' 
 You don't know about our living conditions 
 We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion 
 But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers 
 Bullet collisions, players , pimps 
 Who can envision the place where I reside 
 Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting 
 NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin' 
 The first ones to say fuck the system 
 I'm tryin to tell you about 
  
 [Hook] 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Geah, his own street like concrete 
 Would best describe fit his gutter 
 But see I'm what's underneath 
 A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef 
 I'm from the land of organized crime 
 Disorderly peace 
 ‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece 
 And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs 
 The Compton shares can't forget the police 
 ‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more 
 It be the mark of the beast 
 And their main aim is just the talk of the streets 
 But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet 
 That they go , watch em!? 
 Had you for road kill just like a possum 
 You could contain ‘em 
 But there's no way that you can stop ‘em 
 Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas 
 Hoping one day they blossom 
 The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em 
 ‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em 
 Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem 
 From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial 
 We back that's for my people it's official 
  
 [Hook] 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life 
 Chevy lights, women you like 
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life 
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights 
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I don't know if he new around here 
 Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here 
 ‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here 
 Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here 
 Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care 
 It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear 
 The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day 
 But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years 
 I seen niggas shed blood blood tears 
 Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you 
 Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters 
 Introduce you to rugers 
 Clock you in like Tap Judah 
 A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live 
 Minus the actress and the producers 
 Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper 
 We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to 
 From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia 
 We back that's for my people it's official

 When I get up all in ya 
 Tell your girlfriend I beat it up 
 So she can tell her friend I beat it up 
 So I can get some fame, about my pipe game

 Wee wee wee (that’s funny to me) 
 Like a pornstar 
 Wee wee wee 
 Wee wee wee 
 Wee wee wee 
 Now they know who I are 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I was in high school 
 Met this little bad bitch 
 She had all the Jordan shoes 
 Hair in a ponytail 
 Earrings bamboo 
 I said no disrespect 
 Girl I want a sample 
 She said, “You don’t know me yet” 
 I said, “What that got to do with it” 
 One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it 
 Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker 
 Now let your guard down 
 I just wanna fuck you 
 I’m hard right now 
 I put that on me 
 She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity" 
 Well you know curiosity killed the cat 
 So as we walk home from school show me where you live at 
 Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that 
 Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that 
 Hm hm 
 Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him 
 Preach 
  
 [Hook] 
 When I get up all in ya 
 Tell your girlfriend I beat it up 
 So she can tell her friend I beat it up 
 So I can get some fame, about my pipe game 
 And slang my wee wee wee

 Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul 
 Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa 
 Them were the good old days but now a nigga older 
 I think back of when I chased that cat 
 Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all 
 Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all 
 No holds barred I would go so hard 
 Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed 
 Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass 
 I made her laugh 
 Maybe walk her home 
 Maybe get some dome 
 Like Super Bowl Sunday 
 And then I’m gone 
 Off to the next 
 Call her on the phone 
 This was before text 
 Carson High we was on them chicks” 
 Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix 
 That’s a flip if you didn’t know 
 Let the homie hit though 
 Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in 
  
 [Outro] 
 Wee wee wee 
 Wee wee wee 
 Wee wee wee[Intro] 
 I welcome y'all to boot camp 
 Training Day 
 Fasten your seatbelts 
  
 [Verse] 
 Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor 
 Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you 
 Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra 
 Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya 
 Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya 
 Through my vision like perennial 
 Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe 
 The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane 
 One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans 
 Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient 
 Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted 
 Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links 
 Put 'em in the basement 
 BET, I'm strapped with TNT 
 Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh 
 That's what they say when they see me in your coupe 
 Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop 
 You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot" 
 Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot" 
 Get out the way, label, and try to make it to safety 
 Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety 
 Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes 
 Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe 
 That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers 
 I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker 
 I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers 
 You want it? They could serve you, butler 
 Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover 
 So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you" 
 You're better off looking for your next sucker 
 Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker 
 I ball as if I play for the Rucker 
 Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya 
 He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real 
 Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster 
 If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta 
 And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta 
 In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya 
 I keep it street from Compton to Russia 
 Rhyme technique is something like none other 
 It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers 
 I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas 
 Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger 
 And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young 
 Please move in orderly fashion 
 For the love of money and crime I got a passion 
 Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin' 
 Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson 
 Any one, pick one 
  
 [Outro] 
 Aye 
 I told you we gonna send you niggas to boot camp 
 Training Day 
 Fasten your seatbelts 
 The ride is rough 
 Lace your boots too 
 This is practice right here, we do this shit in our sleep 
 Yeah[Intro] 
 God feel me 
 God feel me 
 Ride low 
 Feel me 
 Feel me 
 Weezy-F where you at? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look, A straight up Compton nigga til Im 6 feet 
 Like Iverson be 
 Ride and die for mines 
 Its just me 
 No side on mines 
 Because I don’t need niggas switching sides on mines 
 Childhood friends become enemies 
 Don’t pay’em no mind 
 Do your mind like they did Kennedy's 
 Closed casket 
 Ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket 
 High shore taxes 
 High by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest 
 So he tote llamas middle finger to ya 
 I never fuck hoes with no condom 
 Not a high school graduate 
 Hustlin is where his passion is 
 Hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it 
 Hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it 
 Where da cash, where da safe? 
 A robbery’s taking place 
 Give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him 
 You can almost see his adrenaline pumping 
 Hey young world we are the children 
  
 [Hook] 
 It’s a young boys world out here 
 We gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know 
 It’s a young boys world out here 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I swear to god you gotta feel me 
 Look..standin on the corner with crack rocks and marijuana 
 Burner glue, dough and I’m duckin police 
 In California state penitentiary livin 
 Feelin like the whole fuckin world don’t love him 
 So fuck yall 
 Keep thuggin til the casket drops 
 Gangsta down to the socks 
 Wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not 
 Just look at his position and the city he live in 
 Bang the hood like a head on car collision 
 Bang his tool like a mechanic up under the engine 
 Knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business 
 Cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness 
 Don’t call the lieutenant miss Parker he meant it 
 I’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid 
 See to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas 
 I do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system 
 Jason head hold ya head 
 Jewel keep written sentences 
 Maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise 
 And a reminder every time you walk outside 
  
 [Hook] 
 Feel Me, feel Me 
 Real Talk, what's up 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Look, my nigga just had a daughter 
 Only way to feed his daughter 
 Said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up 
 Tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow 
 Back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him 
 For that mission again on they mission again 
 Pop another blue pill then feel relentless again 
 Waking up in cold sweats see the image again 
 Nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him 
 Plus his people keep telling him use your common sense 
 So he tell’em retaliation is commencing 
 That’s all they know as a Compton kid 
 Living only for the moment fuck a consequence 
 His accomplishments lies deep within 
 The black heart that hoes be hatin violence 
 Use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant 
 I’m the voice of hell that we livin' in 
 So when the devil got they tongue, I be speakin' for them 
 Talk to me, [Hook] talk to me 
  
 I’m the voice of hell that we be livin 
 So when the devil got they tongue I be speakin for them 
 Yung boys 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 It’s a young boy's world out here 
 I said I'm out here baby I said I’m out here baby 
 If you livin in this life blessed one day at a time 
 It's your world young boy you can heal or destroy 
 Make it wrong or make it right 
 It's your world you decide 
 Said it's yours young boy 
 Said it's yours young boy 
 Oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya babyOn Macklemore winning best rap album 
  
 It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go. 
  
  
 On the Grammys snubbing him entirely 
  
 I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

 I'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown 
 Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb 
 So swiftly, come get me 
 If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me 
 I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up 
 I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50 
 Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins 
 So where I move, it's comin' with me 
 You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life 
 The scope'll have more dots on you than a website 
 I'm 'bout my head right and yours left 
 I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath 
 That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot 
 With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch 
 You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks 
 Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial

 Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out 
 As the day go I let the beat rock 
 Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops 
 God Father plant the seed, you should be my son 
 And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun 
 I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning 
 Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous 
 I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman 
 So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant 
 I’m always performing 
 Like it’s my last morning 
 Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning 
 I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans 
 Ground level never been important when I walk the earth 
 Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time 
 Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines 
 Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions 
 That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme… 
 Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
  
 Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that 
 My town I rep it till im off this map 
 Watts City, Eastside baby 
 Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty 
 It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural 
 Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasn't sworn in it 
 I ain't a millennium baby,look I was born in it 
 Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line 
 I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write 
 Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear 
 You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock! 
  
 [Verse 3: Microphone Tone] 
 Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East 
 Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat 
 A natural beat 
 Got me like a savage and beast 
 The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast 
 I'm back in this piece 
 So listen when the package complete 
 Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released 
 The passion in me 
 Got me spittin' accurately 
 So the realest MC is what I happen to be 
 You can vibe wit it or move back 
 These new jacks gettin blue black 
 With boom bap I proved that 
 Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that 
 On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit 
 Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship 
 It's intricate now go and start the sirens 
 My microphone's on the flow is sparking violence 
 We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus AllenHey homeboy, what you know bout them local house parties? 
 Posted right next to the hennessy 
 We do the same old dance over here 
 We like.. 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
  
 [Verse 1] 
  
 Hold up homie, you ain't known around here to roll up homie 
 Might get your face swollen up homie 
 Don't, run up run up you know I got the kodak on me 
 I load up like U-Haul trucks, YUP 
 Don't get your whole crew stuck 
 In a position that they can't get out 
 We lay em out like Ricky on that plastic couch 
 And Q can save you, know of the scholarship they gave you, OUCH 
 Don't you know we ain't going for the okie doke 
 West Coast New Edition, Biv Devoe 
 Baby bib around your neck niggas, I feed you with the better flow 
 Hit the flo' when we shootin, ruin house parties 
 There's too many black bodies in one place equals a fuck up 
 Somehow some way, its fucked up ain't it 
 But we ain't lookin for the drama today 
 We tucked the hammers in the hoodies to come and put him away 
 Now everbody 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
 Poke ya elbows out and swang like this 
 Whatever you wanna call it 
 For the weed heads and for the alcoholics 
 Now this could be some OG lowrider music 
 Or you can twist your fingers up and gang bang to it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
  
 I got some ese homies that so loco 
 They be off that wet 
 They be hanging out thugging, they be banging sets 
 They be hanging out, sagging everywhere Im at 
 I ain't gon lie about it 
 Got your car at the light, we gon crowd around it 
 Think you a baller huh? 
 Think you a flosser huh? 
 Well you should know that the chain gotta come off ya huh 
 Before they put it to ya brain gotta off ya huh 
 He got it for ya, what you want? 
 Weed, wet, white, E pills, syrup 
 Where the chronic at? Let it burn up 
 Let it burn till the Lord come 
 Let the Monic spokes turn till they can't turn no mo' 
 Till the neighborhood watch ain't concerned no mo' 
 I let the neighborhood watch when I open the trunk 
 A car show is what they got and everybody go 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
  
 What you know about that California lifestyle? 
 [Problem seeds spitting on the ground follow me?] 
 Im giving you a walkthrough of the block and down the street 
 Los Angeles scan less, police Cutlass and Caprice 
 And problems with scrapers underneath 
 Lollipops and bad bitches runnin in flocks soon as the car stop 
 As soon as the beat drop 
 When it come back on I bet the whole city rock 
 Word to Jay Rock 
 I told you that Im focused mane 
 I do my dance I know that you notice mane 
 And I rep, I rep like Im supposed to mane 
 Top Dawg ENT, we some soldiers mane 
 And the coldest thang about it, no swag right now I do it without it 
 Now let me put it on 
 You should move this way soon as she hear the song 
 Don't wanna see no elbows straight 
 Everybody just 
  
 [Hook]Ay, in my apartment a long time ago 
 I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow 
 Still gave it up when it's a few of us 
 She let me finger fuck her on the school bus 
 We used to cut school with her and run train 
 She want to hang with us, we want one thing 
 Just penetrating that throat dog 
 She choke on it like Smoke Dog 
 But whenever I fucked up my re-up 
 In a dice game I go see her 
 She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce 
 And then blow a blunt of that reefa' 
 She used to buy a nigga new sneakers 
 Pay the bill on my beeper 
 Just so she can pay to put a "69" 
 And I know what time to go freak her 
 Then one day I just asked her 
 "Why you always give your ass up? 
 I mean damn these hoes get paid 
 All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up." 
 She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love 
 Even if I know it ain't real love 
 Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it 
 Then never call back, I still fuck" 
 And that's fucked up, she's so trill 
 I need somethin', she go steal 
 When the trap hot and police ride 
 Nigga, guess where we go chill? 
 For 'bout four years she held dope 
 And my four pounds till' it goes down 
 I remember shawty, she stayed down 
 I won't say her name because she married now 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 She would always turn heads when she'd fall through 
 She would always make moves how a boss do 
 And she never gave any nigga time of day 
 But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to 
 But when it came to me, she had a thing for me 
 When we kick it she roll up the weed for me 
 And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady 
 Watching just to see if the police coming 
 We got close over time, her and I 
 Right around the time that I first got signed 
 Come to think about it I was 'bout 17 
 I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive 
 I was going back and forth with these flights 
 Another show after show, each night 
 She became so suspicious of these other bitches 
 She'd go through my phone and we'd fight 
 Talk about torn between the two 
 Wasn't really much more that we could do 
 Wasn't really much space for us 
 But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do 
 But I guess one night I had a few 
 Huh, one night I had a few 
 Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye 
 I told her "hurry up, meet me at the room" 
 And no, I didn't have a contraceptive 
 And my common sense neglected 
 And two months later next thing I know 
 I got a text that said "I'm pregnant" 
 And you can almost bet she kept it 
 That's the reason why you left me 
 On top of all that, it wasn't even mine 
 I went and got paternity tested, damn! 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Wait, hold up, is that you? 
 With them big ol' thighs after school? 
 Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five 
 When I said I'm in hot pursuit 
 You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive 
 A new Monte Carlo that cruise 
 And that shot my pride, I tried to improv' 
 But no freestyle I never do 
 You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti 
 You overlooking every nigga that ain't quite ready 
 To make it rain on you like about to break a levee 
 Hold up, that pussy petty 
 Yeah, your nails did, your hair did 
 Your cell phone is selfish 
 It only got numbers that come with a Hummer 
 Her new prima donna I smelt it 
 Tried to make you mine, ho! 
 Tried to make some time, ho! 
 But I ain't got the time or the patience 
 To stop and wait in line, ho! 
 Her dreams holds Versace 
 She fall for Armani 
 Only deal with rich niggas 
 Fuck you and Mitt Romney 
 I'm grown now I'm on my own now 
 I'm po'ppin' 
 Change my phone now 
 When I get home now 
 I got o'ptions 
 Fast forward, wait is that you? 
 With them big old thighs after school? 
 And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies 
 And car note that's overdue? I know 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Bear witness 
 Watch me get it in like underage club attendants 
 The roof go back like it's vintage 
 The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn 
 What's God willing when HOVA retired? 
 Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands 
 Who is that? I...am... 
 K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas 
 You can't categorize me 
 I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out 
 Any comments? I thought so 
 You niggas is gassed up like ALCO 
 Scared to play Madden on All-Pro 
 Step your game up 
 I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes 
 SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!) 
 I take 99.9% of your fans 
 The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...) 
 Ain't nothing gifted about you 
 Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you 
 I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food 
 Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes 
 I don't wait on you rap dudes 
 Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude 
 Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne... 
 Is it? Are you? 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My real niggas, once again it's on 
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb 
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done 
 My city blow them horns, it sounds like... 
 WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! 
 When they blow dem horns I'm coming 
 Torch in hand, yes, I'm running 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I told you Rock, I like red too 
 But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue 
 They don't see it coming 
 Who ain't a part of the family tree 
 Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him 
 We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us 
 Sip Henny 'til my throat drown 
 New Benz, No Malice 
 Count money 'til our hands get calloused 
 40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los 
 Angeles, you might leave with bandages 
 Real life, no mannequin 
 You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot 
 Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops 
 I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits 
 No magician, no magic, POOF 
 Closed casket fatal attraction 
 Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bullshitting 
 Them veterans been loved 'em 
 Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em 
 And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao 
 No man get the best of him 
  
 [Verse 3: Punch] 
 The way I see, why rap? 
 I'm just wasting my breath 
 Y'all don't hear me 
 I'm just chasing my death 
 It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps 
 Try not to recollect what I know 
 These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen 
 Be the reason my heart's bleeding 
 I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms 
 Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom 
 The application of your knowledge is me 
 Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree 
 Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet 
 When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it 
 I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get 
 For trying to test my patience like nurses 
 This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse 
 Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 My real niggas, once again it's on 
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb 
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done 
 My city blow them horns, it sounds like... 
 WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! 
 When they blow dem horns I'm coming 
 Torch in hand, yes, I'm running 
 My real niggas, once again it's on 
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb 
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done 
 My city blow them horns, it sounds like... 
 WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! 
 When they blow dem horns I'm coming 
 Torch in hand, yes, I'm running[Verse 1:] 
  
 Tell 'em, ok 
 Tell 'em I got plenty hustle to sell 'em 
 Heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom 
 Lead how right to light ignite my cerebellum 
 Close to the pen like I had three felons 
 Come from a city where niggas show no remorse 
 And the corpse is just another homie taking this course 
 Of course my dream was to play in the final four 
 Til the twelve grade came and I was only five four 
 So Now I’m a graduate, looking to get higher 
 My pops knew a security job, he inquired 
 But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told 
 I stop, drop the role when somebody else fired 
 Now there goes another black boy unemployed with a lot of free time 
 Which means he’s hungry or just a lot of free crime 
 I lived it in my rhymes, and when I hit the porch, this is what I realize 
 Wassup[Hook: Lady Gaga] 
 Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy 
 It's a test of your stamina, do your best 
 Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy 
 Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man 
 Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand 
 Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary 
 Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury 
 Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen 
 So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam 
 I see red flag, I see blue flag 
 I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass 
 You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad 
 I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad' 
 And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard 
 See, we been down for too long 
 Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong 
 If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man 
 Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ah, this for the hatred in you 
 This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you 
 This is for the early coffins of those discriminated 
 Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye 
 And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption 
 That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite 
 I'll still run with pleasure 
 Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil 
 Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang 
  
 [Bridge: Lady Gaga] 
 Prepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga 
 We partynauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya 
 Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar 
 We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya 
  
 [Hook]I don't need the hype 
 They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction 
 No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing 
 You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton 
 Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac 
 I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys 
 Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot 
 Cause your homey said you you was a few times 
 Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie 
 The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it 
 Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up 
 I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs 
 I threw away the key 
 My cool is on, she love my A/C 
 My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me 
 I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys 
 I push the coupe like a high speed 
 The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me 
 Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom 
 This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back 
 Finally the finest of 'em all is back 
 To define the laws of crack 
 Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK 
 You're nothing more than a little John phrase 
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime 
 Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft 
 Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft 
 You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad 
 Just inspiration: something you never had 
 If my pockets is something you trying to grab 
 I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab 
 You old news, you old dudes get out of my way 
 Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age 
 I'm on a mission for pay 
 And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space 
 You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here 
 But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz 
 The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his" 
 No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids 
 Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water 
 Do he really fuck with President Carter? 
 My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses 
 Had the bidding war popping like an auction 
 Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more? 
 Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch 
 But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it 
 Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with? 
 Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit 
 Teamed up with Watt's finest 
 Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em? 
 (Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em) 
 Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas 
 I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga 
 But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up 
 I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups 
 Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F 
 Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA 
 I raise the bar for rapping the West 
 So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West 
 Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect 
 So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls 
 And the Raider caps, my khakis on 
 Address the issue in my last three songs 
 Man, Game know about you West Coast clones 
 And nigga we hate twins 
 Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know 
 I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4 
 That's number one, cause second is the first loser 
 Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future 
 Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right 
 But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight 
 Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight 
 I'm trying to get money like the Oasis 
 If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling 
 I keep rolling, never stop 
 Top Dawg Entertainment: Presents K-Dot[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I love money, I love bitches for the lack of better words 
 Ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings for the lack of better words 
 I miss your call four time this evening for the lack of better words 
 The music loud, can't hear it ringing for the lack of better words 
  
 [Verse 2: SZA] 
 You got nothing left to offer but a lack of better words 
 Get nothing else from me but a lack of better words 
 Had a nickel every time you get a lack of better words 
 Feeling cheap to be your woman for the lack of better words 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 But I say my ego gotta yeet for the lack of better words 
 I can't love you, I love these streets for the lack of better words 
 But if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse 
 I'm selfish, I can't help it, for the lack of better words 
  
 [Verse 4: SZA] 
 You gon' be like this forever for the lack of better words 
 You gon' get your shit together, no, no you never learn 
 You cannot do better for the lack of better words 
 Never can let you forget it any time you on my nerves 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Na, na, na, all you do, make excuse 
 Na, na, na, all you do, is make excuse 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 (Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy) 
 I wish a nigga would (ah!) 
 I wish this nigga (uh!) 
 I wish a nigga would 
 I wish this nigga (yeah!) 
 I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh 
 I wish this nigga (uh!) 
 I wish a nigga would 
 I wish a nigga (yeah!) 
 Stuck in a rock and a hard place [inaudible] 
 God damn, bitch, hoe, huh 
 Yeah, woah[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Once again it's on 
 I'm the youngest in charge, I am not playin' 
 I fear no man else than God 
 Scatter your features, give you a face collage 
 Not one, but two, I face menage 
 No hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage 
 General, you can call me the sargeant 
 $7.45, five percent tip 
 I know I'm the shit, please hold the applaud 
 I spent summers writin' rhymes, winters freestylin' 
 Daydreamin' Gilligan thoughts on an island 
 I didn't develop, I was born with this talent 
 Brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge 
 I need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit 
 Stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead 
 But still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head 
 Preach, listen how I pledge 
 I've been gettin' this money since you dummies were peein' in bed 
 To poppin' wheelies on handlebars and pegs 
 To poppin' Big Willy at the bar with bread 
 Pause, it's real talk, I know you gotta crawl before you walk 
 Shit, I decided to jog 
 I'm ten brains better than y'all 
 Propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak 
 I fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet 
 You 'bout to fitness a lyrical fitness 
 This is what it'd sound like if God spoke over beats 
 I cash in my rap friends 
 Peep the way I deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps 
 I consider that they learn from me 
 This is volcano hot, fuck a third degree 
 Burn, You gotta be K-D-O-T 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Once again it's on, I am through with niggas 
 Twin Glocks, it'll shoot niggas 
 Put you next to a plant, under a root nigga 
 Hands folded together up in a suit nigga 
 This what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas 
 Matter of fact, I recruit niggas 
  
 [Verse 3: Bill Thrill] 
 Bill Thrill straight spook niggas 
 Sixteens that'll ruin niggas 
 You mad cause I'm gettin' figures 
 I'm the bigger picture, you losin' dough and mine's gettin' thicker 
 I got somethin' that'll sting yah I call it the pinch hitter 
 Gather your mans so they can die with yah 
 Bill and K-Dot, now y'all dealin' with the best (right) 
 Side by side, yeah we somethin' like breasts 
 Flow game killin', I spit bars of death 
 Now they yellin' could it get any worse 
 [?] definition of Hell on Earth 
 Keep somethin' on the side, yeah you know that work 
 One false move, it'll make your whole body jerk 
 Think before you cross this turf 
 You'll get turned into ashes, or even laid in the dirt[Chorus] 
 You can own this city 
 You have everything you need 
 All it takes is all you got 
 Life don't ask you if you're ready or not 
 You can own this city 
 Deep inside you hold the key 
 While the world is fast asleep 
 You can take it all if you just dare to dream 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Talk about goals 
 Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house 
 With a permanent flow 
 Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch 
 And the couch is cold 
 And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole 
 And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove 
 And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool 
 With a big room and a closet, cause it 
 Hurt when you laughing at his clothes 
 Looking at him like he ain't shit 
 Forever living in that commode 
 Time flies and I watch it tick 
 Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk 
 Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note 
 Tripod then I aim it at your soul 
 For bright lights 
 Bite like a alligator when I write 
 Hungry, come see determination upon me 
 Come see the visionary in my sight 
 My life premeditated by ambition 
 Pistons from my Nikes take off 
 No assistance, I'm persistent 
 Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You can own this city 
 You have everything you need 
 All it takes is all you got 
 Life don't ask you if you're ready or not 
 You can own this city 
 Deep inside you hold the key 
 While the world is fast asleep 
 You can take it all if you just dare to dream 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Let's talk about pressure 
 Let's talk about depression 
 Let's talk about desperate 
 Times 
 Everyday I'm guessin' 
 My mind, It'll never end up resting 
 I climb a ladder every second 
 I find another mountain top 
 Another video I watch when that video go off 
 I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand 
 Soldiers never could war off my talents 
 I wanna reassure my talents 
 I wipe my face but never throw my towel in 
 I'm often prowlin' 
 The edge of a quantum jump in my head 
 I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth 
 And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights 
 Bite like a bear trap when I write 
 Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder 
 I took it off and ate it 
 I made it a full meal 
 And I'm still craving, my front teeth 
 I sink in the rap game 
 My name will attract fame 
 My veins got the blood of a king in it 
 When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say 
 "Kendrick" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You can own this city 
 You have everything you need 
 All it takes is all you got 
 Life don't ask you if you're ready or not 
 You can own this city 
 Deep inside you hold the key 
 While the world is fast asleep 
 You can take it all if you just dare to dream 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So what you gonna do? 
 What you gonna do? 
 You can run, you can hide 
 But when you are chosen 
 The walls they close in 
 Your forefathers look you in your eyes 
 So what you gonna do? 
 What you gonna do? 
 You can run, you can hide 
 But when you are chosen 
 The walls they close in 
 Your forefathers look you in your eyes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You can own this city 
 You have everything you need 
 All it takes is all you got 
 Life don't ask you if you're ready or not 
 You can own this city 
 Deep inside you hold the key 
 While the world is fast asleep 
 You can take it all if you just dare to dream[Intro] 
 Uh, yeah 
 Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh 
  
 [Verse] 
 I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be 
 The realest shit, I must admit, I'm basking in my feces 
 My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji 
 The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the 
 Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills 
 No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill 
 Houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us 
 Where exes think it's buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings 
 I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major 
 Composer like I'm Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus 
 Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain 
 The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes 
 Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC 
 I don't smoke with homies though, find a cloud then have a seat 
 Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80 
 I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes 
 'Knahmean? 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 And guess what? 
 I need all of mine's—mo' paper, mo' dough 
 I need all of mine's—more pussy, more hoes 
 I-I need all of mine's—and yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing 
 Nigga 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Just ride, don't ask where we going (ay) 
 Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing (ay) 
 Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control and 
 Give you what you need and give you what you want in life 
  
 [Outro] 
 I need all of mine's 
 I need all of mine's 
 I-I need all of mine's 
 Just ride, don't ask where we going 
 Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing 
 Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control 
 Give you what you need and give you what you want in life[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]

 Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up 
 Then my niggas squad up 
 If you got trees fire it up, fire it up 
  
 [Verse 1: Freeway] 
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas 
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs 
 Free packed intro, tech with a muffler 
 Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee 
 He's making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools 
 The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones 
 The hair and bones 
 To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game 
 To get us, they get tucked 
 Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up 
 It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews 
 Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck 
 Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home 
 You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you 
 They got it in for us, but they ain't bending us 
 We got a infra strong enough to flip a code 
  
 [Hook] 
 Niggas want beef ride up 
 Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up 
 Then my niggas squad up 
 If you got trees fire it up, fire it up 
  
 [Verse 2: Joe Budden] 
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas 
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs 
 Cops trying to cease my beans 
 No nice clothes were caught in the morning 
 Trying to crease my jeans 
 I remember me as a young buck 
 Trying to put work in 
 Same pants for two weeks 
 But I would iron the dirtiness real 
 Back then the battle was urgent 
 Now days you see me in the same shit 
 I didn't have the detergent 
 I'm riding Six and Park 
 You used thought you knew like the back of your hand 
 Turn around and give the glove 
 So I learn to stay with you 
 Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2 
 It'll turn your man into a hater, true 
 Hopefully the pain will stay past then 
 As what's to come, it's better that what has been 
 Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem' 
 Joey and Freeway, still hood, still starving, nigga 
  
 [Hook] 
 Niggas want beef ride up 
 Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas 
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs 
 My big Unc still fucking with customers 
 Greyhound not in town, moving them keys 
 Hoopty or V12, I'm moving them keys 
 Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease 
 Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese 
 That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when 'ya sleep 
 It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit 
 Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips 
 Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket 
 It's real 
 Goddamn there's no man like I am, that capables the skills of a genius 
 I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger 
 A new nightmare, I'm right there 
 With the head of Lucifer killing you demons 
 God's children, what can you do to us? 
 This rap shit ain't new to us 
 Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us 
 Y'all better get used to us, I'm my own scout nigga 
 How you recruiting us? 
 Heh, I call your bluff, they said stop 
 But then the people said it wasn't enough, nigga 
  
 [Outro: Freeway & Kendrick Lamar] 
 Niggas want beef ride up

 Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we 
 Coming back in a week, and the weak good 
 Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride 
 Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a 
 Kind like great antiques museums buy 
 Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit 
 But booya click booya click, click 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune 
 The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions 
 And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus 
 So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem 
 Diamond in the rough 
 Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up 
 Book em down! Fuck is up? 
 Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme 
 A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light 
 I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist 
 Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two 
 Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits 
 Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue 
 A tiger on Central 
 Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me 
 More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we.. 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow 
 Tip full clip 
 Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really 
 Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse? 
 Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out 
 That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you 
 Probably would go blind 
 I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball 
 Through a straw, that make you tell your mom 
 I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear 
 My cousins hand-me-downs 
 Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get 
 The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost 
 Bitten gloves cause 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar][Verse] 
 Livin' in my own world, I could never die 
 Ambition of a hundred kings livin' in the sky 
 Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me 
 My destiny tellin' me that God got me 
 Grace in my own greatness and I made this 
 Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it 
 Set me free, I wanna be set free 
 I wanna be remembered in my own legacy 
  
 [Hook] 
 We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings 
 We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed 
 You recognize this more than just my dream 
 Once you realize, you'll know what lies beneath 
 Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath 
 Close your eyes and you'll realize you know what lies beneath 
  
 [Verse] 
 Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me 
 My destiny tellin' me that God got me 
 Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness 
 Back when I said that I tried my hardest 
 I will not lose, I paid my dues 
 I failed several times, I tied my shoes[Intro] 
 Classic, Young Gotti 
 Gangsta, gangsta 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick 
 Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit 
 I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick 
 Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch 
 I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up 
 Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama 
 No condom, it's good pussy 
 Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer 
 Took me too many moons set up this new platoon 
 Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom 
 Man look, your man, look like sweet water 
 Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up 
 Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk 
 And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off 
 I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave 
 Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa 
 Tell em put my name on the blimp 
 Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym 
 You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels 
 And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul 
 I'm in the crowd like Artest and them 
 I move the crowd like Artest and them 
 Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians 
 Crunch time mean I take it to the hole 
 Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in 
 I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in 
 Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck 
 They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin 
 I need to clear it with the bank just to win 
 Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit 
 It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner 
 Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner 
 Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda 
 I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a 
 Motherfucker would get your whole career injured 
 This assault what a deadly weapon 
 Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record 
 We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing 
 Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive 
 I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing 
 That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence 
 A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments 
 15 minutes come up with 60 seconds 
 Last month I've been six hours inside of session 
 Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing 
 Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up 
 Still be a millionaire 
 You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear 
 Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear 
 Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack.. 
 Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy 
  
 Alright 
 And you don't stop, and it don't stop 
 And you don't stop 
 And it don't stop 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't 
 And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick 
 And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich 
 Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips 
 Climbup the tree shit on you 
 Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle 
 Hastle and breaking your picket fence 
 I know pterodactyls that still exist 
 Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go.. 
 You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist 
 We can taste it from planet pluto 
 Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos 
 Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more 
 Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho 
 I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker 
 Trace your..with no the ..coach 
 Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops 
 Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up? 
  
 Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop

 And if we had it once then we got it right back 
 And if you ever had it you won't have it no more 
 And if we see the back though we to the front door 
 Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head 
 This is freestyle of the top of the dome 
 And you know Big Boi that's my home 
 What's up? 
  
 And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop 
 And you do, and you do, and you do and you do 
 And you do, and you do, and you do and you do 
 And you do, and you do, and you do and you do 
 And you do, and you do, and you do stop[Intro] 
 Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower 
 Me and my niggas 
 3 eyes to my alumni 
 I wanna hear, turn me up 
 Turn me up a little bit more 
 My nigga Cole in this motherfucker, sup nigga 
 There we go yeah, turn me up 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Picture plenty pussies throwing pelly guns at me 
 Paranoia making it more than difficult for me to sleep 
 Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got 
 But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip hop 
 So retaliation is a must 
 When we bend the block, my niggas dumping out the roof 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Me, K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit 
 Walk inside the label, struck a match, then I blew 
 C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere 
 I got three hoes with me, it smells like Dior and derrière 
 Decoy Dodge slow, you can detour to Heaven’s stair 
 Walking inside Hell’s dungeons, I just might derail something 
 They pussies, I smell something 
 You dush on the daily niggas, you push on them daisies 
 I push on gas on the Mercedes, nigga 
 Came in this game with a Rolie chain and a dream 
 Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream 
  
 [Hook] 
 And now we dumping out the roof 
 Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too 
 Me, K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit 
 Walk inside the label, struck a match, then I blew 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nigga that thought Good Kid might flop, or that I might go pop 
 Or your bitch won’t drop, knees when my shit drop 
 You’re too infatuated by the fucking numbers 
 Should make it easy for me to divide and conquer 
 I come from Compton, we ain’t have it all 
 Smoke a space inside the cafeteria hall 
 And I’m putting fear in you all 
 See your skeletons shaking 
 Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby unti you naked 
 Y’all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs 
 I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne 
 If not J.Cole, your shit is trash 
 But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh 
 This is where we at? I guess it’s entertainment 
 I guess this is speculation making a classic king with 
 If I ain’t have the patience I’d probably self destruct 
 Real people want real music, the jig is up 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J Cole] 
 Your worst fear is confirred, we love that you crashed and burn the real is back 
 KDOT it’s your turn, take your victory lap 
 King Cole salutin’ Compton’s own King Kendrick 
 That's the sky is falling, the wind is calling 
 Stand for something or die in the morning 
 The city hail King Kendrick Lamar 
 The world hail King Kendrick Lamar 
  
 [Hook] 
 [Outro] 
 This is my life and I look at it like it's my last 
 And I’m lookin’ right past the future as I reminisce on my past 
 And I don’t even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast 
 And I don’t even drink like I used too, and I don’t even smoke 
 So you know this natural flow is for users since they want to go to rehab 
 Lookin’ at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them 
 Then but I won’t say my bad, see I just lay in the cut 
 Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what 
 See now we dumpin’ out the roof[K.Dot] 
 Weezy Up, K.Dot 
  
 [Wayne] 
 The homie K.Dot, he crazy too 
  
 [K.Dot] 
 Love 
  
 [Wayne] 
 I cosign this, shout out to my homie Jay Rock too, he's my nigga too 
  
 [Jay Rock] 
 Your nigga? Shit 
  
 [Wayne] 
 You're my homie I'm telling you 
 I co-sign it[Intro] 
 Change is coming, change is here 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Holla if you hear me 
 In the memory of 2Pac sincerely 
 Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars 
 Steal a nigga's box like it was ours 
 Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up 
 We just hold up our guns like championship cigars 
 Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw 
 I remember it all, them early Compton days 
 Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways 
 Montgomery never saw the dime bags 
 Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over 
 Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage 
 Never came in the truck no more, we back seat 
 Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance 
 If you're shot in the heart bleeding 
 Ouch 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's gutter when the sun come up 
 When the sun go down 
 Nothing but tears, no onions 
 Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come 
 Don't go looking for it 
 Don't look like you hard 
 You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya 
 Before that warm temperature warmin' up 
 Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners 
 The neighbors is listeners 
 I'm the future of the new west for you visitors 
 Never mind them other niggas 
 I'm talkin' in particular 
 Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough 
 I'm igloo cold with it 
 If California snows then I did it 
 The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard 
 The OG aim they guns at the moon 
 Bullets break through the atmosphere 
 Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here 
 And I can see you scared (whew) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Real gangsters either dead or in jail 
 And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells 
 I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail 
 And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell 
 And I had that mind state since twelve 
 No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats 
 5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math 
 That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad 
 But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained 
 Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ? 
 This business got too many villians 
 Superman is back 
 The cape ain't red, it's black 
 That's a trench coat 
 And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation 
 Watch your headsYeah, follow me, uh 
  
 Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees 
 Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode 
 I been at bat for so many years 
 Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages 
 Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant 
 Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics 
 Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke 
 I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope 
 You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke 
 A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies 
 Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene 
 I sic a lyric on you like K-9's from the police 
 Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo 
 I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper 
 Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle 
 A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now 
 Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30 
 You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto 
 Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net 
 And they tell 'em K-Dot got next 
 And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked 
 From your baby momma 
 On my momma, brain like a genius 
 I'm travelin' to Venus 
 Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks 
 Snub-nose, Kleenex 
 I suppose I done drove artists to a place 
 Where the daily deceased sleep at 
 Competition comin' up short like a dwarf 
 But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow 
 Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe 
 Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease 
 God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas 
 Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art 
 Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents 
 'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony 
 Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room 
 Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers 
 They raise Conans with survival tactics 
 You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics 
 Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods 
 Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage 
 Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't 
 This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath 
 A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot 
 Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah[Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm on Union Square 
 Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there 
 Me and my man, no one compare 
 That's like two left shoes, you fools 
 I'm so rude, my flow is so crude 
 Spit at the mouth, foam and drool 
 I'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal 
 Looking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess 
 Lift my flows like I flip your wife 
 And pass it to Sounwave down the way 
 You know he's nice 
 ADHD, producer, recruit ya 
 To the armies ? 
 Take a nigga to war 
 You know how I'm about to settle the score 
 Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards 
 Come and get me, you're nothing but target practice 
 You're actors, coming at you with my flows 
 Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton 
 You get stomped on, what is you're talking about? 
 You don't want none..[Kendrick Lamar] 
 My turbulence put a burden on young herds 
 And once it's cracking it's a chain reaction 
 Minus Young Berg 
 Killing with no excellence 
 X-amount with no excellence 
 To X em out with these words 
 Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind 
 No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines 
 Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated 
 And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis 
 Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas 
 On the stretcher. A understatement to say 
 That K Lamar was under pressure 
 Don't press your luck when you pressed for time 
 Cause when the press get this verse 
 They're sure to press rewind 
 A president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac 
 Codeine, crack and codiac 
 Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we 
 Wyling on the corners with the ? rats 
 Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti 
 Don't run his trap. See the fans that tap out 
 That's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case 
 With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch 
 We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies 
 Fuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton 
 My impurity is probably your best asset 
 Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address 
 Leave em stagnant 
 This is torture when I scorch ya 
 Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts 
 And all sorts of criminal handshakes 
 Your man can't stick to the script 
 With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip 
 Then poppin your van, wait 
 I want the peace. But keep the piece 
 That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You know once upon a time, not long ago 
 There was a caterpillar that lived life slow 
 And a couple inches he stood 
 And he said to the butterfly, "What's good?" 
 And the butterfly told him one day he gon' make him rich 
 And then they said something else 
 I don't remember what they said 
 But I think it was something like the lines of: 
  
 Wesley's Theory: 
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool 
 Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room 
 Snatch your little secretary thing for the homies 
 Blue-eyed devil with a fat old monkey 
 I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours 
 Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four 
 Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring 
 Married to the game and a bad thing chose 
 When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap 
 Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap 
 Take a few M-16s to the hood 
 Pass them all out on the block, what's good? 
 I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House 
 Republican run up, get socked out 
 Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck 
 Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check hold on 
  
 [Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat] 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave brothers 
 Money go back home, money go back home 
 We should've never gave 
 We should've never gave brothers, money go back home, money go back home 
  
 Momma: 
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This feeling is unmatched 
 This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap 
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back 
 Been in it before internet had new acts 
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack 
 My innocence limited the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribbling scratching diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
  
 [Interlude: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)] 
 (Kendrick Lamar) Oh, what's going on? 
 (Something's on my mind) I think something on my mind, too 
 (I think it's about that time) I think it's about that time 
 (Put a little pimping in my pocket) Hit me! 
  
 King Kunta: 
 [Intro 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I got a bone to pick 
 I don't want you monkey-mouth... sitting in my throne again 
 (Hold up) 
 I'm mad (he mad!), but I ain't stressing, noo 
 True friends, one question 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me, where you when I was walking? 
 Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Tell me where you when I was walking? 
 Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & (Anna Wise)] 
 When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
 The yam is the power that be, be, be, be, be 
 You can smell it when I'm walking down the street 
 (Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) 
 I can dig rappin' 
 But a rapper with a ghost writer, tell me what happened to you? 
 (Oh no!) 
 No, I swore I wouldn't tell 
 But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?) 
 Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
 And if I gotta brown nose for some gold 
 Then I'd rather be a bum than a dumb, dumb baller 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me, where were you when I was walking? 
 Now I run the game got the whole world talking, King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Tell me where were you when I was walking? 
 Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)] 
 When you got the yams... (What's the yams?) 
 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor, R.I.P. 
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
 24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplating getting on stage 
 Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me, where were you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Tell me where were you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 When you got the yams... (What's the yams?) 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 (You goat-mouth, mammy f-) 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, even need my help 
 This is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screaming "Compton!" 
 I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo, too 
 (Twenty million walkin' out the court building, woo woo!) 
  
 u: 
 [Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Aahh, aahh, aahh! 
 I place blame on you still, place shame on you still 
 Feel like you ain't it, feel like you don't feel 
 Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors 
 Watching anonymous strangers, telling me that I'm yours 
 But you ain't it, I'm convinced your tolerance nothing special 
 What can I blame you for, I can name several 
 Situations, I'll start with your little sister baking 
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience? 
 What was your influence, where was the influence you speak of? 
 You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
 I tell you, you damn failure — you ain't no leader! 
 I never liked you, forever despise you — I don't need you! 
 The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
 Numbers lie too, buck your pride too, that's for dedication 
 Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
 I hate you, I hope you embrace it 
 I swear 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is -mplicated 
 Loving you is compli-, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated 
 Loving you is complicated 
 Loving you, not loving you, one hundred proof 
  
 [Bridge] 
 (I can feel your body recognize that you're ashamed of me) 
 You're afraid of me 
 (Yes I hate you too) 
 Yes I 
  
 [Outro] 
 When you look in my eye 
 Tell me there's more inside 
 Tell me you're feeling high 
 Tell me you're here tonight 
 Tell me you hear my pain 
 Hear my soul, how you feeling? 
 Now you know 
 If you see it, if you would, God 
 Now get the gold yeah 
 Wooh![Verse] 
 See, I'm the man, tell 'em roger that 
 I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back 
 My pockets fat, if not they getting there 
 That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there 
 See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs 
 You either talking money or just remain the mime 
 She got a fat ass with an amazing mind 
 That mean great brain 
 I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein 
 Now ain't that true love? 
 I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love 
 And you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love 
 I'm talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers 
 Tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups 
 Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion 
 I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader 
 You'll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs 
 You know[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Life is full of up and downs 
 Twists and turns 
 But somehow we keep on steppin' 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me? I’m just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated, every nook and cranny 
 I mean it's still amazing before they couldn’t stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I’m here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around demolition might crush 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)] 
 If these walls could talk (Step) 
 I can feel your (Step) reign when it cries, (Uh) gold lives inside of (Step) you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, (Uh) I love it when I’m in it 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep 
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I’ve been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I rather miss them 
 I rather call, I rather diss them 
 I rather fall on you, put your wall up 
 Cause when I come around demolition go crush 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)] 
 If these walls could talk (Uh) 
 I can feel (Step) your reign when it cries (Chi-town step), gold lives inside of (Step) you 
 If these walls could talk (Step) 
 I love it (? step) when I’m in it, I love it when (? step) I’m in it 
 (Uh) 
  
 [Interlude: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And reality is 
 Sometimes through these ups and downs 
 You gotta know when to lead or to follow 
 Keep steppin' 
 Chi-town 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late 
 Your destiny accepted your fate 
 Build accessories and stash them on the are 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening no calling CO 
 No calling your homie to save you 
 Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 (That sentence so important) 
 Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me" 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hour of the morning 
 About her baby daddy that's currently serving life 
 How she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she messing with famous rapper 
 Walls could talk 
  
 [Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)] 
 (Uh, hey) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (Yeah) 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk (Yeah, hey) 
 (I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it) 
 (Yes)[Intro: Kanye West] 
 Woman arrested for gettin' naked 
  
 [Verse: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West] 
 Barrel straight through the peephole 
 Tell your parents that we home 
 Propaganda that we own 
 Crime infested, not contested 
 Block conventions and street zones 
 My redemption won't be long (woman) 
 My religion, fear no man (arrested) 
 Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin') 
 Horror stories and romance (naked) 
 Devils that like to slow dance 
 Kettles burnin' with sin in them 
 Children don't wanna hold hands 
 Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin' 
 Fire burnin' through skylines 
 Follow fortune through guidelines 
 Bloody Jordans and Popeye's 
 Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high 
 More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada" 
 Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt) 
 Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua 
 Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it 
 Fuck it, flip on the stop sign 
 Duck a clip in that drive-by 
 Fuck a bitch in the Honda 
 Celebrate to a minor 
 Makin' wishes for Jannah 
 Pump your fist up far higher 
 Reminiscin' Messiah 
 Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am 
 Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman) 
 Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you 
  
 [Outro: Kanye West] 
 I hate when people at me 
 I'm hurt, so, nigga, don't at me[Hook] 
 Now you got a body 
 But what I love most is how you put 
 Put your lips on top of me 
 You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life 
 Wait! 
 Your girl look better than you 
 You know what that means, I'm done with you 
 Bye! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm 
 Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm 
 Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm 
 I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back 
 And the heat lay right, right, right under that 
 Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat 
 That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy 
 I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy 
 Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money 
 With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me 
 Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle 
 100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child 
 Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow 
 Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial 
 Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow 
 I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up 
 Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page 
 You ain't sticking to the script 
 Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex 
 Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat 
 Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that 
 All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap 
 Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap 
 I rap like I got angels on my back 
 God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit 
 I don't write it 
 Off the top like a psychic 
 I kick, lyrics like Jet Li 
 Which produce money to put your boy on the beach 
 Shit, sand in my feet 
 Tell me what the fuck you know bout me 
  
 [Hook][Hook] 
 You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 You heard me, you heard me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My gun got many ways to get you 
 You get hit with a missile and live, you would need barbed wire to stitch you 
 This is not fictional, this here is typical 
 I will bring it to your door if you can't see the visual 
 Black Manson, won't you ask him 
 How I have sex with the trigger just to make the barrel orgasm 
 Remember when it started, nobody protected me 
 Had to make way for school in the mornin' and niggas sweatin' me 
 Where you from? Like shit, I'm tired of niggas questionin' me 
 Now I'm in, I gotta have that thing next to me 
 Went to my pop's closet 
 The next day I'm pullin' up my pants, grabbin' my crotch and walkin' awkward 
 Somethin' pop off, then I have somethin' to spark with 
 By the bus stop like man I wish somebody'd push me 
 I'mma let the hawk spit, with a killin' instinct 
 Like some of these students gonna have an early coffin 
  
 [Hook] 
 You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 You heard me, you heard me 
 You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?

 [Verse 2] 
 Now I got a love Jones for that [?] still on 
 Michael Jackson niggas, the fifth'll change your skin tone 
 Sniper guns'll chirp [?] 
 They'll prolly chirp silent when your Nextel is off speakerphone 
 How real is that? Never 
 Now niggas do dirt in daylight cause the [?] is clever 
 I resign to the fact, that any [?] where the drama is at 
 I'm reclinin' [?] 
 Keep your wordplay intact 
 And 50 couldn't say it better 
 Can't find you, show me where his mama live at 
 You a gangsta, I'm not one, but it doesn't mean 
 By all means, I'm not very able to pump a shotgun 
 [?] and watch as you [?] 
 With the MAC or the Ruger, nigga I got options 
 So while you play possum, I sit and watch 'em 
 Creepin', Nas got his so you fucked if you don't got one 
  
 [Hook] 
 You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?

 Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me? 
 You heard me, you heard me 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I don't know about you, but see, baby I'm ruthless 
 Try to fight me, and see, baby you're useless 
 Shots from the MAC do more than have you toothless 
 The sound is exclusive, bang bang bang, boom 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I explode like a Vietnam bomb 
 Hotter than firemans but my hand got a firearm 
 Fire at your arm, titty, and hands, breakin' your palms 
 Usin' them to snatch purses the brand of Louis Vuitton 
 Nigga, what type of shit you on? It's simple mass destruction 
 Revengeance, tension, you see I've had enough 
 Did I mention? I sniff you pussy niggas out 
 The smell that you bring has aroma like an incensce 
 Play matrix, see if you the one 
 It's a million ways to die and this here is number one 
 And that's starin' down a barrel of a gun 
 After I smack you 'til it's gun powder on your tongue 
 Cause boy them shells get hotter than the sun 
 And boy when I spit, please be prepared to run 
 Boy, don't forget to have a vest when I come 
 Cause I'll hit your chest and clog up your lungs mothafucka 
  
 [Hook] 
 You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?

 Welcome to our private affair 
 Where, the narrow be right here

 Together we can slide through 
 Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes 
 Make sure that that head right, damn right 
 I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government 
 Dayum, hate the game, hate on me 
 And I'm loving it 
 I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly 
 I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it 
 Gone in my fast car 
 Circle round the block twice 
 So they know you [?] 
 God damn it I'm nice (I know) 
 And I see a lot of haters in this room 
 I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Pull up in something brand new 
 Sipping on that goosey goose 
 I see some haters in this room 
 So we tell 'em I love you 
 Pull up in something brand new 
 Sipping on that goosey goose 
 We got some haters in this room 
 What we tell 'em? I love you 
 You, make, my life complete 
 I wonder where would I be 
 If it wasn't for you 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ugh, check out the denim bitch 
 [?] jeans, that's some Japanese shit 
 That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it 
 Don't worry bout the name 
 Just know that they cost 3000 
 Compton, California 
 Home of them p-public houses 
 Where the beast live 
 And you can hear the city growlin' 
 Maserati prowlin' 
 Humping on your neighbourhood corner 
 Mother fucker I'm ballin' 
 No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them 
 Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker 
 That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker 
 [?] every time a nigga spending so I got it on splash like a motherfucker 
 3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come 
 Fuck them motherfuckers 
 Damn right, I could put that on my life 
 I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry) 
 100 horsepower in my car 
 But I act a donkey 
 They see me when I see them then I say 
 What up homie? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)

 When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)[Ab-Soul] 
 Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe 
  
 It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess 
 Pretty Chick let me see them breast 
 E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo) 
 Solo but I'm never alone (that's right) 
 I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo) 
 Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all 
 All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC 
 It's 82 degrees and my top off 
 And they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg 
 Women, weed, and weather what more can I say 
 To live and die in LA 
 Spend a week on Venice beach - 
 I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls 
  
 [Schoolboy Q] 
 Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye); 
 Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored 
 Come and join the wave (aye); 
 Girl, what is your name 
 Cause I'm feeling your frame 
 Can I see what you bout (uh); 
 A little something in your rear 
 Little something in your mouth 
 Little something on your couch (uh); 
 Know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out 
 Cause I killed it, I done drilled it 
 She said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh) 
 She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried 
 Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes 
 But when you got the recipe its no surprise 
 Bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Dr. Dre)] 
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living 
 Women, weed and weather (they come for) 
 Women, weed and weather 
 For the women, weed and weather 
 (from all around the world for the) 
 Women, weed and weather 
 Got that women, weed and weather - 
 Don't it sound clever, come and play 
 Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some 
 Three W's only for a three day, run 
 Bitch, take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no, nun (shit) 
 I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes 
 Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control 
 Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old 
 You want to be one 
 To peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone 
 And pee on their hearts 
 She in the coupe, she in the Neon 
 Cause she on the BS before we can start 
 Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga 
 Let 'em know the priority order me 
 Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees 
 Boy he's on his job 
 Boy he sure be having the marks on they mark 
 Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts 
 Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice 
 No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right 
 We want to be one, to peak on the chart 
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts 
 Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault 
 Then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [Jay Rock] 
 Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess) 
 Everybody know I got that yola, ask (Keisha) she'll confess 
 I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on 
 (No Make Up) (uh) 
 Medicated, please my nigga no telling 
 Where the high gonna take us, uh 
 Three w's, I'm at the W, she got double D's 
 Bout to bring trouble through 
 OG, Hennessy get their panties wet 
 I'm trying to dive in the (Swimming Pool) 
 Left stroke, right stroke 
 Whats the best stroke 
 That stroke can smoke all down her throat 
 And we blows all kinds of dro 
 Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga 
  
 [Chorus][Intro] 
 That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight 
 I was told when niggas bark you should bite 
 And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough pedigree to scare something 
 They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin 
 Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest 
 Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman 
 I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong 
 Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face 
 Tell hop out that bucket and spray 
 Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist 
 Tell them to circle round the block twice in case 
 Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death 
 Scream fuck the world with a capital F 
 Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left 
 And this is how we think 
  
 [Hook] 
 No tongue tissue niggas around me 
 Just a hundred cement niggas around me 
 We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours 
 And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war 
 Tell em' 
 No teddy bear niggas around me 
 Just a hundred cement niggas around me 
 We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours 
 And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical 
 You either born with it or real niggas around real kids 
 And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it 
 You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences 
 And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred 
 Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it? 
 I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots 
 Motherfucker, we will fuck ya 
 Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker 
 I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid 
 We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it 
 You either fall now or stand with it 
 You either crawl now or get laid down 
 Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute 
 Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late 
 Motherfucker, meet your fate 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Look between my eyes 
 You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires 
 And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five 
 Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit 
 Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits 
 Put them on our feet and reshape them shits 
 Now don’t they look sweet? 
 Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week 
 That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic 
 You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets 
 Mel Gibson, you just actin' 
 Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice 
 Teach you niggas a lesson or two 
 Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you? 
 Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga 
 You rappers ain’t built like us 
 Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough 
 We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff 
 And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs 
 The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal 
 Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t loseI'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new [?] 
 [???] the front lines 
 Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times 
 Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie 
 The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it 
 Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up 
 I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs 
 I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC 
 My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me 
 I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's 
 We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me 
 Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom 
 This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back 
 It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey 
 Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay 
 Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase 
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes 
 Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career 
 Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad 
 It's inspiration, something y'all have never had 
 If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news 
 Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT 
 I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space 
 You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here 
 But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz 
 The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his" 
 No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids 
 Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water 
 Do we really fuck with president Carter? 
 My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses 
 Got the bidding war popping like an auction 
 Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more 
 Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door 
 Money in front of me I couldn't open the door 
  
 I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind 
 I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers 
 Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect 
 Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next 
 Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet 
 Hopping all over beats without going through training camp 
 Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at 
 Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre 
 You recycle the same quotes, you're not 
 Switching your flow, your flow in the same place 
 Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps 
 My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych 
 Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right? 
 The metaphors I write 
 In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show 
 Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo 
 A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc 
 A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino[Produced by DJ Dahi]

 And I been hustlin' all day

 And that's just how I feel, nah, nah

 That’s just how I feel, nah 
 A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with

 Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head) 
 He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish) 
 That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same) 
 A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain) 
 But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin') 
 Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin') 
 Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish) 
 They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold) 
 And we gon' crash it when nobody's home 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 It go Halle Berry or hallelujah 
 Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'

 But the one in front of the gun lives forever

 Classic Timeless rules forever 
  
 [Talking] 
 By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic 
  
 [Freestyling] 
 I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental 
 I bet I make bells ring 
 I bet I make birds sing 
 It sounds that good 
 I'm so street and I'm so hood 
 And I'm intelligent and I'm special and I'm heaven sent 
 Haha 
  
 When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics 
  
 Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin' style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts 
  
 Hot off the press 
 Hot off success 
 Look how I dress free, me 
 Reebok complete[Intro] 
 Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… 
 I feel like 
 I feel like 
 I feel like 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Bumping some shawty 
 Rollin my window down and hitting the highway 
 No its not Friday 
 But its my day 
 And sometimes shit gotta go my way 
 Niggas got me fucked up 
 Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks 
 Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks 
 But never mind that 
 Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at 
 You know where my grind at 
 Inside of the studio where I spend my time at 
 Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax 
 Miss me with that bullshit haters die young 
 You can run to the poor pit 
 Pullin' off the pit stop 
 Car like a flip flop 
 Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot 
 I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company 
 Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company 
 Kendrick the good kid 
  
 [Hook] 
 As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me 
 I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later 
 Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say 
 I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nigga, what I depose be so potent 
 That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean 
 Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin' 
 I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon 
 Takin' action in the heat of the night 
 So if the devil came tell him that I be alright 
 I’m so high off life that I can OD 
 Walk outside then sniff a whole key 
 Old lady done called the police 
 Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex 
 Don’t be afraid to speak 
 So to speak you niggas not within arm reach 
 Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat 
 You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest 
 Kendrick be thy name 
 I got my mind right 
 My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write 
 Ink over my brain 
 What's up 
  
 [Hook] 
 As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me 
 I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later 
 Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say 
 I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So let me start off the third verse 
 Pickin' up your favorites is our curse 
 Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion 
 Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons 
 Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin' 
 Fuck you because you don’t see my vision 
 I fucked your new girlfriend too 
 Because she’s cute and the ass 
 Looks like a grenade within the denim 
 Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches 
 Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas' 
 Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin' 
 Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin' 
 Whether you fuck with me or not 
 I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props 
 Fuck keepin' it real 
 I'm a keep it K-dot 
 Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie 
 Fucker 
  
 [Hook] 
 As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me 
 I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later 
 Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say 
 I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today 
  
 [Outro] 
 Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…Into: 
 (Kendrick Lamar speaking) 
  
 "Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated... 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream? 
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened? 
 And real life situations was artificial 
 They say we only live finna die 
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell 
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves 
 Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense 
 It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him 
 Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids 
 Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale 
 Cus' we ain't gonna win 
 Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen 
 (shit) 
 Don't mind me I'm just thinking again 
 Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud 
 Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes 
 Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers 
 Hard to write the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes 
 It's not a game, it's nothing to play with 
 Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay 
 Show what it is 
 I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life 
 That means what I'm thinking is right 
 Punch, loop the beat for a minute 
 Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home 
 Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon 
 Wait a minute [K. Dot!) you said turn it back on, bring it back 
 If dreams was reality 
 If it was cool for you to be a casualty 
 The only way you can escape poverty 
 Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time 
 You're listening too far if you hear this part 
 I suggest you go back and press rewind 
 I fast forward to common thrust of a human 
 Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint 
 Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix 
 Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music 
 O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it 
 Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving 
 Direct them to a casket 
 Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want... 
 If they wanna see reality [haha] 
 I'm losing you again ain't I? 
 Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states? 
 Black President, they don't wanna see that 
 It's evident...pain is pain 
 We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness 
 I swear to God that we live in a Matrix 
 Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships 
 Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best 
 Bring each other down, crab in a bucket of fit 
 We learn to live with it I guess 
 I mean dive with it, since we're already dead 
 Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time 
 Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down 
 Teach you about the things that we live around 
 Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in 
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch] 
 When the dreams was reality and money was love 
 What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity 
 Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity 
 Traveling, no direction, the aim is casualty 
 American dream or Scarface fantasy 
 Kilos of coke and the arms of black families 
 We use to it, our hearts draped in stone 
 A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back soon 
 Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash 
 End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast 
 Now another mother screams picking out his casket 
 Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not 
 It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life 
 And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice 
 The streets mowed him, can't make past that 
 It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh] 
 What happened in Manhattan happens all the time 
 In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime 
 No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness 
 I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president 
 World trade happened on the world stage 
 Same stage look at us as some educated apes 
 On video stations women gyrating 
 Parading around, mind-raping the youth 
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream? 
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened? 
 And real life situations was artificial 
 They say we only live finna die 
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell 
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves 
 Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway[Kendrick Lamar] 
 Riding around town, big taxi 
 I’m out in London, please don’t ask me 
 I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali 
 I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali 
 Said I’m riding around town, big taxi 
 Out in London, don’t ask me 
 I don’t know when I’ll be going back too, kay? 
 Skkrt skkrt, pulling up, G5 land in the valley 
 For the valley girls or them hoochie broads 
 I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if they got some flaws 
 I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if you wife ‘em dog 
 I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em, this is big bruhK-D-O-T, TDE[Verse 1] 
 Now listen my friends, not to offend 
 But this is a story told over again 
 So many niggas tryin' to fuck with the king 
 But the only problem is they can't win 
 I gets down my younging 
 Please turn it up just to sound my younging 
 I burned it up that's your town my younging 
 Either the cake or the trait bound my younging 
 This the brand new trunk 
 Rattling, B tackling 
 Big truck paddling 
 Dime piece beauty peagant-ing 
 Pick em up then they (uh) saddling 
 They bus travelling 
 K Dot that boy got the crazy flow 
 Maybach then 1964 
 With my brim kind of tilted low 
 So fresh oh yes it's me suppose 
  
 [Hook] 
 I got a house on the hill 
 Put that on somethin' 
 Put that on somethin' man 
 Put that on somethin' 
 26 inch rims 
 Put that on somethin'

 Too bad, too fly, too much 
 And that's on me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I move quick enough for your eyes won't see 
 That boy hussled up, everything for cheap 
 These chickens tryin to plot on a boy 
 So a nigga gotta move kinda low 
 (Low what?) low key 
 I put 26 inch rims on the ride 
 Big truck fit five chicks at a time 
 Stones big enough you can go rock climb 
 Put that on somethin' 
 Nah man I was lying 
 But tell me what you know about it (know about it) 
 Fat camp I can't go without it (go without it) 
 This ain't hot, I truly doubt it 
 Mapped out the whole game so reroute it 
 ‘Cause look here boo you fucking with a champion 
 K Dot the don, moving the blocks you on 
 Taking a spot of shawn, I'm on top you're on 
 Industry remember me, cause I so crazy 
  
 [Hook] 
 I got a house on the hill 
 Put that on somethin' 
 Put that on somethin' man 
 Put that on somethin' 
 26 inch rims 
 Put that on somethin' 
 Put that on somethin' man

 I put that on everything I love 
 Too bad, too fly, too much 
 And that's on me 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My mama, my daddy, my gram's grand papi 
 This ain't rappin' nigga, this is a classic 
 This hard work nigga it just didn't happen 
 .44 magnum put a nigga in his casket 
 K Dot drastic nigga I am a savage 
 So quick to let a motherfucker have it 
 All the girlies like, he so crazy 
 I wish daddy could have my baby 
 I get with ‘em they like, he so shady 
 They cry I got it like, he won't pay me 
 Not a god damn dime mommy 
 The dividends that's raked in, that's mine mommy 
 You wanna leave then go ahead, it's fine mommy 
 K Dot a magnet, to fine mommys 
 Plus I ain't hard to find mommy 
 Studio, yeah we stays on the grind mommy

 [Outro] 
 Aye check this out 
 I just copped me that new H1 and H2 and A3 
 That A3 that new [?] 
 That motherfucker sick right there 
 I stay in the hills 
 The hollywood hills next to omarion 
 I got 26 inch wheels 
 I got a pool, inside of a pool, inside of a jacuzzi 
 And I ain't lying 
 Man, I'm not lying 
 My sister got a jacuzzi in her bed, in her pool 
 That's how we living 
 That's on me 
 That's everything I love[Intro] 
 It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly 
 Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh 
 Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop? 
 I'm 'bout to give you a prime example 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at? 
 Where my nickels and dimes at? 
 .45's Mac 10's and nines at? 
 9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat 
 If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer 
 You wanna die? I can help you 
 Put the rap beef aside and [?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised 
 I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime 
 Mike Jordan in his heyday 
 Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines 
 I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred 
 Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas 
 Grandpa moved to Mississippi 
 I really can't tell if dude missed me 
 Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe 
 More reason why my heart cold 
 Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio 
 We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen 
 They just kick down the door as if they have permission 
 Why you had to do that for? 
 I wish Pro Tools was on record 
 Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something 
 No assumptions, I know I'm nice 
 I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass 
 Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan 
 Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration 
 Rather do that before I catch court cases 
 Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic 
 Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin' 
 Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen 
 K. Dot's in my colon 
 That nigga, Colon Powell 
 Modern day war victim 
 Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition 
 No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant 
 Feel relentless, new apprentice 
 King of, comprehension 
 No competition 
 Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that 
 No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts 
 You're a disgrace to this rap business 
 Just a one-man office, you need assistance 
 Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors 
 I am a senseless thug, with book smarts 
 And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question 
 We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession 
 Gave you the rhyme scheme before you're English-education 
 Exclamation, put it in quotes 
 I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag 
 The flow, the artist development 
 Am I who gave you the growth? 
 You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed 
 The sun shine, and now king me 
 The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC 
 Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese 
 I said cheese[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died 
 A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside 
 A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes 
 Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job 
 A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter 
 Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father 
 And this before he did a year when them charges brought up 
 I shook my head, turned around then found a $100 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)] 
 I don't know why You keep blessing me 
 I don't know why You keep blessing me 
 I don't know why You keep blessing me 
 I don't know why You keep blessing me 
 I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home 
 The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone 
 A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome 
 Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone 
 A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door 
 Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor 
 I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord 
 Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy 
  
  
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling 
 Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling 
 I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain 
 Is my life coincidental or just God willing 
 I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window 
 See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know 
 Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for 
 Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol 
  
 [Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar (x2)] 
 Now I know why You keep blessing me 
 Now I know why You keep blessing me 
 Now I know why You keep blessing me 
 Now I know why You keep blessing me 
 Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar and BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 So I can bless you 
 So I can bless you 
 So I can bless you 
  
 [Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 Lord help me 
 Cause I need You 
 I know this weed is burning 
 And I'm on drink number two 
 But it's all to soothe the pain from this 
 Cold, cold world 
 Sometimes I think You can help me 
 But this bus here is temporary 
 So I'm talking to You 
 This sick world will drive a sane man crazy 
 Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies 
 And this the news I hear 
 When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year 
 I wonder, will it get better 
 A little cheddar, when it get better 
 But the rest of that's cash 
 Make last year's Christmas gift you, my bad 
  
 [Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid (x2)] 
 But somehow You keep blessing me 
 But somehow You keep blessing me 
 But somehow You keep blessing me 
 But somehow You keep blessing me 
 But somehow, but somehow, but somehow 
  
 [Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid] 
 If I just keep the faith 
 I know You'll be right there 
 Sometimes it may not seem that You are there 
 But You're there 
 I feel You're there 
 You're everywhere 
 And I thank You for 
 Protecting me in these streets 
 From danger seen and unseen 
 I never know 
 What happened the night 
 I wasn't there 
 Something told me leave so I left 
 It was the next morning 
 Three got shot after the club 
 All listening to that small voice 
 Oh you saved my lifeReminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic 
 Now we puffing the kush and I'm like 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 For giving the West Coast CPR 
 Now here we are, we like to 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 We can never pay you back 
 All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap 
 For that (thank you doctor) 
 Without further adieu 
 Diggy Doc, this one is for you 
 I remember growing up 
 Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang 
 It's that gin and juice in my cup 
 And all I knew was N.W.A 
 Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre 
 Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised 
 Kurupt and RBX, the original gang 
 Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days 
 D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised 
 And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit 
 Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit 
 Killa Cali where it all started 
 Legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it 
 This west shit 
 It's history in the making, this is the next step 
 California's best kept, yep 
 It's your own Scoe, I'm a Y.A gangsta rider 
 On behalf of the South Central L.A, we wanna 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic 
 Now we puffing the kush and I'm like 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 For giving the West Coast CPR 
 Now here we are, we like to 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 We can never pay you back 
 All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap 
 For that (thank you doctor) 
 Without further adieu 
 Diggy Doc, this one is for you 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
  
 I remember when it all started 
 On Alondra, in that small apartment 
 Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges 
 Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments 
 Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan 
 I was only four, but it's like I heard it before 
 A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded 
 And according to my awareness I was more than coherent 
 A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot 
 My cousins kicking up dust Cripping 
 They flag, wear it 'round their hand like a mitton 
 Aiming, use it for leverage 
 Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police" 
 Woofers and gold Rollies 
 Every swap meet should know me 
 Cause I copped every record that dropped 
 Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop 
 A jewel for the sake of hip-hop 
 Who ever have thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for Cali love 
 Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic 
 Now we puffing the kush and I'm like 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 For giving the West Coast CPR 
 Now here we are, we like to 
 (Thank you doctor) 
 We can never pay you back 
 All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap 
 For that (thank you doctor) 
 Without further adieu 
 Diggy Doc, this one is for you[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Two-two, what's the deal homeboy? 
 Aye

 Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit, we gon' death of me

 All the rappers they be talking about, bust right now we gon' IP 
 Hold up, I said hold up 
 You thinking oh what? You can't talk about it 
 If you want to see us come around and move the crowds out 
 Because we got the loudest 
 L.A., we in the streets right here 
 Niggas seen God in projects 
 Everybody in this crowd right now, go and tell me about that prospect 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 Fall in this bitch 
 Like some good pussy, can't stand myself 
 So good, she so hood 
 She a cheesehead, patty melt 
 GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs 
 That shit was happening 
 She reel me in with some chicken wings 
 And some collard greens, that shit was brackin' 
 Just cracked me a new bitch 
 Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey 
 My bitch get off at 9 o'clock 
 So I had to shake her 'round 7:30 
 105, I'm stomping fast 
 With these big guns, I'm hella dirty 
 Get caught with this shit

 Trap star, bitch, spell it with a big T 
 Give a damn if I never be a hot MC 
 Cause I'm a hood nigga, first on everybody's list 
 Buy the whole club P, don't fuck with no Cris 
 That average ass watch can't fuck with my wrist 
 Them average ass hoes can't fuck with my bitch 
 To the window, to the motherfuckin' wall 
 Enough money in my jeans to buy a motherfuckin' mall 
 Got the choppas in the back, bulletproof, that's my Hummer 
 R.I.P. to the competition, this is my summer 
 R.I.P I wanna kill the judge 
 Tryna lock the homie up, they don't feel the thug

 Fuckin' with my ex cause I'm still in love 
 I can teach you how to fuck and how to stack money 
 I ain't went Hollywood, you just act funny 
 Girl I know you want this pipe like a crack bummy 
 Stop playin', I'm tryna hit like a crash dummy 
 Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit

 Cancel her and get another like I'm Nino bitch 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P

 Mossberg, 4 Bent, Compton I live that

 And the molly make the white girl look Chinese 
 OHB, my niggas out here ballin' 
 And all these fake ass artists, y'all niggas out here drawin' 
 Ok now dearly departed I bought a plane, I departed 
 And if you started from the bottom gon' and come out the closet 
 You problematic, I bought them ratchets and automatics 
 Clip hold 32, I make you feel the Magic 
 You gon' see the flashes, like you in a pageant 
 All black suits, and them long Caddys 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P

 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P 
 R.I.P. we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head, almost killed a thug[Verse 1: Punch] 
 I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room 
 Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway 
 Patron shots I consume taking the pain away 
 Each sip bring me closer to my doom 
 Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind 
 Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time 
 It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be 
 Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean 
 For example spitting a 16 
 No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine 
 It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing 
 Now I'm just trying to trap cream 
 Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow 
 What you can do today, that's my new motto 
 With that said, I roll out the bed 
 Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it 
 After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning 
 Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats 
 So me without one is like I'm dated 
 I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces 
 Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored 
 I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens 
 One of the best of God's creations 
 He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations 
 I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating 
 Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented 
 Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony 
 Half of these niggas ain't half of me 
 Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity 
 Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly 
 Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain 
 Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains, Lord, I'm here 
 Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up 
 They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts 
 Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans; 
 They cost so much 
 (?) Usher 
 Either way i'm caught up in materialistic 
 Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it 
 Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip 
 The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent 
 No matter the crime rate I still remain content 
 Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars 
 Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend 
 I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence 
 (Holla) - x4 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Rock] 
 I woke up this morning, counting my cash 
 Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass 
 I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch 
 Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece 
 They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast 
 With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets 
 From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone 
 Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne 
 Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit 
 Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse 
 I don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders 
 Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island 
 I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter 
 Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital 
 You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga 
 I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga 
 Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch 
 I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick 
 I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us 
 See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing 
 But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef 
 Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets 
 I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood 
 This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug 
 Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas 
 Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga 
 Raised in the projects, money my object 
 They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them 
 You'll get shot walking through my section 
 Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school 
 Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing 
 Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens 
 Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless 
 Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target 
 (target) - x4[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 What I look like, a sucker to you, nigga? 
 Fuck you, rookie 
 Somethin' incredible, heh-heh-heh 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit 
 Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit 
 Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch 
 And kick her out before the sun come up 
 Nigga, my funds is up 
 I got my money right 
 Business movin' like New York City lights 
 Bitches all over that boy 
 Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut 
 But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up 
 And I ain't goin' out just like that 
 I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow 
 Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit 
 Every stop sign got a hollow tip 
 Every sunshine got a hood under it 
 And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit 
 My bones made out of cement, strong arm 
 Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Heh-heh-heh, okay, I'm ready, ha-ha 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell your boyfriend to do it like this 
 A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch 
 I was born with diamonds in my wrist 
 So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck 
 Straight nasty, don't walk past me 
 I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it 
 I would kill it only if you say 
 I'm more than willin' to take advantage 
 Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties 
 Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin' 
 I take 'em, then I perform magic 
 Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened 
 And go and tell the DJ to play my shit 
 You never heard nothin' like this, yuh 
 The new West Coast's best-kept secret 
 Chronic smoke comin' out my throat, ha-ha 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm goin' in 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 They say, "Who that?" K. Dot, no roof, new top 
 They hate, they watch, speed down the block 
 In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock 
 In a shoot-out with anybody that you got 
 .45, no lie, no problem 
 If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him 
 Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy 
 I'm a run in his house, then ask, "Where the cash, boy?" 
 "Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time 
 That you ever have a gun in your face" 
 Might be the last time that somebody run in your place 
 You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid 
 I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit 
 I'm 2Pac, I'm inferno, I'm so hot, no chicken 
 Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus 
  
 [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Heh-heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter 
 Shit, psych, Rock, get 'em 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay Rock] 
 Guess who's back? Fresh new fitted, turned back 
 Fresh new spinners on the 'Lac 
 Never knew Rock could do it like that 
 I'm a mack for real, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah 
 Who got this game in a chokehold? 
 We'll make your best rapper submit 
 Pack up and quit cause we the shit 
 Plus, that Calico hold more shells than El Pollo Loco 
 Turn you to a dough salt 
 Take your ho to the mo-mo quick 
 She want to bounce up and down on my pogo stick 
 Me n' Dot spit raw, deejays,  Mr. Miyagi 
 Your records wax us on and wax you off, ha 
 You come frontin', get slammed like Onyx 
 We the West Coast classics, you better pay homage 
 You want problems? The kings of the shoot-outs 
 Leave your block smokin' like a luau 
 Top Dawg E-N-T, bitch 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah 
 Top Dawg, nig, we told you, nigga done did it 
 Yeah, yeah, aye[Bridge] 
 Pour up (drank), head shot (drank) 
 Sit down (drank), stand up (drank) 
 Pass out (drank), wake up (drank) 
 Faded (drank), faded (drank) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles 
 Granddaddy had the golden flask 
 Backstroke every day in Chicago 
 Some people like the way it feels 
 Some people wanna kill their sorrows 
 Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem 
 I was in a dark room, loud tunes 
 Lookin' to make a vow soon 
 That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood 
 Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat 
 Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me 
  
 [Hook] 
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots? 
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock 
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch 
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)

 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick 
 I am your conscience 
 If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick 
 I know that you're nauseous right now 
 And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick 
 If I take another one down 
 I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit 
 I think that I'm feelin' the vibe 
 I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin' 
 The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived 
 This how you capitalize, this is parental advice 
 Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin' 
 I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me 
  
 [Hook] 
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots? 
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

 Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

 [?] 
 If you've got a little I'ma share a thought 
 You from Compton? Get your uncle, poppa 
 He a gangster, he know how to party 
 You ain't nothing like him 
 You a stranger to this 
 G shit 
 Fuck a sip, nigga 
 Take it to the neck, nigga 
 Take it for the dead homies 
 Homie, just a set 
 This the business 
 Many bitches, alcohol 
 Deal with it 
 Be a Navy Seal with it 
 Swim until you feel (drunk)

 Yeah... 
 Hit the East Side of the LBC 
 On a mission trynna find Mr. Warren G 
 When I jumped off the porch, I was forced into last resort 
 Of a typical short end, of course where that took us course 
 Hoarse for yelling out Demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice 
 Killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost 
 Fraud, Piracy of the streets of my Odyssey 
 Caught a bullet that probably destroyed 
 A good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed 
 I walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when i"m just a vegan 
 Reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing 
 Pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason 
 Probably because i'm a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public 
 And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin 
 But you ain't' no friend of me, instead of Kendrick i'm Kennedy 
 Assassinate my character, sure, if that's your remedy 
 Fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang? 
 But that's the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the Compton parade 
 Good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Sittin in the hooptie, looking for a groupie 
 Bitch I'm K-Dot, act like you knew me 
 Got me fucked up me don't pay for no booty 
 You looking for a prize, bitch I'm not no fool G 
 I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties 
 I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby 
 I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young 
 Watch the game like a raven, craving rappers till I'm numb 
 Novacane can contain the pain that I brung 
 Bitch I shine like a microscope bouncing off the sun 
 Words bouncing off my tongue like a damn trampoline 
 Hoes manicure him enough the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off 
 Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank 
 Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross 
 I drift off to the moon, martian 
 Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon 
 Parking my UFO somewhere that you don't know 
 Welcome to the C4 
 You see one you see four 
 Bombs in my peak hold 
 Bombs over Baghdad, son you niggas 
 You can never say I was a bad dad 
 Run you nigga like a marathon 
 This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon 
 Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines 
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumping from the foul line 
 In order to see the king you gotta swim through the ponds 
  
 [Hook: Ab-soul] 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing 
 And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin') 
 Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Rock] 
 K. Dot start it up 
 You hear my engine bitch 
 Pussy wet paint sweeter than some licorice 
 I'm like the homie Nas, I'm on some nigga shit 
 More chains more whips hell yeah I'm living rich 
 We chewing MC's, like some licorice 
 Disrespect, get that ass smoked like a cigarette 
 And I'm the realest yes, keep these bitches wet 
 And we don't give em chips, we just give em dick 
 Got guns on me, cause them niggas hate 
 Better have insurance, cause I'm giving wakes 
 I ain't lifting weights, I lift them .38s 
 9s, .45s, big choppas aiming at yo face 
 Ha ha 
  
 [Hook] 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing 
 And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin') 
 Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin') 
 Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing 
  
 [Verse 3: Ab-Soul] 
 Paint bubblicious, just a lil rusty 
 It's Friday, been on the donut since Monday, highway 
 How I touch sky like Kanye, kill em 
 Black Ali boombayah killa 
 SWAT meet shopping, till I not need nothing 
 Ran between the legs of a naughty women 
 Say it ain't so soul, say it ain't say 
 I ain't fucking with you like Nazi public 
 Fuck em, fuck it, slide in the bucket 
 You rolling on adults I'm sitting on the team summit 
 T-pain on, back steat fucking puffing la la la like a Lil Wayne song 
 And why would I lie like a nigga in denial? 
 When I can tell the truth and be free like style 
 Top notch TV don't touch that dial 
 Unless you finna wash up, you niggas better watch us 
  
 [Hook] 
 Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')

 Everybody wanna play that tough guy 
 'Til them things come out and them shots fly 
 Say your last words homie and it's bye bye 
 You shouldn't have been playin' with me 
 Everybody wanna play that tough guy 
 'Til them things come out and them shots fly 
 Say your last words homie and it's bye bye 
 You shouldn't have been playin' with me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I ain't no killer but don't push me 
 Them very words said can resurrect Pac straight from the dead 
 And it takes a young nigga like me to push the limit 
 No gimmick, this is real homie 
 I wake out of my sleep, sweat drippin' off my face and cheek 
 I swear to God, death callin' for me 
 That's why I carry a heat, roamin' these streets 'til they come and get me 
 Cause ninety percent of them are comin' with me 
 C4 your car doors and watch your shit blow in a jiffy 
 Quick, boom, explode when I empty 
 I'm on the edge so please don't tempt me to jump 
 I walk around with a pump, just to scatter you punk's heads 
 Then go and get some head by that woman you want 
 She does what I says, I says what I does 
 Crazy back then, yeah that's what I was 
 But now I'm psycho, mental nigga, holdin' a grudge 
 I put a hole in your mug, and let the blood leak out 
 Until it fill up a tub, then put your son in it 
 This is no image, this is ether 
 Cocaine, reefer, alcohol mixed with it 
 They tried to label your boy as a menace 
 Put me in some records, along with Guinness 
 I just started, I ain't finished 
 Chest to your head, until all you motherfuckers diminish 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I hope y'all ready to ride 
 Cause it's do or die 
 If not, stay inside 
 I hope you ready 
 If not, be quiet 
 Cause when shots fly 
 Somebody will cry 
 I hope you ready 
 I hope y'all ready to ride 
 Cause it's do or die 
 If not, stay inside 
 I hope you ready 
 If not, be quiet 
 Cause when shots fly 
 Somebody will cry 
 I hope you ready[Intro]

 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin' 
 You can't complain about the flow I got 
 I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts 
 Like the white boys say, "Pass the pot" 
  
 Let me smoke for a minute... 
  
 As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop 
 I'll never pretend to be something I'm not 
 Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible 
 You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally 
 Not being focused with your eyes open 
 They say 90% of humans don't even notice 
 Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened 
 Without you knowing people was laughing at you 
 They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you 
 You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled 
 You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow 
 Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick 
 You never know until your bear witness 
 Bear witness... 
 Bear witness... 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You woke up in the morning, took a shower 
 Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour 
 She came over, you fucked 
 She left and you hopped in the truck, you 
 Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you 
 Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked 
 Under the seat, you headed to long beach 
 Hop on the 710 the carpool lane 
 Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing 
 Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not 
 You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box 
 But one lane before you got there your car stopped 
  
 Stop 
  
 If your was listening for the past two minutes 
 Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosisKendrick: 
  
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I crack the egg on you bastard 
 Why you step to the master 
 Like you sick with this 
 I really do this shit 
 You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty 
 Watch this, I will body 
 Anybody in the crowd 
 You want me john gotti, couldn't see me 
 You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome 
 I'll let you know why every other rapper need to go home 
 This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse 
 I take rappers to new church 
 Who wanna see me, you first 
 Then him second, then you third 
 Nouns, my verbs 
 Battle these words 
 Nigga that shit is absurd 
  
 Troi Breeze: 
  
 OK if I'm 2nd or I'm 3rd 
 Whatever he just said you heard 
 But I'm coming through and I think that I got a new verse 
 Goin' off the top of the dome 
 I'm really tryna change the way that I've been livin' at home 
 I'm really doin' it 
 Nigga I be doin' this 
 Nigga I come through with this 
 Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious 
 Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it 
 Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip 
  
 Kendrick: 
  
 If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it 
 If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it 
 I see you got the waves in your hair i been there 
 Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared 
 But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral 
 This is individual, this here is a ritual 
 This here is spiritual 
 This is not rap , this is god body 
 Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical 
  
 Troi Breeze: 
  
 Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you 
 I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you 
 Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up 
 And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew 
 I really appreciate it 
 I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up 
 Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots 
 Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family 
 Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G" 
 My brotha was from Piru 
 My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street 
  
 Kendrick: 
  
 Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts 
 Then you should already know about them Compton blocks 
 All my niggas that's with me is from the city 
 All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me 
 And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me 
 (crowd roar) 
 You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared 
 Thats that scream that every other clapper scared 
 They dont want shoot back 
 If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in '94 
 This is Kurupt flow 
 This is the LBC shit 
 This the Compton DPGTDE shit 
 FUCK WITH ME SHIT 
  
 Make some noise for my nigga 
  
 Troi Breeze: 
  
 My name is Troi Breeze 
  
 Kendrick: 
  
 Make some noise for Troi Breeze[Intro (Ab-Soul)] 
 Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday 
 Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um 
 (Stick a dick in my ear??) Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway 
 We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby 
  
 [Verse 1 (K Dot)] 
 Down Rosecrans 
 '87 regal sipping on a gold can 
 Gun tucked like the fetal, position 
 Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district 
 Been a coroner like David Banner I'm the owner 
 Of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling "it's me bitches" 
 Who did it, I did it, take 'em where they can't go 
 Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist 
 Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me 
 China-man squinting his eyes because I'm blinding him, my shine is 
 Bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because I like to win 
 Never lose, put me on a pedestal 
 Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes 
 Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom 
 Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (Oohh) 
 Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie 
  
 [Hook (Ab-Soul) (?)] 
 Now with my hopes in the back 
 I could ride like this, or like that 
 Putting all the bullshit aside 
 K Dot be too funkified 
 Tell him he's too cool, bitches 
 Holla "what it do", bitches 
 What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go 
  
 [Verse 2 (K Dot)] 
 They be crackin' like a pack of sunflowers seeds 
 That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D, double D's 
 I learnt that from the dog pound, don't get mad at me 
 I'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties 
 Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie 
 Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family 
 Shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too 
 You all produced the same tendencies 
 While I continue to stack plentl cheese 
 On my expedition to witness my own odyssey 
 Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt 
 Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home 
 All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle 
 Never change up see my muscle, training like I'm constipated bringing in any drama 
 If you insist, I'm six for six 
 Get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back 
 Like winter ended 
 It's like that (like that?) 
 Like that (like that?) 
 Like that (like that?) 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge (K Dot)] 
 C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I live in 
 I got more drank bitch, bring more friends 
 Bitch bring more friends 
 I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I'm repping 
 I got more dick bitch, bring more friends 
 Bitch bring more friends 
  
 [Outro (Ab-Soul)] 
 Ahh, callers, callers call up and um, tell me what you think about that new K Dot record 
 Um who we got on line one 
 (Hey whats going on man this Jerome man I'm gonna be on Avalon and 135th at the car wash ay ay ay fuck that nigga K Dot man he owe me five dollars straight up) 
 Man shut your broke ass up, um next caller man who we got on line two 
 (Um this is Aquaniquashay, yeah Aquaniquashay, this song is tight but tell K Dot 
 Come get his drawers out the middle of my floor) 
 Oh shut yo ass up girl that nigga don't even wear drawers 
 Nah for real I'm just fuckin' with y'all next caller 
 (Yeah man that song harder than a motherfucker dog on the real ya'll need a run that back) 
 Ay Jay Rock nigga is that you? 
 (No, no blood it ain't me, honest it ain't me B) 
 Aw man I gotta, but anyway man, you Top Dawg niggas crazier than a motherfucker 
 Ay, who we got on line four? 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now with my hopes in the back 
 I could ride like this, or like that 
 Putting all the bullshit aside 
 K Dot be too funkified 
 Tell him he's too cool, bitches 
 Holla "what it do", bitches 
 What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go[Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 They say that I'm the one 
 And you, you are the prototype 
 You might have the ears of sound 
 But you already know who they like 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody to hold you real tight 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I am the truth, no lie about it 
 Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth 
 Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines 
 Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold 
 I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better 
 I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter 
 And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving 
 Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep 
 Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me 
 In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef 
 Shall we hesitate or walk down [?] 
 That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us 
 Then leave the house without kissing our mamas 
 The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them 
 Cuz the color haunt them to get too much attention 
 Damn it I liked it thoughs 
 Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose 
 I never seen one till I looked in the mirror 
 There go, huh huh, that's the flow right there 
 You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh 
 I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat 
 I let the instrumentals listen to me 
 I listen to heat, my ears can hear fire 
 I [?] [?] the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete 
 And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef 
 Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day 
 Catchin' bullets like an umpire 
 We tried to stay home but still ain't safe 
 That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it 
 Who can circle 'round the block the fasters 
 If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice 
 We worked it out like barely total 
 Cuz shit happens 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody to hold you real tight 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype 
  
 [Verse 2: Punch] 
 I ain't even rap but let them young boys get ya 
 Paint a perfect picture like I'm rhyming only scripture 
 I'm nice, ice water veins, it's pure no filter 
 Who you get your style from, the same real familiar like I heard it before 
 But reincarnation is a blind man spirit 
 So I ain't going for it, na uh 
 I ain't having it, you getting to board it 
 Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer 
 To you acknowledge to whom gave you life to knowledge in Zion learning and taking deuce through college 
 The prototype for the flows you like 
 I'm surgical Ronald Mike, I cut you up somethin' nice 
 Get out the pocket, I'm sending them skyrockets right through your minds 
 Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah 
 Excites a riot every time I'm rhyming 
 In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior 
  
 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] 
 They say that I'm the one 
 And you, you are the prototype 
 You might have the ears of sound 
 But you already know who they like 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody to hold you real tight 
 You niggas need hugs for real 
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype[Intro] 
 We're livin' in a gold bar (Runnin' to the right law) 
 Duckin' in the trap (Duckin' in the trap) 
 Livin' in a group (Livin' in a group) 
 Watchin' TV (Watchin' TV) 
 Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 Uh, this is a word premiere, this is a world premiere 
 (Hey, hey) 
 Uh, I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 The Devil want to put me in a bow-tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfucker want to down me 
 But an amigo never drowned me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
 [Hook] 
 And I love myself 
 Ho, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?" 
 I love myself 
 Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 I love myself 
 Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it ain't that high 
 I love myself 
 Uh, one day at a time sun gon' shine 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy) 
 What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?) 
 Lift up your head and keep movin'? (Keep movin'?) 
 Or let the paranoia haunt you (Haunt you) 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confident 
 Everybody lack confident 
 How many time my potential was anonymous? 
 How many time the city makin' me promises? 
 So I promise this, huh 
  
 [Hook] 
 I love myself 
 When you're lookin' at me, I tell me, "What do you see?" 
 I love myself 
 Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 I love myself 
 Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy 
 I love myself 
 One day at a time sun gon' shine 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Want to say it's a war outside, bomb in the street 
 Gun in the hood, mob of police 
 Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme 
 (These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation) 
 Aw, man, I duck these cold faces, post a fee-fi-fo-fum basis 
 Uh, dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast 
 Sky can fall down, the wind can cry now 
 Strong in me, I still smile 
  
 [Hook] 
 I love myself 
 Uh, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?" 
 I love myself 
 Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 I love myself 
 Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy 
 I love myself 
 One day at a time sun gon' shine 
 Everybody, hit me 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet) 
 Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep) 
 Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum) 
 My heart undone (My heart undone) 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Aw, man, ay, check this out 
 It's a real Compton thing goin' on right now 
 You feel what I'm talkin' 'bout? You dig that? 
 Sometime I just feel a little bit b-beside myself 
 You know what I'm talkin' 'bout? 
 This here's the return of Enoch 
 And we gon' do it to y'all like this 
 Here we go, one, two, three, hit me 
  
 [Hook] 
 I love myself 
 The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs 
 I love myself 
 But it can do what it want whenever it want and I don't mind 
 I love myself 
 He said I got to get up, life is more than suicide 
 I love myself 
 One day at a time, the sun gon' shine 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I went to war last night with an automatic weapon 
 Don't nobody call a medic 
 I'm a do it 'til I get it right, war last night 
 I've been dealin' with depression 
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message 
 I could, I could never take the lead, never bob and weave 
 Negative is lettin' them annihilate me 
 Evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a buildin' there 
 Money in the ceilin', lay my body in the street 
 Pass me to the buildin' of the holy unseen 
 Pass me to the feelin' of the holy unseen 
 Seen enough, make a everybody scream, "I love myself" 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I lost my head 
 I must've misread what the good book said 
 Oh, woes be me, it's a jungle inside 
 Give myself again 'til the well runs dry 
  
 [Interlude] 
 YG, chicken wings, I love myself 
 I love myself, I love myself 
 Aw, man, ay, ay, homie 
 I told you it's straight up a Compton thing 
 You dig what I'm talkin' about? 
 And this here's dedicated to the homies 
 Y'all feel what I'm sayin'? 
 Sometimes I just get besides myself 
 The return of the Enoch is back 
 You hear what I'm talkin' 'bout? 
  
 [Verse 5] 
 Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life 
 Appetite for the feelin' I can barely describe 
 Where you reside? 
 In a woman, is it in money or mankind? 
 Something's got me losin' my mind 
 Where you at? From the front to the back 
 I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react 
 I thought I found you back in the ghetto 
 When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol 
 Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
 Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
 Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day 
 I could be your advocate 
 I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is 
 I could preach for you with the mighty tongue 
 I'm the one, how can I overcome 
 Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?[Verse] 
 Yeah, that's cool 
 Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart 
 Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts 
 Penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide 
 [?] is connoisseurs, love to eat on our tribe 
 Homie I got love for him 
 Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him 
 Took me on my first mission, transition 
 Good kid turned rapper, pay attention 
 This is deeper than you think 
 Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name 
 We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage 
 Music award [?] for all of the nominee 
 I was promised to win, he was promised to leave 
 With all the favorite accessories 
 The one's the big budget videos had especially 
 Just a shadow in the dark, blendin' in with all the industry friends 
 So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what![Verse 1] 
 Hallelujah, K. Dot'll do ya 
 Quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick y'all 
 And get fucked by the millisecond 
 Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth (Buh!) 
 Shots at you like a sawed-off 
 Aiming for your grill like I'm Paul Wall 
 Then peal 'til I not y'all 
 My cerebral cortex is like a war vet 
 Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead 
 Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck 
 'Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma 
 And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer 
 Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer 
 Like VH1, that's far beyond your comprehension 
 Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing 
 Who they fearing? K. Dot 
 Tickle the nipples of women 
 Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 K. Dot got the unorthodox flow 
 On fire, make a rapper burn his soul 
 Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals 
 Numero uno, city in my rearview 
 Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse 
 Pity, here you fool who? 
 Go against me, I rebuke thee 
 And wake thee up, six in the morning 
 With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down 
 Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound 
 Pans, pots, plates, bowls 
 I'm in your kitchen eating your stove 
 I'm hungry and hibernated 
 I'm cold as Miles Davis 
 I load up then I aim it 
 No judgment for the plaintiff 
 It only gets more heinous, nigga I'm brainless 
 Like a blind bitch who don't suck dick 
 Dinosaur manure, big shit 
 Smell me or die quick, fucka! 
 (Fuck a hook) 
 (jab, jab, jab, left right) 
 (Fuck a hook) 
 (Damnit, genius) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire 
 (How come?) Silly motherfucker, I'm fire 
 Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn 
 Iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay 
 A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day 
 They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break 
 I'm just saying, I feel I'm the one 
 Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican 
 I gets ignorant with ya 
 Snap me a picture, bitch, I'm famous 
 I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson 
 In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron 
 Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm 
 (Psss) Now that's a stretch Ab-Soul 
 Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes 
 Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back 
 Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap 
 (ee) 
  
 (K. Dot got the unorthodox flow 
 On fire, make a rapper burn his soul 
 Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals) 
 (Look, ee) 
 (Damnit)[Verse 1] 
 This is for my mothafucking Compton babies 
 And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy 
 Dominguez Hospital born 
 Niggas dying fast no life insurance 
 Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured 
 So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave 
 Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate 
 Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates 
 I ain't even burn 'em yet 
 Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked 
 Well done when the second first come 
 I have an acquired taste 
 I will not let not one MC go to waste 
 I will eat all day 
 I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top 
 I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes 
 They're not in my league, the West coast is me 
 I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze 
 I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)? 
 I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and 
 Delete you like an unwanted movie scene 
 Say hello to the team, ain't ya? 
 You're scared ain't ya? 
 The world is anxious for my LP 
 Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D 
 Fucking failure![Verse: 1] 
 As my mind drift 
 Then split, like the middle of a spliff 
 I began to catapult off the cliff 
 Of the unknown, I got a feeling in my funny bone 
 That we're not the same, just antonyms of a different age 
 My soul flock, with the carefree 
 Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a Goldie 
 (Haha) L-M-F-A-O. I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo 
 Then spread slugs 
 My brain matter 
 Is a brain fatter 
 See my vision 
 Or my vision'll stare at ya 
 This is the future if I say so 
 Yall copping fitted caps 
 I'm about to go and cop a halo 
 The God of rap and I mean it 
 I play kickball with Mars 
 And marbles with Pluto and Venus 
 Witness the genius 
 I interact with the inner city villains 
 That are into your circle 
 Like a computer hack 
 Then give you that (Haha)[Chrous] 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Hey lil pretty lil, pretty lil, bish you 
 Walk around with these 
 Make 
 [?] 
  
 [Chrous] 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on me 
 That pussy got a spell on meFrustration (watching you dance) 
 Hesitation (to get in them pants) 
 Come closer baby (so I can touch) 
 One question, am I moving too fast? 
 Cause' I ain't leaving alone feel like I could be honest babe 
 We both know that we're grown 
 That's why I wanna know 
 How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
 Yeah you look good, and I got money 
 But I don't wanna waste my time 
 Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three 
 You look good, we came to party 
 But I don't wanna waste my time 
 Temptation (is calling your name) 
 Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game) 
 Come closer baby (if you like what you hear) 
 Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel) 
 Cause' I ain't leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest babe 
 We both know that we're grown 
 That's why I wanna know 
 How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
 Yeah you look good, and I got money 
 But I don't wanna waste my time 
 Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three 
 You look good we came to party 
 But I don't wanna waste my time 
 Aha, and what do we have 
 Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab 
 That you are likely to catch but your latest ex made you mad 
 So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass 
 Pool full of liquor then we dive in it 
 Knowing if I lick her I might die in it 
 Then reincarnate as a fly gymnast 
 Just to flip my tongue on you 
 This the Olympics 
 State your name, live in the moment 
 It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby 
 She tell me that she never get a first let away 
 And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day 
 Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind 
 Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind 
 Pool full of liquor then we die in it 
 Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it 
 Or waste your time, or waste your time 
 Or waste our time, baby it's alright 
 Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah 
 Oh it's alright now 
 Alright oh yeah 
 I don't wanna waste my time, no 
 I don't wanna waste no time, oh no 
 I don't wanna waste your time, babe 
 I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now 
 How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah) 
 Yeah you look good, and I got money 
 But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby) 
 Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three 
 You look good, we came to party 
 But I don't wanna waste my time, waste my time 
 No no no, I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight 
 What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight 
 I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight 
 What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight[Verse 1] 
 Two tears in the bucket I cry with you 
 But I could never lie with you 
 I could never afford not to afford 
 I could never put my plans to the side with you 
 I could never see a red light 
 Like a deer with the headlight 
 I freeze up when I re-up 
 See I barely had patience 
 And you're relating 
 Only the moment to complete us 
 Why you hate to work for it? 
 Went to work for it 
 See a nine to five was so jive turkey 
 But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me 
 You plead the fifth 
 I read the fifth amendment 
 We both criminals with bad intentions 
 They say time heals all 
 But if I could shortcut 
 My success, Corvettes by tomorrow 
  
 [Hook] 
 But why you so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 They say I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My home girl got a credit card scam 
 She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn 
 Intuition got a black woman wishin' 
 She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan 
 I know you, woman, I console you, woman 
 You feel like the universe owes you, woman 
 Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it 
 Women don't prosper chasing education 
 But you're talented, and can't handle it 
 And your homegirls can't be your manager 
 365 times four, plus more 
 Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina? 
 But ain't no money like fast money 
 Even today I'm considered a crash dummy 
 A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward? 
 My accolades better than all them 
  
 [Hook] 
 But why I'm so sad? 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 They say I’m down on my luck 
 And it’s something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me 
 I love oceans in the deep 
 I love women, I love me 
 I love God 
 But I’m scared of god speed 
 Sometimes 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe 
 You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby 
 Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy" 
 And I said “why?” 
 Then he looked me in the eye 
 He said homie you messed up 
 You breaking my good luck 
 You wishing for miracles 
 Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical 
 Settle for everything, complain about everything 
 Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines 
 You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood 
 You living to keep warm 
 I’m living to pay rent 
 I paid my way through 
 Praying to Allah 
 You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi 
 Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers 
 Same thing go for the ones you came with 
 We all came on the boat looking for hope 
 And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope 
 These days ain’t no compromise 
 Your pain ain’t mine half the time 
 A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me 
 See I made my moves, with shackled feet 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town 
 Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Corn row Kenny 
 I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr 
 I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr 
 Corn row Kenny 
 So many plays on me I finesse 
 Palisade views with some sex 
 I lost a lot of love for missionary 
 This the first time I react 
 Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil 
 A father figure play with him, you get killed 
 Play with me and he will kill you himself 
 TDE the mafia of the west 
 Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that 
 Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that 
 I did a lot of dumb things in my past 
 Love will give me hope and I won’t relapse 
 Dave just bought a new nine eleven 
 Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash 
 Q just bought a brand new McLaren 
 Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects 
 Rashad got his son dripping in gold 
 Me? I’m ‘bout to let my hair down on hoes 
 Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes 
 Top billing that’s a million a show 
 Might blow the Whole Remy on Soul 
 Might tell Obama be more like Punch 
 Sounwave got a Grammy this year 
 Mack wop, but he do what he want 
  
 [Outro] 
 Level two, level two 
 No I’m not done 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 I could put a rapper on life support 
 Guarantee something that none of you want 
 Then hold me down and they yell something like 
 Rent is like twenty five hundred a month 
 What if I empty my bank out and skrrrt? 
 What if I empty my bank out and skrrt? 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one 
 You ain’t got, you ain’t got 
 You ain’t got, you ain’t got 
 Tell me that, tell me that 
 That, I am the One 
 You ain’t got, you ain’t got 
 You ain’t got 
 You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one 
 Yes, I’m the one[Verse 1] 
 Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching 
 Trigger finger itching 
 To trouble one of you niggas 
 I'm daring one of you niggas to jump 
 I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you 
 Then put you back in the trunk 
 Shit, I'm back in the front 
 The front page of the newspaper 
 They say I'm seeing more paper... true 
 But only if you knew that 
 I was in your house right now taking the  paper from you 
 Where ya safe at? 
 Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat 
 And catch it all like an umpire 
 I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car 
 Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires? 
 I don't know, just get inside 
 And never question my shit again ho 
 I fold dough like a notebook 
 I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look 
 Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook 
 That's what I'm hearing up in your song 
 Beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)[Skit] 
 You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake 
 How you want it dawg? 
 Closed Casket? 
 Remember that fool in a wheelchair? 
 How you think he got there? 
  
 [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I got my air-conditioning on right now 
 Real cool about it 
 Oil talking please 
 Slick with it 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Wanna know what death feel like 
 I suggest that you stay in the house at night 
 The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right 
 Plus my connect got a pretty good price 
 I could take off your neck with just one slice 
 Of the blade 
 No, I'm not Wesley Snipes 
 One cut can have her screaming out first aid 
 Been this way ever since first grade 
 Forte demeanour was to get paid 
 Birthday solution was to shoot straight 
 Thirteen I was ready for gunplay 
 Stand on the block taking pay 
 I get four shots like a freak oh he know 
 Not to fuck with K-D-O-T 
 Oh, I forgot 
 Never come around here without a Glock 
 You want beef with your boy 
 Nigga I put heat on your boy 
 Leave him tied up on the back seat 
 With your boy duct taped won't let out noise 
 Oh yes we got them toys 
 Oh yes we got them choppas 
 LAPD they can't stop us 
 Rockets shoot down helicopters 
 In the kitchen (in the kitchen) 
 Betty Crocker (betty crocker) 
 Got kick (got kick) 
 You hate (you hate) 
 You wait (you wait) 
 One sec (one sec) 
 I'll be back we then gon' west 
 No vest, I'ma aim at your face 
 Unless you can stop them 
 I'm so throwed 
 Oh yes people there is a problem

 [Hook: Z-Ro (kendrick lamar)] 
 (Know what I'm talking bout? 
 I can feel that lane 
 Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me 
 I'm so [?] too 
 You see they be loving the oil talk 
 Its real slick for them 
 I keep the air conditioning on 
 Cool, cool, cool) 
  
 [Verse 2: Emjae] 
 Pop shots yeah we kill niggas 
 On the real nigga 
 Run when I flex the steel 
 Coming with a [?] to grill niggas 
 Save on the ounce but don't know the price 
 But I know one time ain't bust late night 
 Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice 
 Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic 
 I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain 
 I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine 
 All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains 
 And when I leave I [?] your white carpet got a stain 
 Watch as my city get gritty 
 Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty 
 Domino effect when we spray them with the semi 
 Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me 
 Front to back 
 Stack for stack 
 Nigga go clip for clip 
 Either gat for gat (braaap) 
 Wise niggas better check my stacks 
 We let the match ratatat 
 And all the heads we crack 
 Stacked, lots of cheese 
 Tryna cop the gs

 Cop the keys 
 To the boss got rocks to feed 
 Roster fees 
 Cause ain't nobody stopping me 
 I got a flow so cold 
 Style so bold 
 A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole 
 Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4 
 And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole 
 West coast in motion 
 Promoting another episode 
 Down south them niggas get [?] whilst we be getting [?]Yo, this ya man Wiz Khalifa, yo La Leakers, where the fuck did y'all find this one? 
 I had that one zipped up with the good shit 
  
 Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world 
 So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl 
 In the midst of the smoke in the air 
 The reflection of lights that glare 
 She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare 
 And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance 
 Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon 
 Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring 
 We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus 
 That's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid 
  
 Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love 
 Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to 
 Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy 
 So eventually we'll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun) 
 Smoke like this 'til the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching 
 Then do it again 
  
 Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night 
 All seven days of the week, I live the party life 
 I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends 
 We going hard 'til the sun come up and do it again 
 I got a drink in my hand they playing my favorite song 
 This girl that's dancing on me ain't got no panties on 
 And she gonna come back to my hotel, don't tell 
 Anyone about us, I'm here to party all night 
  
 Come to my section (my section)

 The Winner: Taylor Merrifield.Kendrick Lamar: 
 What inspired me as a kid really was, uh, illustrating my thoughts on that sheet of paper 
  
 Life's to me like a box of chocolates 
 (?) something for something, that's the obvious 
 Flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Biting my style, you (?) 
 Come from the same blocks where they pick cotton 
 Oh, you forgotten, ah, forget it 
 That life ain't sane 
  
 You see gangbanging, drug paraphernalia. You see things from the streets. So what you gon' do? You gon' find something that you love to do and have a passion for it, or you gon' stay, you  know, mingling in the streets until something major happens 
  
 So the moment I defined myself and freed myself was the time I locked myself in the studio and said, "You need to do music." 
  
 Tonight's for everybody, understand me 
 The plan B is the one in your hearts 
 This here is family, Kendrick Lamar 
 Words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan 
 Marching on Rosecrans in Compton 
 You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit 
 I'm on point like period 
 I've been there and gone before you get near it 
 Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther 
 The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters 
 Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in 
 That's family, God and honor 
 From Chicago, my daddy and my momma 
 Came into Compton to accomplish one thing: reign supreme 
 Raise a king named Kendrick 
 I ain't lying, it stand for "King" and I am one 
 My unborn son and grandson will live royal 
 From the coochee to the soil 
 The meek shall inherit the Earth 
 Well, I've had this world since birth 
 Feel the good kid's hunger 
 The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger 
 But it's muscle in my heart 
 I stare in the eyes of Mozart and tell him I'm the genius 
 I love myself, really love myself 
 And I means this with all sole 
 And you can't control greatness 'less you hating 
 With the heart of Satan 
 But even that can't stop it 
 I tell 'em, "Get out my wallet and passion in your logic" 
 Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me 
 And if you say it ain't, you may offend me 
 Damn, that boy good 
 I'm bright as Thomas Edison but I'm Gucci Mane in the hood 
 I stood alone for so long, prolonged my whole career 
 But now I'm here, you can shoot shots and cheer 
 Because I am, we are Kendrick Lamar 
  
 Getting into that success level where you can go back to your neighborhood and people feel like, you know, uh, they look up to you. Sometimes the most riskiest things you can do can end up being, you know, the most important. Yeah

 My dream's more vivid than Dr. T's, (?) evolutionary

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am KendrickFrom the very heart of me 
 Belief becomes action 
 And no distractions will take my eyes off the prize 
 Greatness is my goal 
 But there's failure on the way 
 Full of insecurity, self-hate and doubt 
 But what I can't control can't confine me 
 And what I can't do can't stop me 
 This is how I express myself 
 Not how I follow others expectations 
 But how I stay true[Hook] 
 On my momma, I'm a get money all day 
 All night, somethin' like 24/7, on my momma 
 I'm a stay fresh all day, all night, somethin' like 24/7 
 On my momma, I'm a pull up 
 Hop out with two of them Top Models 
 Haters gon' hate, but before the ice grill, say, 'Stop 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels' 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 They'll say it's bizack for the first time 
 Young boy rhyme like '87 Rakim, locked in my own world 
 No fire hydrant can water down me though 
 I'm a tyrant on Swizz beats, it's kind of ironic 
 Roll up the chronic tree, Hennessy, let's see, can you get like me? 
 White tee, L.A. fitted, roamin' the backstreet 
 Back trunk, chopper clap back at me 
 Girls get skeet-skeet on like Little John 
 BME, I don't save 'em, even with coupons 
 Usually I kick game like modern-day Bruce Lee 
 Raw heat, never paranoid when ridin' on deep-dish rims 
 Fly as Clark Kent, invade the black like a martian 
 Then say, 'Pardon me, no, pardon my arrogance 
 If you don't learnt else about I 
 Then, motherfucker, you better know this' 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 On my momma, you want to look at my wheels, huh? 
 On my momma, you want to know how it feel, huh? 
 To get like me, makin' them dollar bills, huh? 
 Pull up, hop out wit' my appeal, huh? 
 On my momma, she lookin' to pop a pill, huh? 
 On my momma, she lookin' to get a thrill, huh? 
 She want to go home, get that punani killed, huh? 
 Face down, ass up, she know the drill, huh? 
 I got a couple of soldiers ready to ride, huh? 
 It pop off the club, we finna leave outside, huh? 
 We see you duckin' and dodgin', flippin' to hide, huh? 
 On my momma, you play 'round and lose your life, huh? 
 I'm funky-fresh all night, huh? 
 Smokin' that chronic, high as a kite, huh? 
 Drinkin' that brown bottle on site, huh? 
 Been pimpin', baby, swear I don't lie, huh? 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 You ain't got to front, homie 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 I said, 'You ain't got to front, homie' 
 Look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels 
 I ain't gon' lie 'bout it 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 Yeah 
 Punch what's happening brother? 
 Niggas be poppin' that shit to me like it's something new to me or something, I tell 'em bout 
 I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga 
 I've been doing this shit since vanguard[?] brother 
 Antonio what's happening with it? 
 Niggas hatin' on me but hop right on my dick soon as they see me 
 Soon as they see me they be like 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 What up Dot? 
 That's what they tell me every second around the clock 
 Every time I clock in, rappers checking they watch 
 Studio paid for, hours unlimited 
 Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll 
 How many God MCs I knock off they halo 
 Hip-hop ain't dead, consumers changed up 
 Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow 
 I stay low like my socks under my ankles 
 Play the back like a turtle shell, know well 
 That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit 
 So I fail, guess what? I don't even trip 
 Just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines 
 I did that in 99' you think it's a gold mine 
 When you think of one, you think you hot but I think you done 
 Like Queens New York slang, look what the killer brung 
 Machine guns to a fight, fucking right 
 Pay your bills or I'm turning out your lights, good night 
 I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings 
 'Till I drop like visine 
 Tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems 
 Like the stitching on swap meet jeans 
 I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper 
 Snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off 
 At ya 
  
 [Hook] 
 The real is back 
 Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap 
 They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts 
 Safe estate, they know where the best be at 
 Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?) 
 Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name 
 And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang 
 What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets, what chain? 
 I barely wear jewelry, so I ever had one 
 You barely see it on me, and if I ever had a gun 
 You wouldn't know it's on me, so snatch it and then you done 
 I'm in the studio just sipping on Parmesan 
 Thinking about who could fuck with Kenny and parlor sons 
 I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit 
 Probably catch four between your abdomen 
 Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabing with 
 Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses 
 New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit 
 But still we continue to drink laxatives 
 Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget 
 This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter? 
 Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo 
 Yup, you little monkeys know what it do 
 Come test me 
  
 [Hook] 
 The real is back 
 Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap 
 They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts 
 Safe estate, they know where the best be at

 And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang 
 What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle 
 And if you don't kill 'em then you send 'em to hospitals 
 Sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow 
 I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow 
 Bet I jumble to the end of my lifeline 
 So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time 
 The 08' Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch 
 Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause that's my bitch 
 I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick 
 The girl is mine, I don't know that hoe that you with 
 You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been 
 So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in 
 What's your motives? I bet it's to go against 
 Or like the GT get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets 
 I'm the all mighty K, Compton 
 Rep it 'till my very death day, let the reaper in his face 
 And recite every song from N.W.A 
 I pay homage for those great who paved the way 
 Wait, back to the subject of who's and who doesn't 
 Do what I do, bluffin' until I touch 'em 
 Like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me 
 But the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me 
 I'm a red bullet, small nigga 
 But I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall 
 NiggaGangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5 
 When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy 
 You have thought it was tender me on point like a widow P 
 Got that leverly give them dearies that do what it do 
 Payin a picture like duderline, you ain't shit but do do 
 In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you 
 You can hide, you get it if you want to 
 I do karate moves but the crushing tiger just might get broken down by a writer 
 Yeah the passenger hopped out 
 But you got shot by the driver 
 There's a killer like everywhere 
 So why would you take it there 
 Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared 
 That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banker you 
 Tell me f*ck you I'll tell you f*ck you back with my index finger 
 I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool 
 Keep it sober minded try not to be a p**sy like you 
 Nigga that kale cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break nigga 
 This is where it's at that's gangsta 
 Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5 
 I'm so malicious I blow your wicked 
 Make em close as stigiuos, hells kitchen I'm blowing dishes 
 This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poe and mission 
 I'ma lift it, my flow is gift it 
 She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches 
 Low the bisquits let's go to distance 
 I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broken mission 
 They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions 
 Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison 
 Call adrenaline I got this soul like a poe living 
 And.like I'm co-existent to prohibition 
 I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it 
 Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics 
 And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition 
 Show some recognition hold your .my pessimistic 
 Best that ever did it, Papoose is the definition

 Oh my God man, oh my God 
 We 'bout to shit on these faggots man 
 Check it 
 Yeah, K. Dot 
 *Let me get that* 
  
 [Verse] 
 First niggas used to rapping, get my attention 
 Now I don't even listen 
 It run through one ear and out the other 
 And I don't buy niggas records for music 
 I'm more interested in their album covers 
 I'm a talented brotha 
 Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick 
 Motherfuckers better listen when I spit 
 I knock records out the park 
 Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and I might Ken Griffey ya bitch 
 But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips 
 Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips 
 Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip 
 If you want, just ask for a clip 
 I'll give ya those for free 
 I won't charge a fee 
 Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves 
 Nobody can cut off the- 
 -number one rap artist 
 Damn, I am the hardest 
 Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges 
 To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it 
 Now people arguin' 
 Who is better? Them or him 
 Him referring to me 
 Them referring to the industry 
 Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown 
 Fuck later, I'm takin' it now 
 Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down 
 With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound 
 Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound 
 Straight for the dollas, 745 [?] Impala, scrapin' the ground 
 I suggest you follow, or not be smarter 
 Seein' another broke tomorrow 
 You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter 
 First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder 
 Ain't about money, then please don't bother 
 Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit 
 When I'm lookin' at ya like "Who are ya?" 
 Y'all niggas is gas 
 And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash 
 Y'all don't wanna see me spaz 
 Out, pull the gats out 
 And see me blast, ouch 
 You better off coppin' a pen and a pad 
 Than copyin' the last rhymes I had 
 And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "You wrote that?" 
 Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts 
 It don't matter 'cause in a minute, imma be chargin' my raps 
 A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that 
 I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track 
 Your whole budget, hoes love it 
 But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite 
 Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it 
 As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix 
 Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity 
 That's a whole 'nother planet 
 For real holmes, I do damage 
 Blow up ya city, even ya school campus 
 Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards 
 Let it blast 
 One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math 
  
 [Outro] 
 Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b 
 They have to call 911, I'm done 
 Dave, you feel me man? It's real 
 K. Dot man, just havin' a lil fun up here man 
 It's real ugly, ya know? 
 Yeah, bang, bang, let's go[Intro] 
 K. Dot 
 Dave

 [Hook] 
 Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you 
 Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you 
 Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you 
 Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you 
  
 [Verse] 
 Uh 
 Who's sick as me? 
 Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real 
 And as far as my eyes can see 
 I'm the only one fucking with me 
 Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf 
 And let real business get dealt 
 You ladies man like Leon Phelps 
 I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health 
 I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt 
 Your small mercy won't help 
 When shots circle around your waist like designer belts 
 I design your face, the [?] lift ya up 
 Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy 
 What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy? 
 It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years 
 Now it's back to the basics 
 K. Dot's nothing to play with 
 A nigga tried to test my gangsta 
 I pulled out a weapon and aced it 
 My grade point average at the top of the brackets 
 I'm sick like a cancer patient 
 Assist many players like personal agent 
 Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance 
 I'm the best now 
 Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows 
 Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns 
 'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words 
 I'm the best you heard today, hands down 
 So hand down whatever you had 
 Like you been in a bag 
 Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had 
 Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence 
 K. Dot, so heaven sentMR WINDY CITY WHO THE FUCK KENDRICK LAMAR YOU FROM CALI I AM FROM THE CHI WHERE THEY INVENTED MOB/YOU COPY SWAG LIKE YOU BETTER THIN R I GOT THIS WEIGHT ON MY CHEAST I AM JUST LIFTIN MY BAR,S AND MY EYES STAY RED LIKE THE ROCKS ON MARS I AM AT THE TOP OF MY ELITE I GUESS I AM TOUCHIN THE STARS WHAT YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS JAY Z BIGGIE OR NAS HOW YOU THE KING OF NEWYORK PLAYIN WITH THE WRONG COURT IF﻿ LIKE WAS A SWIMMIN POOL YOU DROWIN IN YOUR OWN SPORT[Verse 1] 
 I've been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches 
 One state of mind, I'm out for the riches 
 I've seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen 
 Now behind prison, phone calls can't visit 
 Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit 
 Rated R content, no supervision 
 With you talking nonsense, I'm not trynna listen 
 I'm a point guard, small forward, play your position 
 Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes 
 On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious 
 I switch the flow so you say that I sound different 
 But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing?? 
 And that's the same reason your not in my competition 
 Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing 
 Fall off is probably what you wishing 
 But I can't stop, won't stop, young gunning you niggas 
 I've been known to have stash for the burnnin 
 And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them 
 And when I get dough, I'mma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner 
 I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government 
 See me in the hooptie boy, it's not a cover up 
 See I'm a young black boy who don't give a fuck, what 
 This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit 
 Cock back and blast some shit 
 Empty, reload the clip 
 You won't find nothing hotter than this 
 Whatcha know about it 
 This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff 
 Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick 
 You won't find nothing hotter than this 
 Whatcha know about itDropped 40 for a Glock 40 that's a hood discount 
 That's an accessory gun, sesemy seed buns 
 For the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up 
 Fucked with the wrong fuck up 
 I've been a nut since pops fucked moms 
 Fucked up in the head, I'm living, but I'm brain-dead 
 Life goes on and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm 
 Niggas'll get you first where I'm from 
 That's why I Creep on 'em, I creep on 'em, I creep on 'em 
 Niggas play cool, put the heat on 'em 
 Make the temperature reach the highest peak on 'em 
  
 I said you don't need a pyschic in order to read my palmThis is special, man. As my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time—real talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop. 
  
 This is a special award because of rap music. This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was. 
  
 From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But it’s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I’m saying? Hip-hop has done that for me. 
  
 I got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar. 
  
 So with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. That’s love, baby. Jay for president![Verse 1] 
 K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, got mad heart 
 Come from Compton, I spit straight heart 
 Got my hood on for Trayvon Martin 
 Freedom, justice, you know we gon' be started 
 Get the party started every time we come through flippin' 
 Flamin' Hot Cheetos I'm eatin' 
 I'm skippin' across L.A., that's somethin' that we do 
 Each and every day, hangin' with my crew 
 Throw another word, watch how I observe the train 
 Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane 
 And when I say "train", that don't means that I flip her 
 Yeah, we did toss, turn just like Flipper 
 My favorite cartoon, you know 
 Got to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show 
 Tiny Toon Adventures, Dennis the Menace 
 I'm a menace, I spit, break the World of Guinness 
 When I'm flowin', you never know, I need another word 
 Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd 
 The Finals, the Heat, yeah, they came with the Heat 
 LeBron, Wade, no, they can't be defeat 
 I stay in the shade, I'm in the darkness, I'm hot though 
 Another word, homie, you give me what you got 
 Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies 
 The Hoovers in the streets, they try to shoot me 
 I move with heat, you never can stop me 
 I come from Compton, (?) 
 The best strip club, it's down Atlanta, it's down Miami 
 I stay with the (?), I say, "What's up, shawty?" 
 You got your girl, I don't like fake ass, I need a referral 
 I see everybody twerkin' 
 Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker workin' 
 You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show 
 I'm here, I'm here, I'm lettin' people know 
 The better celebrity female in the game 
 I like Rihanna, who else could complain? 
 I love, I can't even say the word 
 But I'm cussin' and I don't need to pronounce a verb 
 The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do 
 We stay in the booth, we do it, we shoot 
 We straight for the stars, you know just who we ares 
 We ride in Buicks, then we pushin' the flashy cars 
 I'm a flow all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show 
 Just to let you know, we still 'bout to go 
 They bring me in, they show love with the crew 
 Rickey Smiley Show, huh, you know what it do, what's up?[Intro] 
 I been a real one, I been a real one 
 I been a real one, I been a real one 
 I been a- I been a love and a travesty 
 Never talk down on no prophecy, put it on God, ain't no stopping me 
 Put it on God, God, God, God, God 
  
 [Hook] 
 I been a real one, I been a real one 
 I been a real one, I been a real one 
 I been a real one, I been a- 
 I been a love and a travesty, never talk down on no prophecy 
 Put it on God, ain't no stopping me, put it on God, God, God, God[Intro] 
  
 I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight 
 I'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios 
 I promise I won't tell baby girl 
 I can hold water, I promise 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I got this girl named Meagan Good 
 Well, you could say that Meagan was bad 
 The way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass 
 Like a quarterback Mr. McNabb 
 She introduce me to her friend Teairra Mari 
 Well, see Mari put a nigga to sleep 
 She made her boy feel good even curled my feet 
 Now please don't go back to Jay-Z 
 It's a rap, I used to fuck with Christina a while back 
 Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of em 
 They did this little trick with their tongue 
 I came faster than a NASCAR spinning backwards 
 Brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice 
 In the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress 
 Brooke Valentine like to take it from behind 
 Face down, ass up, shit I love it when she climb 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now we can all be celebrity cousins 
 And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' 
 Now we can all be celebrity cousins 
 And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else 
 I promise, I won't tell nobody else 
 I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else 
 I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know 
 Psych 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 And about Vivica 
 I had her way before 50 Cent start dissing her 
 One thing I know, shit I hope he wasn't kissing her 
 Man she could blow like a torch 
 And dick without using a fork 
 She introduced me to Gabrielle of course 
 Union, had her on my backyard porch 
 Legs up film rolling, action, cut 
 She looking at me like "what happened, get up" 
 [?] fucked up so Holly came 
 Shit I felt that I lucked up 
 Gave her my last name, Trina moved on 
 She fucking with Lil Wayne now 
 It's OK, I ain't crying about my hand-me-downs 
 I'ma sit back, take it for what it's worth 
 But for now I'm free, "can you please lift up your skirt?" 
 We can do lunch, later on be dessert 
 I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work 
 Out 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight 
 And Bow Wow wants to see my cars out the house 
 [?] nigga maybe wanted to fight 
 He seen the burner on the draw and walked right out 
 Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talkin' bout 
 I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada 
 Baby momma drama I start fucking Fantasia 
 Nothing serious, she thought of it as a favour 
 And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up 
 Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants up 
 The Pussycat Dolls want the fantasy of all 
 Like, I'ma need some help trying to fuck all of y'all 
 Hour later, that's when Amerie called 
 Saying "this just one thing" 
 OK ma, "you don't have to fiend for the ding-a-ling" 
 I'll be over there, make sure Eve over there 
 I wanna see y'all mingling together 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Remember that time at my house 
 Remember that time at your house 
 Remember that time on the bed 
 Remember that time on the couch 
 Remember that time on the chair 
 Remember when Nelly was downstairs 
 We all had a good time 
 Didn't we all have fun 
 As celebrities can we? 
  
 [Hook]I was 8 yrs old when I first saw you. I couldn’t describe how I felt at that moment. So many emotions. Full of excitement. Full of joy and eagerness. 20 yrs later I understand exactly what that feeling was 
 INSPIRED 
  
 The people that you touched on that small intersection changed lives forever. I told myself I wanted to be a voice for man one day. Whoever knew I was speaking out loud for u to listen 
  
 Thank you 
 K.L 
 September 13, 2015[Verse 1] 
 Oakland and 2Pac 
 I move oak, you see, I'm nothin' like [inaudible] 
 Thinkin' they hot cause they homies said they was a few times 
 Which is too many times of lyin' to you, they tellin' a lie 
 The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it 
 Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up 
 I bench press this rap stuff 
 Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key 
 My cool is on, she love my AC 
 My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all'd try ride me 
 I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys 
 We push the coupe like a [inaudible] 
 The helicopter's comin', realize there's nothin' behind us 
 Behind me, Your Honor 
 I fuck over these beats with no condom 
 This ain't rap, it's really a porno, rewind it back 
 [Inaudible], it's back to definin' a loss, correct, they don't obey 
 Y'all ain't nice, nigga, y'all just okay 
 Yeah, they're more than a little [inaudible] 
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes 
 [Inaudible] equivalent to the theme song of your career 
 Study my craft, you ignorant 
 I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration 
 Somethin' y'all never had 
 If my pockets is somethin' you tryin' to grab 
 See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab 
 You old news, old dudes, get out my way 
 Let the young boy come through, don't mention my age 
 Shit, I'm on a mission for pay 
 And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space 
 Look, you're not in my atmosphere 
 You can act like you're here 
 But actually you ain't accurate fuckin' with this music biz 
 The industry like, 'Fuck it, let the music be his' 
 No theme park, I'm not tryin' to amuse you kids 
 Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water 
 Do we really fuck with President Carter? 
 My reply's that I can't stay away from the bosses 
 Got the biddin' war poppin' like a auction 
 Five or ten labels like, 'What he hatin' for?' 
 Except the zeros and more 
 Remember havin' Aftermath sittin' on my door 
 Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm so far ahead of my time 
 I got people five years from now pressin' rewind 
 I'm hardly impressed with y'all 
 I hate rappers, where the true artists at? 
 If it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect 
 Often y'all arguin' about who got next 
 Claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet 
 Hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp 
 Try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where I'm at 
 Your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc' 
 You recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow 
 Your flow in the same place 
 Don't just [inaudible], expand 
 Try to be more creative, perhaps 
 My rap friends, I ain't sayin' that you wack, psych 
 Like a invoice, I'm just statin' the facts, right? 
 You'd have to count the metaphors I write 
 In fact, you've been a factor you've feared your whole life 
 No TV show, don't compare me with them 
 That's like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp 
 A Jordan versus Kukoč 
 A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino[Verse 1] 
 Fuck, watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm 
 I'll bomb if you don't feel 'em, piranhas in 'em 
 Feed my persona as I get deep as Nostradamus 
 No stallin' like the [inaudible], nuh-uh, [inaudible] 
 I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you're sleepin' on me 
 No promise, no peekin', homie 
 You're tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know 
 So I switch it quicker than my bitches 
 If they want your attention 
 One thing for sure, they gon' get it 
 I'm cursed with the world's negatives 
 Probably thinkin' I'm hurt, but that's the only way I can live 
 War, money, cash, drugs, got me feelin' like AIDS 
 Walkin' inside the club 
 Paid in full, it more be like [inaudible] 
 .38 snub huggin' my waist like it had arms 
 Then I bear it, so I guess it really does 
 No paperwork on this marriage 
 He love when life [inaudible] better than life 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Drunk off Paul, nigga, pourin' by the Rover, bitches 
 Pourin' hollows over haters, we killin' insecure niggas 
 Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas, old Big, new 'Pac 
 Oh my God, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects 
 Bombin' everythin' from the streets to the Internet 
 Hear the instrumental wet 
 Then I'm a bust a nut, yep, I'm a fuckin' nut 
 That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armored truck 
 Shoot who? Shot what? 
 You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump 
 Who you motherfuckers want? 
 Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump 
 He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk 
 Might be out in Houston, lean in my pimp cup 
 Ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put 
 Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL 
 In our new block, choppers on the rooftop 
 Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot 
 Strip a nigga from his Wade cap to his two socks 
 Got it from them Compton blocks 
 Raised from my grandpa's 
 Every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop 
 Goons in the parkin' lot 
 Who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana 
 Get killed right in front of your momma 
 Hold tight, coroner comin' 
 Summertime, perfect time for dove huntin' 
 And you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out 
 She climaxed and passed out 
 And promotional flyers, K-Dot be the flyest 
 Eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet 
 Straight up like a kangaroo 
 Pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black 
 This is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second 
 I'm a get it maybe here for a minute when I'm finished 
 Let's begin it[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I don't need the hype 
 They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction 
 No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing 
 You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton 
 Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac 
 I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys 
 Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot 
 Cause your homey said you you was a few times 
 Which is too many times 
 They lying to you, they telling a lie 
 The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it 
 Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up 
 I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs 
 I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C 
 My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me 
 I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (Isleys) 
 I push the coupe like a high speed 
 The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me 
 Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom 
 This ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back 
 Finally the finest of 'em all is back 
 To define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey 
 Y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK 
 You're nothing more than a little John phrase 
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes 
 Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career 
 Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad 
 Just inspiration: something you never had 
 If my pockets is something you trying to grab 
 I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab 
 You old news, you old dudes get out of my way 
 Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age 
 I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space 
 You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here 
 But actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz 
 The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his" 
 No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids 
 Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water 
 Do he really fuck with President Carter? 
 My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses 
 Got the bidding war popping like an auction 
 5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more? 
 Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door 
 Money in front of me, couldn't open the door 
  
  
 [Verse 2: Unknown rapper] 
 Boom! That's that, left him on his back flat 
 You talking like that, jack, spitting 
 About crack, but never been about that 
 I'm real with this rap, I'm just speaking the facts 
 Rap, but some niggas wack, talent something they lack 
 So gather your whole pack, I'm taking them off the map 
 My pockets is getting fat, their pockets, they staying flat 
 So imma just hollaback, they rocking their tiny J's 
 But niggas ain't getting paid in the spot, like they a slave 
 12 hours just for some change, man this shit a shame 
 When the feds come, who you gon' blame? But that's just 
 Learning the game, you niggas should do the same 
 They go as fast as they came, cause passing me you ain't gon' see 
 I go bar for bar, and b, you are just a target, b 
 So just call me Muhammed Ali 
 Easy shit be hard to do, easy for me and hard for you 
 I'm leaving you with the (?), pick up a broad, 'bout three or two 
 Life is like a puzzle but my level is some trouble, man, you gotta use your muscle, in the hood I had to tussle 
 Man, I'm moving to the shop, (?), man you're not 
 Niggas steady talking but barely looking in the spot 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind 
 I'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at? 
 If it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect 
 Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game 
 Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp 
 Try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at 
 Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre 
 You recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow 
 Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate 
 Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps 
 My rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche 
 Like an in-voice, I'm just stating the facts, right? 
 (?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor 
 You've feared your whole life, no TV show 
 Don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus Nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč 
 A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino[Corey Holcomb] 
 Yeah, yeah. So, y'all all curious. That's fine. That's fine, man. I'm – look, I'm a tell ya how ya boy, Moochie, landed his ass in this goddamn slammer. It was Kendrick. Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. 
  
 [Prisoner] 
 Yeah, right. This motherfucker. 
  
 [Corey Holcomb] 
 That's right. Shit was wild, goddamnit. 
  
 [Prisoner] 
 This motherfucker. 
  
 [Corey Holcomb] 
 We had a ball. Ay, nigga, you ain't gotta believe me, nigga. Goddamnit. 
  
 [Prisoner] 
 He's just talkin' about it. 
  
 [Corey Holcomb] 
 Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off. 
  
 ["These Walls"] 
  
 [Driver] 
 Kill these motherfuckers. You hear me? 
  
 [Back seat passenger] 
 I hear you. 
  
 [Driver] 
 Get that money and come out. 
  
 [Back seat passenger] 
 Man, you should a heard what this li'l' nigga was talkin', man. Talkin' so much shit on the block. Man, I been tryin' to tell ya. He talkin' 'bout he gon' get more money than me, he gon' get more money than you. I said, "Fuck this motherfucker, man. This li'l' motherfucker 'bout to get hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this motherfucker right now." 
  
 [Kendrick Lamar] 
 Man, Malcolm, shut the fuck up. We gon' go in here, get the money, get out. Simple as that. 
  
 [Back seat passenger] 
 But you ain't hear what he said. 
  
 [Terry Crews] 
 Nigga, I'm a smoke yo' ass. Now you fi'n' a get smoked, talkin' shit. What, bitch? What? What? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talkin' that shit. Where is this motherfucker? Nigga, fuck outta here. 
  
 [Dancer] 
 What the fuck, man? 
  
 ["Hit the Quan"] 
  
 [Terry Crews] 
 People can get murdered. Yeah. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. What? What? What? What? Pull him up. Uh. We 'bout to murder this shit.  Murder this. Murder that. Yeah. Murder that and this. Ha, we killin' this bitch. We killin' this bitch. We killin' it. Get the fuck up. Get your standin' on, niggas. It's a stand-on, motherfucker. Y'all ain't seen no shit like this. 
  
 [Corey Holcomb] 
 Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. [Laughs]. You hear what I'm sayin'? It was on, boy. I was barely standin' up by the end of it. Aw, yeah, it was cool, man. We was gettin' down, havin' a good time, dancin', groovin'. Everything was smooth. They was showin' your boy love. [Laughs]. But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me. 
  
 ["These Walls"] 
  
 [Corey Holcomb] 
 I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly. 
  
 ["These Walls"]I got i got i got 
 Motivation realization in my DNA 
 I got 
 Devotion and emotion in my DNA 
 Eyes open wide 
 Yeah we only want the prize 
 Standing ovation and celebration for our DNA[Backing Instrumental] 
 My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, "I need to be me goddamnit". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon' rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go[Produced by Sounwave] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin feet yüksekte yazdım 
 Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor 
 Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim 
 Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı 
 Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum 
 Hızlı gelen para ve özgürlük 
 Bir dolar için kaza kuklalığı, biliyorum onunla tanışmak için can atıyorsun 
 Muhtemelen bir dakika içinde öleceğim 
 Beni sadece 20 sürtük, 20 milyon ve üzerinde Compton yazan bir şapka ile gömün

 Bu sürtüğe geri döndüm, sürtüğün arkasında, arkam duvara dayalıyken ve senin kaltağın sikimin sınırlarında, kalk üstünden 
 Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim 
 Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım 
 Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir 
 Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim 
 20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam 
 Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim 
 80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm 
 Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum 
 Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin 
 2012'de kime güvenebilirim ki? 
 Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem 
 İkizler yardım çığlığı atıyor

 Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin feet yüksekte yazdım 
 Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor 
 Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim 
 Beni muhtemelen Osama Bin Ladin sanarlardı 
 Uçak acil iniş yaptı, bu benim için bir şereftiSaid I'm a fuckin monster 
 A massive attack will haunt ya 
 Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that 
 After that I went for thermometers 
 Popped them all then popped them in the jar 
 Tracy veronica holla back 
 They promise theres no pajamas 
 Insomnia when attack I attack like pirahana 
 Theres hit your block like a comet 
 And you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars 
 Calisthenics and silence is excersize 
 And that trigger strapped 
 Rock with us Metallica competition 
 No talent I'm in the jungle 
 Loud enough just might stumble 
 Upon a pack of lions no lying 
 My soldiers dying 
 This is like rap alliance is lining with 
 Stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying 
 Pressure a stretcher is needed paint prosthese of your living dead 
 Your stuff is a giga pet 
 You niggas can't see me unless you watchin that TV 
 Ill hold your hug in my silouette 
 My flow got the ceiling wet 
 I spit till I feel my breath start stinkin my fuckin chest 
 She fuckin the fuckin best mean my dick is the dick of death 
 Mean I'm killin that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip 
  
 Yeah dre 
 Me and Andre the giant 6’7” and climbin 
 Whether your storm to your climbin 
 Whether your beat makin a rhyme and 
 Bumpin some feelins huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans 
 Glasses, palmin’ asses that probably came with a great tan 
 I’ll be the motherfuckin mecca of this hub city spectrum 
 Where they at I will dissect them like a fuckin frogs rectum 
 While you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible 
 Probably call the federal after I slaughter several 
 Etcetera etcetera barely passin up celicas 
 Tellin us about shit 
 Hiii power in your mouth bitch 
 And top dawg can vouch bitch 
 Nigga what you bout 
 About face and army outfits the general’s head 
 Means the hustlers and the criminals there 
 Pinnotens reach the pinnacle of life in despair 
 And me I solemnly swear 
 To handle mine like a taliban and die for it 
 Only difference is I ain't never asked and I lie for it 
 Only difference is I be spazzin and still a pow for it 
 Put me in a category 
 I don't know whats a sadder story 
 Guts and glory your pain bore me 
 You ain't really lived it 
 I’ll take you to a block where they crippin 
 A piru that’s 5’2” gun bigger than the torso of pippen 
 Bitch I been doin it since before you niggas ruined it 
 Show me something different 
 You either kissin dick or givin me distance 
 You live in a district of dimebags and dummies 
 I know your statistics 
 Who your bar he more like my assistant 
 Get lost have an egg and a biscuit 
 Break-fast when we aimin them biscuits 
 Pay cash when your chain come up missin 
 Q, Q 
  
 [ScHoolboy Q:] 
 Ahh, double up said what the fuck 
 Give me some I’ll throw more poppin 
 Sagrets droppin soon they watchin 
 9s thats locked and load explode 
 Druggin ford I'm slowly known 
 Mary up some swisher sweets 
 LA nigga probably eats 
 Shrimp for the ragin beats 
 XO, henney, scrape the kief 
 Bangin c I’ll bang your beat 
 Put them niggas next to me 
 Stoppin for them give the lead 
 I'm here now let the hardest speak 
 All them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence 
 Still I'm ventin 
 Air condition coolest breezes, ill diseases 
 Grip my pen and shoot my semen 
 Still I'm coming 
 Mouths is runnin 
 I was learning gettin knowledge 
 And describin she a goblin 
 We be mobbin over bitches 
 Stickin missus she the business 
 Ghetto witness pussy frenchin 
 Just a mission poppin off like on a mission 
 Proposition gettin money drop a nigga 
 Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga 
 Cop a head gon bust nigga 
 Heatin up the winter nigga 
 Somethin to remember nigga 
 Hella sick I gotta spit 
 Curse with a verse like god told me kill this shit 
 Load a clip hecklin cops 
 The hoover king 
 Ba da bing by the dingaling 
 Natural hoover 
 Ving rhames with a vision clearer than visene 
 Asian from bejiing 
 Money making compton cream 
 Feed a weak thats when it stop 
 Start with rain drops 
 Autobots, space shuttle I'm shittin on your car lot 
 Boy stop 
 Could've at least got a saturn huh 
 Hiii power see a pattern huh 
 Puttin on chops like I've never been freed 
 Toon to the knees still I'm shootin up scenes 
 Cheese and a nigga thoughts succeed 
 Promising scenes ba da bing bing bing[Verse] 
 Tire marks, tire marks 
 Finish line with the tire marks 
 When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave 
 Ugh, walking on water and running on waves 
 God MC Oh my God you gotta see 
 There’s never no I's in me 
 Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away 
 Fire marshal's moving in 
 Marshmallows inside my pen 
 Sweet sixteens 
 Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin 
 I’m so appalled 
 With the prototype with a godly protocol 
 You an amateur, they wanna pro to call 
 I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada 
 I don’t care where ya are 
 Just blink twice and I’m there where you are 
 Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat 
 In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short 
 Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga 
 Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga 
 Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga 
 I had been around niggas, killas, pimps 
 You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch 
 Shoved off the porch when I was like six 
 Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6 
 Kick in the door 
 K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick 
 Momma in the bathroom poppa at work 
 Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church 
 Look at my shirt, Polo on it 
 It’s gon' sell if my logo on it 
 I fear no opponent 
 A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen 
 You looking at the 2010 Romans 
 Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD 
 And I spit like a HK 
 I’mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G 
 Problem and Hootie nigga 
 Tell the government come shoot me, nigga 
 Cause I’m going out with a fist raised 
 And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade 
 Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade 
 With a democratic politician from CA 
 They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K 
 Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ 
 Give us some free J’s put us in PJs 
 Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way 
 God-Damn, y'all cold 
 Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code 
 Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo 
 Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go 
 Although I’m in the land of milk and honey 
 Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain 
 All the niggas tried to take it from me 
 I had to fight back and shit 
 Get it back and shit 
 And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit 
 Like he back that shit 
 Acting like you real or something 
 Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar 
 Go pop some pills or something 
 You trying real hard to appeal to someone 
 I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub 
 With your BM in it and your stash box glove 
 And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help 
 I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself 
 I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt 
 I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like 
 Bla bla bla bla where the knife at? 
 Cut cut cut where your life at? 
 Your careers over, he’s slumped over 
 And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober 
 That's a new flow 
 Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo 
 New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer 
 Not a rapper, I’m a raptor 
 That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture 
 I’m a factor and your facial 
 I will fracture to a fraction 
 No one-half and I hate math 
 Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon 
 Took me mighty long to get here 
 Nigga, Fuck![Verse 1] 
 Uh, now tell me who it is 
 K-Dot, young kid runnin' the music biz 
 You tell me what's worse 
 Me bein' the best rapper or rappers dyin' of thirst? 
 I'm just like a gun-clapper with these words 
 And you know I'm packin' 
 And that word is meant for Janet Jackson 
 I'm a black hippy, that's what I know 
 I wear a heart black, I love peace, that's my clothes 
 And so, and I don't know this name 
 (Steve Buscemi, he's the actor, man) 
 Thank you for that ad-lib, G 
 Next thing you know, I google him up, it might be me 
 I hope he's rich, I hope he's contra 
 Band in my pocket, no, I don't have sponsors 
 Don't want the police to come in this place 
 Because I might run and I run this race 
 That's in the rap game 
 You got some more words, I go absurd 
 I got nouns, I got more verbs, this is the curb 
 I swing, my nigs, I flip flows 
 I come from the West, I do it the best 
 I don't stress, no contest 
 Any rapper want to come see with Rickey Smiley? 
 You can't see me, we creep up back of the alley 
 And beat they ass and take they cash 
 And then we stab, off in that Jag 
 I'm in, uh, celebrity crushes 
 I give 'em, they see me, I give them blushes 
 I'm talkin' Halle Berry, Stacey Dash 
 But she vote for Mitt Romney 
 No, I don't want that ass 
 I'm talkin' Obama, I'm talkin' more drama 
 This another word, your momma 
 Nah, that's Ebony Steele, that's me, for real 
 She got them long hairs, but she don't wear high heels 
 That means she's confident, that means she's beautiful 
 That mean she got no dirt in the cuticles 
 That means she got that watch 
 I mean, she got the shades 
 Shirley Caesar, left seat, man 
 After forty years, they'll sweep her in through the city 
 That's like me, that's like Jay Z, Pac and Biggie 
 That like me, that's like rappers don't know where I'm from 
 That's Compton, everybody don't want none 
 I got the people in the back straight cheerin' 
 I got the eyes wide open just like the deers in front of theI don't need no introduction 
 No ad lib on my name, 100 times for nothin' 
 You already know 
 It's K.Dot, city of Compton 
 Analogy is like Biggie [?] 
 Oakland and 2Pac, I'm more focused 
 I'm nothin' like these rap gods fumblin' over a few lines 
 Thinkin' they're high 'cuz their homies said they was a few times 
 Which is too many times of lyin' to you 
 You tellin' a lie 
 The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it 
 Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars up 
 I bench press this rap stuff 
 Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key 
 My cool is on, she love my AC[Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich 
 Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous 
 I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless 
 You don't know what pain is 
 How can I paint this picture 
 When the color blind is hangin' with you? 
 Fell on my face and awoke with a scar 
 Another mistake livin' deep in my heart 
 Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick 
 I can admit that it did look like yours 
 Why you resent every making of this? 
 Tell me your purpose is petty again 
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm tryin' to keep it alive 
 And not compromise the feeling we love 
 You're tryin' to keep it deprived 
 And only co-sign what radio does 
 And I'm lookin' right past you 
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles 
 You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror 
 I know what you scared of 
 The feeling of feeling emotions inferior 
 This sh- is vital, I know you had to 
 This sh- is vital, I know you had to 
 Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain 
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain 
 Rather a seasonal name 
 I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame 
 On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box 
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock 
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock 
  
 [Bridge] 
 I can feel the changes 
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous 
 You can see that my city found me 
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' 
 To you that's a quick check 
 With all disrespect, let me say this 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again 
 Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! 
 Things I don't understand 
 Sometimes I need to be alone 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 I can feel your energy from two planets away 
 I got my drink, I got my music 
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Outro] 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time 
 Don't you see that long line? 
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth 
 Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync 
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings 
 Now what you better do 
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive 
 My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution 
 Talk too motherf-in' much, I got my drink, I got my music 
 I say Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
 Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe! 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car! 
 Come on, we finna roll out! 
 I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD 
 Get yo' freestyles ready![Verse 1] 
 Live from the area code of 310 
 Carry the whole city on my back 
 Knapsack full of goodies, black hoodie, [inaudible] 
 Fully detach bullets from their own egos, see no evil 
 Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke 
 Summertime, wearin' a peacoat 
 I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus 
 Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage 
 Fabulous wordplay 
 And you can get served every day without a in-house maid 
 Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it 
 Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses 
 This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets 
 Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man 
 Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what? 
 Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight[Produzido por Terrace Martin] 
  
 [Intro: Darlene Tibbs] 
 Vai se foder, filho da puta, você é um arrombado 
 Eu não sei porque tenta ser grande, mano, você não é merda nenhuma 
 Andando como se fosse o presente de Deus para a terra, mano, você não é merda nenhuma 
 Você sequer compra pra mim uma roupa pro dia quatro de julho 
 Eu preciso daquela Brazilian Wavy de 28 polegadas, você está brincando 
 Eu não deveria estar fodendo contigo de qualquer forma 
 Eu preciso de um jogador, um chefão 
 Você é um negro "sem marca", todo mundo sabe disso 
 Seus parceiros sabem, todo mundo sabe 
 Vai se foder, mano, não me ligue mais 
 Você não vai saber, você vai perder uma boa mulher 
 Meu outro mano está ligado, você está desligado 
 Que porra que está pegando? 
  
 [Verso: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Este pau não está de graça 
 Você está olhando para mim como se não tivesse um recibo 
 Como se eu nunca tivesse bancado as despesas 
 Comendo suas sobras e sua carne crua 
 Este pau não está de graça[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Two emcees, that's all we need 
 This a freestyle off of the top, proceed 
 I come from the West 
 You know I gotta get 'em 
 Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester 
 Yes-ugh 
 As we rock from off the top 
 You know I got the sure shot 
 I make it hot 
 I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos 
 If you want to see me everybody say hello! 
  
 [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back 
 Tryna battle 
 I'll put your little ass in the saddle 
 How you don't see before 
 You can't see me 
 Never better emcee that's fucking shorter than me 
  
 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Yo, yo 
 I'm-ma use that mic 
 I'm-ma do that right 
 I'm-ma spit this all day and all night 
 Anybody wanna come under pressure? 
 Anybody wanna see God(?)-bless ya 
 I love ya 'fro, you got the head of the future 
 Rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, M.A.A.D. City) 
 I was there-ah 
 Now I had to switch it up and get the braids 
 Now I had to come through 
 Flow sicker than AIDS 
 I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid 
 I gotta come true, gotta be real 
 I gotta be proof, gotta be you 
 Gotta be us and gotta be due 
  
 [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Step up, emcee 
 If you want time right now 
 Come right now 
 And shine! (x6) 
  
 [Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Hold up! 
 I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars 
 It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars 
 It's not about the clothes, the hoes 
 Know who we are 
 It's all about the mentality 
 Love making chords 
 Your life makes you bruised and battered 
 But that don't matter 
 If you wanna know 
 Fuck all that chitter-chatter 
 Do your thing, let 'em sing 
 Let the gun-boy reign 
 Bite the sound, I just came and blazed 
 What's up![Bridge]

 Love, let's talk about love 
 Is it anything and everything you hoped for? 
 Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt) 
 I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt) 
  
 [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know 
 All the stars are closer 
 All the stars are closer 
 All the stars are closer 
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know 
 All the stars are closer 
 All the stars are closer 
 All the stars are closer 
  
 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Tell me what you gon' do to me 
 Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me 
 You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue 
 But you can't bring the truth to me 
 Fuck you and all your expectations 
 I don't even want your congratulations 
 I recognize your false confidence 
 And calculated promises all in your conversation 
 I hate people that feel entitled 
 Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you 
 Oh, you important? 
 You the moral to the story? You endorsin'? 
 Mothafucka, I don't even like you 
 Corrupt a man's heart with a gift 
 That's how you find out who you dealin' with 
 A small percentage who I'm buildin' with 
 I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin' 
 On my momma, that's the realest shit 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] 
 Love, let's talk about love 
 Is it anything and everything you hoped for?

 All the stars are closerOlhe toda a merda em que você se meteu 
 Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade (2x) 
  
 Mãe,remova essa porra de bloqueio 
 Eu tento falar com você todos os dias,mas bloqueio de chamadas 
 Nunca consigo,eu estou no caminho para ''sintomas de abstinência'' 
 Diga -me quem te disse que eu queria estar na porta 
 Para bater,eu só queria estar livre 
 Gostaria de saber se você pode deixar o seu salário 
 Para um advogado,eu posso dar a volta mas 
 Assim que eu sair daqui cada pacote será seu 
 Meu crédito está esgotado,eu preciso de ajuda 
 Não muito,eu vou lhe dar de volta o resto por mim mesmo 
 K.Dot me escreveu que matou Marcus 
 Se você me conhece sabe como me sinto mal 
 Keisha me criou falsas ilusões e nunca veio me visitar 
 E eu aprendi que uma outra folha preto 
 E os meus colegas me deixou no escuro,cego 
 Mãe volta pra mim pela última vez 
  
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Olhe toda a merda em que você se meteu 
 Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade 
  
 Mãe,remova essa porra de bloqueio 
 Até que chegou o dia em que ele removeu 
 Mas eles me deteram na mentira dentro do carro da polícia 
 Por favor,acredite em mim,isso não é fácil 
 Você parou de falar com o seu filho único 
 Lembra quando me colocou nessa carreira de relevos (que é a vida) 
 Eu competi,perseguindo sonhos de ser o melhor 
 Você me fez acreditar que um dia eu poderia ganhar 
 Tudo que eu preciso é você para me apoiar 
 A investigação da o mesmo relatório 
 De uma testemunha que pode testemunhar em tribunal 
 O promotor me ofereceu um acordo,ou perder 
 Mas eu não fui feito para todos esses números (tempo dentro da prisão) 
 Por Deus,fazer uma oração para minha mãe 
 Se puder,pelo menos desbloqueie sua linha telefônica 
 Mãe volta pra mim pela última vez 
  
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres

 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres 
 Olhe toda a merda em que você se meteu 
 Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade 
  
 Dante,eu fico estressado por ter que bloquear o meu número 
 Mas um dia o estado me fez fazer isso 
 Eu posso ajudar,mas não muito 
 Se bem a sí mesmo,conhecer seu próprio fulcro 
 Olhe para a sua reflexão e me diga o que você vê 
 Quem é a sua proteção? Deus 
 Esta não é uma rejeição , eu só aceito 
 Seu destino e o que vai acontecer 
 Lembre-se toda a noite como eu chorei 
 Pensando que meu único filho estava morto 
 Eles olharam pela janela ,por debaixo da porta 
 Veja fechado melhor do que morto 
 A única vez que você pensa que eu sou egoísta 
 Portanto, antes de assumir o posto , e colocar a Bíblia na minha mão 
 Filho , deixe-me dizer-lhe isto

 Onun kötülükleri ve günahları hakkında konuşabildiğimiz için memnunum 
 Tartışmak istediğim daha önemli bir konu var 
 Ronald Reagan çağının işlevsiz piçleri 
 Her şeyi kindar bir şekilde yapmayı öğrenmiş genç adam 
 Bu senin nesilin 
 Hızlı yaşa ve genç öl 
 Kim bu hikayeyi açıklamak ister?

 Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive) 
 From nine to five I know it’s vacant, ya bish (ya bish)

 A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish) 
 And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew) 
 Go at a reverend for the revenue

 It go Halle Berry or hallelujah 
 Pick your poison, tell me what you doin' 
 Everybody gon' respect the shooter 
 But the one in front of the gun lives forever 
 (The one in front of the gun, forever) 
 And I been hustlin' all day 
 This-a-way, that-a-way 
 Through canals and alleyways, just to say 
 Money trees is the perfect place for shade 
 And that's just how I feel, nah, nah 
 A dollar might just fuck your main bitch 
 That’s just how I feel, nah 
 A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with 
 That’s just how I feel, nah, nah 
 A dollar might just make that lane switch 
 That's just how I feel, nah 
 A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich 
 That’s just how I feel

 Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head) 
 He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish) 
 That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same) 
 A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain) 
 But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin') 
 Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin') 
 Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish) 
 Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish) 
 They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold) 
 And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

 Be the last one out to get this dough? No way! 
 Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way! 
 Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way! 
 Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

 Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do) 
 But for now I guess this sack will do (this sack will do)

 I got, I got, I got, I got— Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head This that put-the-kids-to-bed This that I got, I got, I got, I got— Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard I know how you work, I know just who you are 
  
 [Verse 2: Tots-Kray] 
 See, I was, I was, I was— 
 Cruising down the street when you were high on table tops 
 Dressing up like a damn idiot and fucking all those mops 
 Switching flows just like my hoes and no one ever told me stop 
 No one ever told me “Stop this shit, before I call the cops” 
 I just win again, and win again 
 There ain’t no misconception 
 All them other hoes who wanted dick was fucking, no exceptions 
 She destroying shit and killing shit with her only damn weapon 
 This shit is so crazy, I might give you a damn lesson 
  
 [Interlude: Tots-Kray] 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA 
 I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

 That girl, already met 
 All of this elegant

 [Verse 3: Tots-Kray] 
 You are irrelevant 
 You can not handle it 
 Tristan been shaking, ever since he handed it 
 I been so souping, no really, I felt like it 
 I’ve been saucing, looking at the damn tournament 
 Woo! 
 Fuck your family 
 Fuck your man 
 Fuck your peace 
 Fuck your girl 
 Fuck your friends 
 Fuck your ends 
 Fuck it man 
 Fuck anything you ever fucking liked fam 
 Cause I been living in a world of my own 
 No shit, in my zone 
 Just sitting in my home 
 Doing work, killing bones 
 You talking shit on your phone 
 I’ll beat you to death with a damn cone 
 Pass all this bullshit 
 My life wasn't build up like a tool kit 
 Fuck all the writers who used shit 
 Ima let it slide, better pass one 
 Go to the past one 
 Drizzy get the loot, he a fast one 
 Make one, take one 
 Boy you better snake one 
 Deciding on all the people, you a fake one 
 I might trace one 
 If a damn nigga got A1 
 Yes, I might as well take some 
 Preach! Get all of the fuckers you tryna reach 
 Walking up and down the motherfucking streets 
 They be biting like a damn motherfucking leech 
 All them damn bitches be something you wanna keep 
  
 [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] 
 I ain’t gotta get still 
 I ain’t gotta get still 
 Just live your life 
 Get outta mine 
 Why is this so bad 
 Fucking with your dad 
 Just live your-As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So it's only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life. 
  
 I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, "Where would I be if I didn't had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me what's right and what’s wrong?" Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brother's Keeper by being a mentor in real life.

 Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak 
 You know stress carries on, now your kids reap the mistakes that you made 
 And...

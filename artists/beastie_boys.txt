 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
  
 [Verse 1: Mike D] 
 Well, now, don't you tell me to smile 
 You stick around, I'll make it worth your while 
 Got numbers beyond what you can dial 
 Maybe it's because I'm so versatile 
 Style, profile 
  
 [Verse 2: Ad-Rock] 
 I said it always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child" 
 From The Hudson River out to the Nile 
 I run the marathon 'til the very last mile 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA] 
 Well, if you battle me, I will revile 
 People always saying my style is wild 
 You've got gall, you've got guile (guile) 
 To step to me, I’m a rapophile 
  
 [Verse 4: Mike D] 
 If you wanna battle, you're in denial 
 Coming from Uranus to check my style 
 Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial 
 Cast you off into exile 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
  
 [Verse 5: Ad-Rock] 
 Jazz and AWOL, that's our team 
 Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene 
 When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend 
 I like my sugar with coffee and cream 
  
 [Verse 6: MCA] 
 Well, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam 
 Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean 
 Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen 
 Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme 
  
 [Verse 7: Mike D] 
 Mario C likes to keep it clean (clean) 
 Goin' to shine like a sunbeam 
 Keep on rapping, cause that's my dream 
 Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes 
  
 [Verse 8: Ad-Rock] 
 Now when it comes to envy, ya'll is green 
 Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine) 
 Another dimension, new galaxy 
 Intergalactic planetary 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
  
 [Verse 9: MCA] 
 We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop 
 Kick off your shoes and relax your socks 
 The rhymes will spread just like a pox 
 'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock 
  
 [Verse 10: Mike D] 
 I am known to do the wop (wop) 
 Also known for the Flintstone Flop 
 Tammy D getting biz on the crop (crop) 
 Beat-see Boys known to let the beat 
 "MMM, D-r-r-rop!" 
 Do it 
  
 [Verse 11: Ad-Rock] 
 Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop 
 If my rap's soup, my beats is stock 
 Step from the table when I start to chop 
 I'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock 
  
 [Verse 12: MCA] 
 If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked 
 I'll stir fry you in my wok 
 Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop 
 Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
 Another dimension, another dimension 
  
 [Outro] 
 Do it[Verse 1] 
 I can't stand it, I know you planned it 
 I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate 
 I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here 
 Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear 
 So while you sit back and wonder why 
 I got this fuckin' thorn in my side 
 Oh my god, it's a mirage 
 I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 So, so, so, so listen up, cause you can't say nothin' 
 You'll shut me down with a push of your button 
 But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone 
 I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Cause what you see, you might not get 
 And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet 
 Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage 
 I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Whhhhhyyyyyy 
 (Our backs are now against the wall) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage 
 Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage 
 Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage 
 Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I can't stand it, I know you planned it 
 I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate 
 But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place 
 Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face 
 But make no mistakes and switch up my channel 
 I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle 
 What could it be -- it's a mirage 
 You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage[Intro: Ad Rock] 
 To Mario C—you can't front on that 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad Rock] 
 Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris 
 You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris 
 You know I get fly, you think I get high 
 You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why 
  
 [Verse 2: Mike D] 
 So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing 
 The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen 
 In my head, I just want to take 'em down 
 Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA] 
 Let it flow like a mud-slide 
 When I get on, I like to ride and glide 
 I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all 
 I get props at my mention cause I vex, y'all 
  
 [Verse 4: Ad Rock] 
 So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?) 
 I get so funny with my money that you flaunt 
 I said, "Where'd you get your information from," huh? 
 You think that you can front when revelation comes? 
  
 [Hook:] 
 (Yeah, you can't front on that) 
  
 [Verse 5: Mike D] 
 Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man 
 I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah) 
 You scream and you holler, about my Chevy Impala 
 But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar 
  
 [Verse 6: MCA] 
 But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping 
 Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping 
 Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall 
 Well I'll be calling out you people like a casting call 
  
 [Verse 7: Ad Rock] 
 Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride 
 With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by 
 Believe me, what you see is what you get 
 And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet 
  
 [Verse 8: Mike D] 
 Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time 
 This time I'm losing my mind; that's right 
 I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time 
 This time, I'm losing my mind 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Yeah, you can't front on that 
  
 [Verse 9: MCA] 
 But little do you know about something that I talk about 
 I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout 
 But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise 
 I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize 
  
 [Verse 10: Ad Rock] 
 Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all 
 I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall 
 I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want) 
 I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want) 
  
 [Verse 11: Mike D] 
 Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce 
 So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount 
 See I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner 
 I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena 
  
 [Verse 12: MCA] 
 Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce 
 You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause 
 But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease 
 I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Yeah, you can't front on that 
  
 [Outro:] 
 So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want) 
 So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want) 
 I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want) 
 I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys] 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)] 
 Now here's a little story I've got to tell 
 About three bad brothers you know so well 
 It started way back in history 
 With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D 
 Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere 
 Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer 
 Riding across the land, kicking up sand 
 Sheriff's posse on my tail 'cause I'm in demand 
 One lonely Beastie I be 
 All by myself without nobody 
 The sun is beating down on my baseball hat 
 The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat 
 Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy 
 His name was MCA, I said howdy, he said hi 
  
 [Verse 2: Ad-Rock, MCA] 
 He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed 
 Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst 
 The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip 
 His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip 
 He said, "Can I get some?" – I said, "You can't get none!" 
 Had a chance to run but he pulled out his shotgun 
 Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead 
 He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said 
 Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill 
 I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill 
 Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? 
 I run this land, you understand? I made myself clear? 
 We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin 
 You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin 
  
 [Verse 3: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)] 
 Now I got the gun, you got the brew 
 You got two choices of what you can do 
 It's not a tough decision as you can see 
 I can blow you away or you can ride with me 
 I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border 
 The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter 
 I did it like this, I did it like that 
 I did it with a wiffleball bat 
 So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun 
 And right about now it's time to have some fun 
 The King Ad-Rock, that is my name 
 And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne 
 We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot 
 The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot 
 This dude was staring like he knows who we are 
 We took the empty spot next to him at the bar 
 MCA said, "Ayo, you know this kid?" 
 I said I didn't, but I knew he did 
 The kid said, ("Get ready 'cause this ain't funny 
 My name's Mike D and I'm about to get money") 
 Pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky 
 He yelled ("Stick 'em up!") and let two fly 
 Hands went up and people hit the floor 
 He wasted two kids that ran for the door 
 ("I'm Mike D and I get respect 
 Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect") 
 MCA was with it and he's my ace 
 So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face 
 The piano player's out, the music stopped 
 This boy had beef and he got dropped 
 (Mike D grabbed the money) MCA snatched the gold 
 I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold[Chorus] 
 No sleep till 
 Brooklyn 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA] 
 Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal 
 Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle 
 My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time 
 City to city, I'm running my rhymes 
 On location, touring around the nation 
 Beastie Boys always on vacation 
 Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable 
 I do what I do best because I'm illing and able 
 Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking 
 Going coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking 
 While you're at the job working nine-to-five 
 The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live 
  
 [Chorus] 
 No sleep till 
 Another plane, another train 
 Another bottle in the brain 
 Another girl, another fight 
 Another drive all night 
  
 [Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock] 
 Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust 
 He's got his own room at the back of the bus 
 Tour around the world, you rock around the clock 
 Plane to hotel, girls on the jock 
 We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style 
 Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while 
 Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door 
 MCA's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore 
 We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack 
 With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back 
 White boys got more rhymes 
  
 [Chorus] 
 No sleep till 
 No sleep till Brooklyn 
 No sleep till Brooklyn 
  
 [Ad-Lib: Ad Rock] 
 Ain't seen the light since we started this band 
 So, MCA, get on the mic, my man! 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad Rock] 
 Born and bred Brooklyn USA 
 They call me Adam Yauch but I'm MCA 
 Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon 
 I sip the def ale with all the fly women 
 Got limos, arena, and TV shows 
 Autograph pictures and classy hoes 
 Step off, Holmes, get out of my way! 
 Taxing little girlies from here to L.A. 
 Waking up before I get to sleep 
 'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week 
  
 [Chorus] 
 No sleep till 
 No sleep till Brooklyn 
 No sleep till Brooklyn 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah) 
  
 [Outro] 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn) 
 No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)[Intro: Ad-Rock] 
 And on the cool check-in 
 Center-stage on the mic 
 And we puttin' it on wax; 
 It's the new style 
  
 [Verse 1: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D] 
 Four and three and two and one (What up?) 
 And when I'm on the mic—the suckers run (Word!) 
 Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D, and you ain't 
 And I got more juice than Picasso got paint 
 Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick 
 I'm not surprised you're on my dick (Mike D!) 
 B-E-A-S-T-I-E 
 What up, Mike D? 
 Aw—yeah—that's me 
 I got franks and pork and beans 
 Always bust the new routines 
 I get it, I got it, I know it's good 
 The rhymes I write—you wish you would 
 I'm never in training, my voice is not straining 
 People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining 
 So I went into the locker room during classes 
 Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses 
 You're from Secaucus—I'm from Manhattan 
 You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin' 
  
 [Chorus: Sample + Beastie Boys] 
 ("There it is") 
 Kick it! 
  
 [Verse 2: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D] 
 Father to many—married to none 
 And in case you're unaware; I carry a gun (Word) 
 Stepped into the party—the place was over-packed 
 Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy and shot him in the back 
 Man, I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped 
 You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped 
 I got money in the bank—I can still get high 
 That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly 
 I've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed 
 Their father had envy so I shot him in the head 
 If I played guitar, I'd be Jimmy Page 
 The girlies I like are underage (Shh! Check it) 
 Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like 
 I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike 
 My father—he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green (What up?) 
 I've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been 
  
 [Chorus: Sample + Beastie Boys] 
 ("There it is") 
 Kick it! 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D + Beastie Boys] 
 You wanna know why? Because I'm— 
 October 31st, that is my date of birth 
 I got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf 
 Taxing all females, from coast to coast 
 And when I get my fill, I'm chilly most 
 We ragtag girlies back at the hotel 
 And then we all switch places when I ring the bell 
 I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best 
 But I'm fly at Fatburger when—when he's—I'm way out west (Check it) 
 Check; K-I-N-G A-D—whammy! 
 All the fly ladies, they're on my jammy 
 Went to the prom—wore the fly, blue rental 
 Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental 
 I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt 
 I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt (Check it) 
 Spent some bank—I got a high powered jumbo 
 Rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and I watched Columbo 
  
 [Interlude: MCA + Ad-Rock] 
 Let me clear my throat 
 Kick it over here, baby pop 
 And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat— 
 Mmm—drop 
  
 [Bridge: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D + Beastie Boys] 
 Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's day 
 Just me, my posse, and—MCA 
 A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin' 
 .22 automatic on my person 
 Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger 
 My posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger 
 Some voices got treble—some voices got bass 
 We got the kind of voices that are in your face 
 Like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun 
 Like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum 
 I'm the King of the Ave.—and I'm the king of the block 
 Well, I'm MCA—and I'm the King Ad-Rock 
 Well, I'm Mike D—I got all the fly juice 
 On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce 
 Walking down the block with the fresh, fly threads 
 Beastie Boys—fly the biggest heads 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho... 
 Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho... 
 Brooklyn, ho 
 Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...[Intro] 
 Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin? 
  
 [Verse 1: MCA] 
 All you Trekkies and TV addicts 
 Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static 
 All you Klingons in the fucking house 
 Grab your backstreet friend and get loud 
 Blowin' doors off hinges 
 I'll grab you with the pinchers 
 And no, I didn't retire 
 I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers 
  
 [Verse 2: Mike D] 
 Like Mutual of Omaha 
 Got the ill boat you've never seen before 
 Glidin' in the glades 
 And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid 
 Like caprese and with the basil 
 Not goofy like Darren or Hazel 
 I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night 
 With classics rerunning that you know all right 
  
 [Verse 3: Ad Rock] 
 Now remain calm, no alarm 
 'Cause my farm ain't fat 
 So what's up with that? 
 I've got friends and family that I respect 
 When I think I'm too good, they put me in check 
 So believe when I say I'm no better than you 
 Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true 
 Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop 
 Guaranteed to make your body rock 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 What-wha-what-what-what's it all about 
 Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this muthafucking party out 
  
 [Verse 4: Mike D] 
 I said, "Doc, what's the condition? 
 I'm a man that's on a mission" 
 He said, "Son, you'd better listen 
 Stuck in your ass is an electrician" 
 Like a scientist 
 Mmm, when I'm applying this 
 Method of controlling my mind 
 Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined 
  
 [Verse 5: Ad Rock] 
 Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal? 
 I didn't know you go for that mass appeal 
 Some call it salugi, some hot potato 
 I stole your mic, but you won't see it later 
 'Cause I work magic like a magician 
 I add up, the mathematician 
 I'm a bank cashier, engineer 
 I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer 
  
 [Verse 6: MCA] 
 Shazam and abracadabra 
 In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya 
 Yo, money, don't chump yourself 
 Put that shit back on the shelf 
 Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing 
 We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 What-wha-what-what-what's it all about 
 Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this motherfucking party out 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
  
 [Verse 7: Ad Rock] 
 Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock 
 I don't wear a cup nor a jock 
 I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre 
 Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?) 
 I am the one with the clientele 
 You say, "Ad-Rock, you rock so well" 
 I've got class like pink champale 
 MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale 
  
 [Verse 8: MCA] 
 Don't test me, they can't arrest me 
 I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty 
 You look upset, yo, calm down 
 You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown 
 I flow like smoke out a chimney 
 You never been me 
 You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B 
  
 [Verse 9: Mike D] 
 Get your clothes right out the dryer 
 Put Armor All up on your tire 
 Sport that fresssssh attire 
 Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire 
 Set the town ablaze 
 Gonna stun and amaze 
 Ready to throw a craze 
 Make your granny shake her head and say "those were the days" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
 What-wha-what-what-what's it all about 
 Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this motherfucking party out[Intro] 
 Kick it! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go 
 You ask your mom please, but she still says no 
 You missed two classes and no homework 
 But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk 
  
 [Refrain] 
 You gotta fight for your right to party 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Your pop caught you smoking, and he said: "No way!" 
 That hypocrite smokes two packs a day 
 Man, living at home is such a drag 
 Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!) 
  
 [Refrain] 
 You gotta fight for your right to party 
 You gotta fight 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear 
 I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair 
 Your mom busted in and said, “What's that noise?" 
 Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys 
  
 [Refrain] 
 You gotta fight for your right to party 
 You gotta fight for your right to party 
  
 [Outro] 
 Parrrrrrty 
 Parrrrrrty 
 Yeah![Hook: Beastie Boys] 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Mike D, come and rock the sure shot 
  
 [Verse 1: Mike D] 
 I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo 
 I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu 
 I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah) 
 And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey 
  
 [Verse 2: Ad-Rock] 
 Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3 
 If you want a doody rhyme, then come see me 
 I've got the savior faire with the unique rhymin' 
 I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA] 
 Strictly handheld is the style I go 
 Never rock the mic with the pantyhose 
 I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go 
 ‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario 
  
 [Verse 4: Mike D] 
 You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak 
 To all the party people that are on my Bozac 
 I've got more action than my man, John Woo 
 And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah) 
  
 [Hook: Beastie Boys] 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 You know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot 
  
 [Verse 5: Ad-Rock] 
 Hurra-, Hurra- 
 Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums 
 Listen everybody cause I'm shifting gears 
 I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs 
 And on the microphone, I come correct 
  
 [Verse 6: MCA] 
 Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop 
 Top notch is my stock on the soapbox 
 I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs 
 And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee) 
  
 [Verse 7: Mike D] 
 I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it 
 I gotta straighten my thoughts 
 I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit 
 Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes 
 I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate 
  
 [Verse 8: Ad-Rock] 
 Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on 
 Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone 
 I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard 
 Never quittin', so won't you listen 
  
 [Hook: Beastie Boys] 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 MCA, come and rock the sure shot 
  
 [Verse 9: MCA] 
 I want to say a little something that's long overdue 
 The disrespect to women has got to be through 
 To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends 
 I want to offer my love and respect to the end 
  
 [Verse 10: Mike D] 
 Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking 
 But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking 
 So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV 
 I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD 
  
 [Verse 11: Ad-Rock] 
 Well, I'm that kid in the corner all fucked up and I wanna 
 So I'm gonna (yeah) take a piece of the pie 
 Why not, I'm not quittin' 
 Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in 
  
 [Verse 12: MCA] 
 I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic 
 I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic 
 To send my rhymes out to all the nations 
 Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication 
  
 [Hook: Beastie Boys] 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop 
 Keep on and rockin' the sure shot 
  
 B-boys, b-girls... 
 Tick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock[Q-Tip] 
 One-two, one-two, keep it on 
 Listen to the shit because we kick it 'til dawn 
 Listen to the Abstract, got it going on 
 Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn 
 On your eggs, then you go up the river 
 Listen to the abstract, that freaky nigga 
  
 [Ad Rock] 
 Now I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock 
 And I can't stop with the body rock 
  
 [Mike D] 
 See, I've got heart like John Starks 
 Hitting mad sparks 
 Pass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park 
  
 [MCA] 
 Well, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must 
 The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust 
  
 [Q-Tip] 
 And my Moms is not butt, but fuck it 
 Let me get down to the rhythm 
 Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism 
 Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga 
 Listen to the shit cause I am the ill figure 
 Nobody's getting any bigger than this 
  
 Get it together 
 Get... 
 Phone is ringing, oh my God 
 Get it together, see what's happening 
  
 [Q-Tip] 
 Ad Rock's down with the Ione 
 Listen to the shit cause both of them is bony 
 Gotta do it like this, like Chachi And Joanie 
  
 [Ad Rock] 
 Cause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni 
 So why all the fight and why all the fuss? 
 'Cause I ain't got no dust 
 Yeah, you know I'm getting silly 
 Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member 
 Born on the cusp in the month of November 
 I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember 
 Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender 
  
 [MCA] 
 Well, I'm long gone, word is bond 
 Don't need a motherfuckin' fool to tell me right from wrong 
 I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard 
 But I'm-a drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard 
  
 [Ad Rock] 
 And I be working on my game 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Because life is taxing 
  
 [MCA] 
 Gotta get it together 
  
 [All 3] 
 And see what's happening 
  
 Get it together 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Get it together 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Get it together 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 S-see what's happening 
  
 I go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark 
 But I had to do the shit, just let me embark 
 On the lyric and the noun and the verb 
 Let me kick the shit off cause, yo, I'm not the herb 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare 
 The Moog with the funk for your derriere 
 While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention 
 When it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing 
  
 [MCA] 
 Spacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and 
 My brain is roamin' and I don't know where it's goin' 
 Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?) 
 I gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah) 
  
 [Ad Rock] 
 Well, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio 
 And when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go 
 So, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for? 
  
 [Q-Tip] 
 Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme 
 And when MCs come in my face, I'm like mace 
 Because I back them off with the quills 
 Cause I tell you, nigga', cause I'll keep you under prills 
 Resting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah) 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Well I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn 
 Yeah, MCA, your shit be cookin' 
  
 [MCA] 
 Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat 
 But, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet? 
  
 [Q-Tip] 
 Got the Timbos on the toes and this is how it goes 
 Oh, one-two, oh my god 
 One-two, oh my god 
  
 [Mike D] 
 I got some shit 
 I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit 
 Never, ever, ever smoking crack 
  
 [Q-Tip] 
 Never, ever, ever fucking wack 
 I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters 
 Listen to me now, don't listen to me later 
 Fuck it, cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real 
 But, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel 
  
 Gonna get it together, watch it 
 Gonna get it together, Ma Bell 
 I'm like Ma Bell, Got the ill communication 
 Ma Bell, Got the ill communication 
 Ma Bell, Got the ill communications (Who's that?) 
 Ma Bell, Got the ill communication (word 'em up, word-word 'em up) 
 Ma Bell 
 Keep it on and on and on...[Produced by Rick Rubin] 
  
 Girls – all I really want is girls 
 And in the morning it's girls 
 'Cause in the evening it's girls 
  
 I like the way that they walk 
 And it's chill to hear them talk 
 And I can always make them smile 
 From White Castle to the Nile 
  
 Back in the day 
 There was this girl around the way 
 She liked my home-piece MCA 
 He said he would not give her play 
 I asked him, "Please?" – he said, "You may." 
 Her pants were tight and that's ok 
 If she would dance, I would DJ 
 We took a walk down to the bay 
  
 I hope she'll say 
 "Hey, me and you should hit the hay!" 
 I asked her out, she said "No way!" 
 I should've probably guessed her gay 
 So I broke North with no delay 
 I heard she moved real far away 
 That was two years ago this May 
 I seen her just the other day 
 Jockin' Mike D. to my dismay 
  
 Girls – to do the dishes 
 Girls – to clean up my room 
 Girls – to do the laundry 
 Girls – and in the bathroom 
 Girls – that's all I really want is girls 
 Two at a time – I want girls 
 With new wave hairdos – I want girls 
 I ought to whip out my – girls, girls, girls, girls, girls![Hook] 
 Brass Monkey - that funky Monkey 
 Brass Monkey junkie 
 That funky Monkey 
 Brass 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Got this dance that's more than real 
 Drink Brass Monkey, here's how you feel 
 You put your left leg down, your right leg up 
 Tilt your head back, let's finish the cup 
 M.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can 
 Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan 
 We're offered Moët, we don't mind Chivas 
 Wherever we go, with bring the Monkey with us 
 Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D. is D 
 Double R foots the bill most definitely 
 I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well 
 I got a Castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell 
  
 [Hook] 
 Brass Monkey- that funky Monkey 
 Brass Monkey junkie 
 That funky Monkey 
 Brass 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Because 
 'Cause I drink it anytime and anyplace 
 When it's time to get ill - I pour it on my face 
 Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice 
 Come on, y'all, it's time to get nice 
 Coolin' by the lockers, getting kind of funky 
 Me and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey 
 This girl walked by, she gave me the eye 
 I reached in the locker, grabbed the Spanish Fly 
 I put it with the Monkey, mixed it in the cup 
 Went over to the girl, "Yo baby, what's up?" 
 I offered her a sip-sip, the girl she gave me lip-lip 
 It did begin, the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip 
  
 [Hook] 
 Brass Monkey - that funky Monkey 
 Brass Monkey junkie 
 That funky Monkey 
 Brass 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Step up to the bar, put the girl down 
 She takes a big gulp and slaps it around 
 You take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it 
 We had a case in the place and we went right through it 
 You got a dry Martini, you thinking you're cool 
 I'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool 
 I'll down a '40 dog in a single gulp 
 And if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp 
 Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin' 
 Def-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin' 
 The song and dance keeping you in a trance 
 If you don't buy my record, I got my advance 
 I drink it, I think it, I see it, I be it 
 I love Brass Monkey but I won't give D it 
 We got the bottle, you got the cup 
 Come on everybody let's get ffffff 
  
 [Hook]

 Brass Monkey junkie 
 That funky Monkey 
 BrassNow, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat 
 I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat 
 A lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic 
 They'll be staring at the radio, staying up all night 
 So like a pimp, I'm pimpin' 
 I got a boat to eat shrimp in 
 Nothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin' 
 Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float 
 My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat 
 "Ooh-ooh" is my disco call 
 MCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all 
 Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write 
 And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night 
 Like eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man 
 I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes 
 You heard my style, I think you missed the point 
 It's The Joint! 
  
 Mike D... (Yeah?) With your bad self running things 
 What's up with your bad breath onion rings 
 Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead 
 Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med 
 Make another record 'cause the people they want more of this 
 Suckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz 
 Hurricane, you got clout 
 Other DJ's, he'll put your head out 
 A puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme or do my thing 
 I'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel 
 I might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well 
 The Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango 
 Got more rhymes than Jamaica got Mango 
 I got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a 
  
 Shake your rump-a 
  
 A full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all 
 And when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all 
 A full clout 
  
 Just like this 
  
 *sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise* 
  
 Never been dumped, cause I'm the most mackinest 
 Never been jumped, cause I'm known the most packinest 
 Yeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief 
 And if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith 
 Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat 
 Like Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet 
 Should I have another sip? Nah, skip it 
 In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet 
 Rope a dope dookies all around the neck 
 Who-ha, got them all in check 
 Running from the law, the press, and the parents 
 Is your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence 
 From downtown, Manhattan, the Village 
 My style is wild, and you know that it still is 
 Disco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump 
  
 Shake your rump-aNow here we go dropping science, dropping it all over 
 Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover 
 Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters 
 Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs 
 Naugles, Issac Newton, a scientific EZ 
 Ben Franklin with the kite, gettin’ ova with the key 
 Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables 
 Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables 
 Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge 
 An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college 
 Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat 
 I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet 
 Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared 
 Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared? 
 It's the sounds...of science, the sounds...of science 
  
 (Ad Rock) 
 Rope-a-Dope! 
 The newest in new, "Right up to your face and diss you" 
 Waxin' and milkin' 
 All of y'all square heads 
  
 Time and money for girls covered with honey 
 You lie and aspire to be as cunning 
 Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B sized D cup 
 Order the quarter deluxe, why don'tcha wake up 
 My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector 
 Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector 
 Went bezerk and worked, and exploded 
 She woke up in the morning and her face was coated 
 Buddy you study the man on the mic 
 D, do whatcha like 
 Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration 
 To peep that freak unique penetration 
 Well I figured out who makes the crack it's 
 The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets 
 Professor of science cuz I keep droppin' it 
 I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it 
 People always ask me what's the phenomenon 
 Yo what's up? Yo what's goin' on 
 No one really knows what I'm talkin' about 
 And yeah that's right my name's Yauch... 
 [DJ scratching] 
 Ponce De Leon, constantly on 
 The fountain of youth, not Robotron 
 Peace is a word I've heard before 
 So move and move and move up on the dance floor 
 Cuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day 
 Cuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way 
 Not like a roach or a piece of toast 
 I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach 
 Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas 
 [I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla] 
 Well, with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes 
 What I live I write and that's strictly rope 
 I got science for any occasion 
 Postulating theorems, formulating equations 
 Well, Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard 
 Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy 
 [Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange]Saklig...ahh, yeah 
  
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak (oh-oh) 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak (somethin' brand new for you) 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
  
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
  
 Puttin' songs together ain't no puzzle like Yahtzee 
 Sending this one out to K-Rob and Rammellzee 
 Well, let me introduce myself on this cut (woo) 
 I'm Adrock, I'm lit like a motherfuck 
  
 Well, I'm brewing up rhymes like I was using a still 
 Kickin' it old school flow like Mike McGill 
 Cause Yauch's on the upright, the shit just ain't funny 
 Got fat bass lines like Russell Simmons steals money 
  
 Got clientele, you know I rock well 
 And then you're on my dick because I'm DFL 
 Yeah, Mike, cause playing the bass is my favorite shit 
 I might be a hack on the stand up but I'm working at it 
  
 I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason 
 Then I ride the IRT right up to Penn Station (yeah) 
 Penn Station, up on 8th Ave 
 Listen all y'all, you get the ball back 
 He's got the Savior Faire because he's debonair 
 Well, Mike D with the vinyl, with the grooves so rare 
 And the rhymes that we're kickin' are doo-doo 
  
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
  
 Shit, if this is gonna be that kind of party 
 I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes 
  
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
  
 Been makin' with the freak freak, so unique 
 Been learning from the elders, now it's time to speak 
 Oh, that shit sounds nice 
 Mike D, come on and get it on, y'all 
  
 Talking shit about a mile a minute 
 Put the wax on the table and let the DJ spin it 
 Well, excuse me, motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon? 
 I'm gonna see the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
  
 And like the Knicks, I got game like I worked at Hasbro 
 On the mic I bug, like I was Prince Jazzbo 
 Well, the rhymes are stupid to make you go coo-koo 
 You can't sleep cause you're little Cindy Lou Who 
  
 Down with the Hurra since the Raising Hell Tour 
 Just listen to his cuts, there's no reason to tell more 
 Cindy what? I didn't catch the last one 
 That shit sounded kinda nice, but bust a fast one 
  
 Well, I'm not known for my speed raps 
 So grab the microphone and cut out the claps 
 Ah, yeah, I like that, shit is kind of rough 
 I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up 
  
 A'ight 
  
 Well, I might seem out there, just a little deranged 
 I've got to cool off, catch me on the driving range 
 Well I'm the ladies' choice like I was JJ Evans 
 Legalize the weed and I'll say, Thank heavens! 
  
 I'm talking PGA Pro Tour 2 
 I'm Doctor Beepers on the tv, in my golfing shoes 
 Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot 
 Then you throw me off the green because I'm strictly hip-hop 
 I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off 
 I'll grab the golf clubs and I'm off, I'm Audi, so check me 
  
 I've got the timbos on my toes when I'm not on the green 
 I've got the custom made boots with the spikey things 
 I'm working on my driving cause I'm going pro 
 I've got the funky fly golf gear from head to toe 
 Yeah, the B-Boys makin' with the freak freak cause it's unique unique 
 Mario's calling Nonni's about the pesto pizza 
 And then he's on a mission and he's checking for peacha 
  
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 
 B-Boys makin' with the freak freakAhh, yeah 
 I looked out the window seen his bald head 
 Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg 
 Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair 
 Launched that shot and he was caught out there 
 Saw the convertible driving by 
 I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly 
 He went for his to find he didn't have one 
 Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun 
 The egg, a symbol of life 
 I go inside your house and bust out your wife 
 I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke 
 The trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk 
 Reached in his pocket, took all his cash 
 Left my man standing with the egg mustache 
 Suckers, they come a dime a dozen 
 "When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy" 
  
 Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man 
 Driving around, king of the town (yeah) 
 Always got my windows rolled down 
 Ready to throw 
 You know, I'm the Egg Man 
  
 Once upon a time 
 Egg Man… 
  
 Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg 
 He was playing the wall, then he broke his leg 
 Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot 
 Hit the Rastaman, he said, (Bloodclot!) 
 What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg 
 Riding the trains, in between cars 
 When I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours 
 Drive-by eggings, plaguing LA 
 "Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!" 
 Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray) 
 Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy 
 People laugh, it's no joke 
 My name's "Yauch" and I'm throwing the yolk 
 "Now they got me in a cell," but I don't care 
 It was then that I got caught catching people out there 
  
 Up on the roof, in my car, up all night 
 I'm going through science like Dolemite 
 The Mack… Who? 
 I'm the Egg Man… Taxi driver? 
 I'm the Egg Man 
 Egg Man, Egg Man 
  
 We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back 
 We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back 
 Sam I Am, down with the program 
 Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam 
 Come Halloween, you know I come strapped 
 I throw it at a sucker… "k-pap" 
 You made the mistake and judge a man by his race 
 You go through life with egg on your face 
 Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling 
 Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling 
 The family, punk rocks, the businessman 
 I'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand 
 It's not like the crack that you put in a pipe 
 But crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe 
  
 Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man 
 Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man 
 Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man... 
 Egg Man...[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys] 
  
 Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about 
 I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out 
 No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder 
 Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder 
 Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas 
 And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees 
 We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest 
 And I shot those suckers and I'll shoot the rest 
  
 Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling 
 Cause I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
  
 Snatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight 
 I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate 
 We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties 
 Housing all girlies from city to city 
 One for all and all for one 
 Taking out emcees with a big shotgun 
 All for one and one for all 
 Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL 
 Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat 
 Big biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat 
 We got maidens and wenches - man, they're on the ace 
 Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face 
  
 Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
  
 Ali Baba and the forty thieves

 Ali Baba and the forty thieves 
 Ali Baba and the forty thieves 
 Ali Baba and the forty thieves 
 Ali Baba and the forty thieves 
  
 Torching and crakin' and rhymin' and stealin' 
 Robbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling 
 I'm wheelin', I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking 
 Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking 
 Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey 
 And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky 
 Skirt chasin', free basin' - killin' every village 
 We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage 
  
 Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
  
 I was… 
 I've been drinking my rum - a def son of a gun 
 *I fought the law* and I cold won 
 Blackbeard's weak - Moby Dick's on the chicks 
 Cause I pull out my jammy and squeeze off six 
 My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker 
 Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker 
 Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state 
 And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate 
  
 Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling 
 And I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
 Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
  
 Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling 
 'Cause I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
 Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
  
 Most chillinest b-boy 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
 Most killingest b-boy 
 I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin' 
 Most dustin' out b-boy

 Most finkiest b-boy 
 I'm doin' that finkin' 
 Most rhyminest b-boy

 Most shootinest b-boy

 Most rhyminest b-boy 
 I'll steal your shit, homeboy 
 Most taxinest b-boy

 Most illingest, illingest, illingest, b-boy 
 Waxin' all y'all squares 
 YeahHold it now, hit it 
 Yo, Leroy! 
 Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Why don't you hook up that def jam right about now? 
  
 Now I chill real ill when I start to chill 
 When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills 
 Sipping pints of ale out the window sill 
 When I get my fill I'm chilly-chill 
 Now, I just got home because I'm out on bail 
 What's the time, it's time to buy ale 
 Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time 
 If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine 
 Miller drinking, chicken eating, dress so fly 
 I got friends in high places that are keeping me high 
 Get down with Mike D and it ain't no hassle 
 I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle 
  
 Hold it now, hit it 
 Yo, Leroy! 
 It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme 
  
 And now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be 
 All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D 
 I'm down with Mike D and it ain't no baloney 
 For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni 
 I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day 
 Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock and he's MCA 
 Well, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing 
 I'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using 
 Around the way is where I'm from 
 And I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum 
 Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that juice 
 My name's Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis 
  
 Hold it now, hit it 
 Yo, Leroy! 
 Yo, that was real def man, try that again, man 
 I like that def stuff, boy 
  
 Hip-hoppin' and body rockin', doin' the do 
 Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue 
 Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps 
 My name's Mike D and I write my own snaps 
 I'm a peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce 
 I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose 
 Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum 
 I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from 
 Cheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk 
 Every day I drink O.E. and I don't go to work 
 You drippy nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears 
 You like men and we like beer 
  
 Hold it now, hit it 
 Yo, Leroy! 
 Bust that choco-lotto 
 What, huh, yo, man, pass that over here, man, alright 
  
 King of the Ave with the Def female 
 You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale 
 Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV 
 Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. E-D 
 Pump it up homeboy, just don't stop 
 Chef Boyardee, cooling on the pot 
 I take no slack, 'cause I got the knack 
 I'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack 
 The King Ad-Rock — that is my name 
 Y'all drinking Moet and we got the champagne 
 A quarter droppin', going shoppin', buyin' wigs 
 Surgeon general, cut professor, DJ Thigs 
  
 Hold it now, hit it 
 Hit it 
 Hold it now, hit it 
 Yo, Leroy!Hey 
 Hey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya 
 There never was a city kid truer and bluer 
 There's more to me than you'll ever know 
 And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh 
 Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery 
 Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery 
 Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon 
 And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion 
 I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib 
 I took off her moccasins and put on the bib 
 Wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of a stealin' 
 I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin' 
 Your body's on time and your mind is appealin' 
 Starin' at the cracks up there upon the ceilin' 
 Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin' 
 I'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing 
 Well, she's talking to the kid (who? to the kid) 
 I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did 
  
 Hey ladies, get funky 
 All the ladies in the house 
 The ladies, the ladies 
  
 Well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter 
 I dropped my drawers and said "Welcome back Kotter" 
 We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet 
 In my apartment, I begged her please stop it 
 The gift of gab is the gift that I have 
 And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab 
 Educated… No, Stupid… Yep 
 And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh 
 I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge 
 I'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large 
 With the white sassoons and the looks that kill 
 Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville 
 I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie 
 I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty 
 Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around 
 You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound 
 Step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme 
 I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside 
 Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live 
 Ladies flock like bees to a hive 
  
 Hey ladies, get funky 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies 
 Girls, girls 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies 
 One more time ain't it funky now 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies 
 Ain't it funky now 
  
 You know that 
 She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore 
 She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door 
 Break up with your girl, it ended in tears 
 Vincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear 
 I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin' 
 The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin' 
 She said come on over, it was me that she missed 
 I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed 
 Your old lady left you and you went insane 
 You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train 
 Well, take my advice at any price 
 A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man 
 Suckin' down pints 'till I didn't know 
 Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho 
 Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce 
 With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce 
 Girls with curls, and big long locks 
 And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks 
 Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one 
 She thinks she's the passionate one 
  
 Hey ladies, get funky 
 What's that? 
 Good god 
 Good god, dance 
 Good god 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Ain't it funky, brother? 
 He, ha, ha, ha 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies 
 Hey, hey, ladiesRiddle me this, my brother -- can you handle it? 
 Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it 
 Equinox symmetry and the and the balance is right 
 Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night 
 It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it 
 I cheat and steal and sin, and I'm a cynic 
 For those about to rock, we salute you 
 The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 The music washes over and you're one with the sound 
 Who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall 
 I think I'm starting to peak now, Al 
 And the man upstairs, I hope that he cares 
 If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire 
 We're just three emcees and we're on the go 
 SHADRACH, MESACH, ABEDNEGO 
  
 Only 24 hours in a day, only 12 notes a man can play 
 Music for all, not just one people 
 And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel 
 More Adidas sneakers than a plumber's got pliers 
 Got more suits than Jacoby & Meyers 
 If not for my vices, my bugged-out desires 
 My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires 
 So I'm out picking pockets at the Atlantic Antic 
 And nobody wants to hear you because your rhymes are so frantic 
 I mix business with pleasure way too much 
 You know -- wine and women and song and such 
 I don't get blue -- I got a mean red streak 
 You don't pay the band, your friends, yo that's weak 
 Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo 
 SHADRACH, MESACH, ABEDNEGO 
  
 Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks 
 Give to the poor and I always give thanks 
 Because I've got more stories than J.D.'s got Salinger 
 I hold the title and you are the challenger 
 I've got money like Charles Dickens 
 Got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chickens 
 And I'm always going out dapper like Harry S. Truman 
 I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman 
 (Never gonna let them say that I don't love you) 
 My noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts 
 And Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course 
 Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion 
 Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians 
 Like Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell 
 You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well 
 Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born 
 And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn 
 Sippin' on wine and mackin' 
 Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin' 
 Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me 
 (Being very proud to be an m.c.) 
 And the man upstairs, I hope that he cares 
 If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire 
 Amps and crossovers under my rear hood 
 Because the bass is bumping from the back of my Fleetwood 
  
 They tell us what to do? Hell, no! 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
  
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego (no) 
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego[Intro] 
 Yeah, get up 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA] 
 Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser 
 Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor 
 Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this 
 The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this 
 Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego 
 Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo 
 Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino 
 Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino 
 I burn the competition like a flamethrower 
 My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older 
 I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin' 
 I got the ball and I see the lane and 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We got a party on the left, a party on the right 
 We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight 
 Make some noise if you're with me 
 You gotta make some noise if you're with me 
 Crazy, crazy, crazy 
  
 [Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA] 
 Armed insurrection, popular election 
 Get paid every year like tax collection 
 Hear my perfection, rotary connection 
 Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection 
 I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed 
 You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted 
 And sifted, I'm just riffing 
 And when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping 
 I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle 
 A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle 
 My ego is off and running and gone 
 Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We got a-- 
 We got a party on the left, a party on the right 
 We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight 
 Make some noise if you're with me 
 You gotta make some noise if you're with me 
 Crazy, crazy, crazy 
 The break is crazy 
 Crazy-crazy 
  
 [Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA] 
 Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision 
 I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching 
 Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf 
 And you can show it to your friends and say, "That's my old self" 
 Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada 
 Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!) 
 The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance 
 To make romance in my B-boy stance 
 Parlay romancing into financing 
 Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson 
 The roaches check in, but they never check out 
 I set the record straight, no doubt 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We got a-- 
 We got a party on the left, a party on the right 
 We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight 
 Make some noise if you're with me 
 You gotta make some noise if you're with me[Intro] 
 "Yo I don't hang out with those guys, man, I ain't got nothing to do with those dudes." 
 "Wait a minute, I saw your female with 'em, too. What's up with her? I've been hearin' that she been givin' that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys." 
 "Yo, shut the fuck up, Chico, man!" 
 "I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass." 
  
 "Professor, what's another word for 'pirate treasure'?" 
 "Well, I think it's 'booty'. Booty, booty, that's what it is." 
  
 [Adrock] 
 Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump 
 And then you want to know why 
 Because I'm motherfuckin' truckin' 
 I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate 
 Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait 
 Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta 
 My voice sounds sweet cause it has to 
 So light a match to my ass cause I'm blowin' up 
 I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up 
 But now I want y'all to move it 
 Put your point on the floor and just prove it 
 And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all 
 A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right 
 Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in 
 I got this feelin' that it's back again 
 So don't touch me, cause I'm electric 
 And if you touch me, you'll get shocked 
  
 [Mike D] 
 You got, you got, you got, you got, you got 
 You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo 
 You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo 
 I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it 
 The only thing that saved me, has always been music 
 We've got our own studio, the Son of the G 
 It's no question, life's been good to me 
 Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove 
 A good mixtape to put you in the right mood 
 This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant 
 Coming through with beats for which I've been searching 
 Like two sealed copies, of expansions 
 I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions 
 The logo I sport is the face of the monkey 
 Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see? 
 My chrome is shining, just like an icicle 
 I ride around town in my low-rider bicyle 
  
 [MCA] 
 So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak 
 Ain't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack 
 And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic 
 A dictionary definition of the word spastic 
 You should have never started something that you couldn't finish 
 Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach 
 I'm bad ass, move ya' fat ass, cause you're wack, son 
 Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson 
 Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on 
 I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on 
 I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof 
 Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth 
 With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause 
 Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours 
 But like a pencil to a paper, I got more to come 
 One after another, you can all get some 
 So you better take your time, and meditate on your rhyme 
 Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine 
 And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all 
 You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all 
 And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul 
 You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all[Produced by Beastie Boys & Dust Brothers] 
  
 [Mike D] 
 I stay up all night, I go to sleep watching Dragnet 
 Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet 
 I'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper 
 When the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper 
 On the mic I score, just like the Yankees 
 Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee 
 Excuse me young lady, I don't mean to trouble ya 
 But you're lookin' so fly inside your BMW 
 I got lucky, I brought home the kitten 
 Before I got busy, I slipped on the mitten 
 Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing 
 Proud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a Ring-Ding 
 Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll 
 Doo-wah diddy and bust in with the pre-roll 
 Customs jailed me over an herb seed 
 Don't rat on your boy over some rat weed 
 I'm outta your back door, I'm into another 
 Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother 
 Not perfect grammar, always perfect timing 
 The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds 
  
 [MCA] 
 Roses are red, the sky is blue 
 I got my barrel at your neck, so what the fuck you gonna do 
 It's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes 
 The engine is the music and my nine's by my side 
 Cause you know Y-A-U-C-H 
 I'm taking all emcees out in the place 
 Takin' life as it comes, no fool am I 
 I'm goin' off, gettin' paid, and I don't ask why 
 Playin' beats on my box, makin' music for the many 
 Know a lot of def girls that’ll do anything 
 A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain 
 I'm just chillin', like Bob Dylan 
 Yeah, I smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain 
 I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane 
 People come up to me and they try to talk shit 
 Man, I was making records when you were suckin' your mother's dick 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Girl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes 
 You got fancy things, they're going up your nose 
 You're getting fancy gifts from expensive men 
 You're a dog on a leash, like a pig in a pen 
 Mothership connection, getting girls' affection 
 If your life needs correction, don't follow my direction 
 You got your 8 by 10, your agent, your Harley 
 You be driving around Hollywood with yo, 'Sorry, Charlie' 
 Cause I'm running things like some mack motherfucker 
 You slipin', you slackin', cause you're a false fake sucker 
 You slip, you slack; you clock me, and you lack 
 While I'm reading "On The Road" by my man, Jack Kerouac 
 Poetry in motion, coconut lotion 
 Had to diss the girl because she got too emotional 
 Are you experienced, little girl? 
 I want to know what goes on in your little girl world 
 Cause I'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me 
 I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me 
 So peace out, y'all, a PCP, song out 
 Full throttle to the bottle and full, full clout 
 And I'm outCause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter 
 The high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter 
 They can’t catch me, they’re never going to find me 
 They're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter 
  
 Pulled over to the river, to take a rest 
 Pulled out a pair of pliers pulled a bullet out of my chest 
 Fear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track 
 I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack 
 I'm long-distance from my girl and I'm talking on my cellular 
 She said that she was sorry and I said 'yeah the hell you were' 
 Check the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display 
 Check the odometer and I was on my way 
  
 Cause I'm the high plains drifter the best that you can get 
 A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette 
 Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed 
 Don't step to me cause you could be getting mushed 
  
 I'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes 
 Radar detector to tell me where the cops is 
 Spend another night at the Motel 6 
 It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks 
 And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter 
 I'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter 
 Cash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job 
 Found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob 
 I left my car outside and the engine still revving 
 Takin' care of business at 7-eleven 
 And then I went inside to make my withdrawal 
 I saw what he had had but I had to take it all 
 Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price 
 So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice 
 Cause I'm mellow like Jell-O, cool like lemonade 
 I made my get a way and then I thought that I had it made 
 I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star 
 Looked in the rear view mirror seen the police car 
 Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap 
 I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap 
 Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry 
 Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry 
 I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night 
 I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right 
 The cop knocked on my window and said "Boy, where's the fire?" 
 You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire" 
 "Outta the car longhair!" Your goose is cooked 
 Read me my rights, fingerprinted and booked 
  
 Making like a DT, driving a grand fury 
 Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry 
 Every dog has his day mine will be in front of a jury 
 High plains drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry 
  
 Read me my rights as if I didn't know this 
 Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis 
 With his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3 day old beer 
 My man turned to me and said, "Why are you here?" 
 I said, I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing 
 I'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing 
 I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D 
 He said, "You behave or we'll throw away the key" 
 Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee 
 I took the Bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB 
 I had a good feeling easy come easy go 
 I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show 
 And sure enough, that nag came in 
 Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win 
 And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger 
 Hot-wired hot wheeled and, "Suzy is a headbanger"[Intro] 
 Goodness gracious! 
  
 [MCA] 
 If you can feel what I’m feeling then it's a musical masterpiece 
 If you can hear what I’m dealing with then that's cool at least 
 What's running through my mind comes through in my walk 
 True feelings are shown from the way that I talk 
 And this is me y'all, I emcee y'all 
 My name is MCA and I still do what I please 
 And now I’d like to introduce (what's up?) 
 I'll pass the mic to D for a fist full of truth 
  
 [Mike D] 
 The name is D, y'all and I don't play 
 And I can rock a block party 'til your hair turns grey 
 So, what you sayin'? I explode on site 
 I’m like Jimmy Walker I’m Dynomite 
 And now I’d like to pass the mic 
 To Adrock c'mon and do anything you like 
  
 [Adrock]

 In the place with the bass I’m going all the way 
 I can't stop, y'all, tock tick, y'all 
 And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick, y'all 
 ‘Cause I’mma turn it in and I’mma turn it out 
 But now I’ve got to pass the mic to Yauch 
  
 [MCA] 
 Well, on and on and on and on 
 I can't stop, y'all 'til the early morn’ 
 So rock rock , y'all, tick tock, y'all 
 To the beat, y'all, c'mon and rock, y'all 
  
 [Adrock, MCA, & Mike D] 
 I give thanks for inspiration, it guides my mind along the way 
 A lot of people get jealous, they're talking about me 
 But that's just cause they haven't got a thing to say 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Well everybody's rapping like it's a commercial 
 Actin' like life is a big commercial 
 So this is what I’ve got to say to you all 
 Be true to yourself and you will never fall 
 And now I’d like to pass the mic to A 
 So what's your name, Yauch? 
  
 [MCA] 
 My name is MCA 
 I’ve been coming to where I am from the get go 
 Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go 
 So put your worries on hold 
 Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul 
 And now I’d like to pass the mic 
 To my brother Adrock c'mon and shine like a light 
  
 [Adrock] 
 Yes, yes, y'all and yes, yes, y'all 
 I’m always on time never the less, y'all 
 And that's right y'all, I shed light, y'all 
 I’ve got no time in my life to get uptight, y'all 
 So what you gonna’ say that I don't know already? 
 I’m like Clyde and I’m Rockin' Steady 
 But time flies when you're having fun 
 So Mike D? That's me. C'mon and get some 
  
 [Mike D] 
 M.I.K.E. to the D 
 You come and see me and you pay a fee 
 Do what I do professionally 
 To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be 
 Now Ad-Rock (huh?) and MCA (yeah?) 
 Let's rock this joint in the old school way 
  
 [Adrock, MCA, & Mike D] 
 Well I’m on 'til the crack of dawn 
 Mowing down emcees like I’m mowing a lawn 
 I go off like nothing can phase me 
 You think we'll ever meet Stevie? one of these days, D 
 But I can stand my ground and I am down 
 To wax an emcee who acts like a clown 
 But for now, I’d like to ask you how 
 You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowdYes, yes, y'all, (y'all) and you don't stop (stop) 
 Keep it on (on) and shockin' the place (yo, Yauch) 
 Well, I'm MCA, I got nothin' to prove 
 Pay attention, my intention is to bust a move (what?) 
 I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes (what up?) 
 Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes 
  
 Well, I'm Mike D, I got the deuces wild (yeah boy) 
 A list of girlies numbers that I've dialed 
 I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis 
 I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Brutus 
  
 Well, I'm schoolin' in the boys' room, coolin' by the locker (well) 
 All the girls in class knows that I'm the cool rocker (uh, yeah) 
 Punk in the hall, man, I should of, ought to hit him 
 Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bit 'em 
  
 Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best 
 While you were at a party, your girlfriend fessed (Check it) 
 I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious 
 Fly around the world, but it makes me nauseous 
 Mike D.'s day off everyday of the week (ah, D, keep it on) 
 I got to the party - and I did the freak 
  
 I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda 
 You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda 
 I'm a Def Manhattan killer - a rhyme thriller 
 A mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of Miller 
  
 I got a hat, not a visor - I drink Budweiser 
 The turntables, up on the drum riser 
 The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter 
 I know that I'm fly; man, there's no need to flatter 
 I travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy 
 My name's Mike D. - now watch me get busy, y'all 
  
 G-g-get busy y'all 
 G-g-get busy y'all 
  
 You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted 
 Dusted, rusted, mustard, 'sgusted 
 Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard 
 Mustard, mustard, mustard, mustard 
 You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted 
 Busted, busted, busted, busted 
 Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted 
 'sgusted, 'sgusted,  'sgusted 
  
 I'm from downtown the city from of Manhattan 
 I got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin' 
 My posse's in effect and we're doin' the do 
 And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew 
 Caught you poppin' that weak and you must have been dusted 
 Dusted, dusted, dusted, dusted 
 Stuck your head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it 
 Flushed it, flushed it, flushed it, flushed it 
 WordThat's a record 
  
 Uhhhh... 
 Huh 
  
 Yeah, I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 So how we gonna’ kick it? 
 Gonna’ kick it root down 
 Yeah, how you wanna’ kick it? 
 Gonna’ kick it root down 
 So how you gonna’ kick it? 
 Gonna’ kick it root down 
 Gonna’ break it on down, gonna’ kick it root down 
  
 It's not a put down 
 I put my foot down 
 And then I make some love, I put my root down 
 I’m like sweetie pie by the stone alliance 
 Everbody knows I'm known for dropping science 
 ‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman 
 I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin' 
 Never let you down with the stereo sound 
 So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out 
  
 We're talking root down, I put my boot down (boot down) 
 And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (loot down) 
 I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (scoot down) 
 I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (goose down) 
 Come up representing from the upper west 
 Money Making putting me to the test 
 Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed 
 Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it) 
  
 Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys 
 Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py" 
 Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born 
 But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee) 
 You might think that I'm a fanatic 
 A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic 
 So break it to the root when we kick it on down 
 Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound 
  
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 So how you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Cause how we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So how we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down (yeah) 
  
 Well, Adrock (huh) 
 Don't stop, come on 
 Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc 
  
 I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like brim 
 I'm walking down your block and you say that's him 
 There goes the guy with the funky sound 
 The Beatsie Boys, you know we come to get down 
 Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick 
 And say “Oh my god, that's the funky shit! 
 So I’m-a pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah) 
 The original nasal kid is doing damage 
  
 Every morning I took the train to High Street Station 
 Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation 
 On the way back up, hearing battle tapes 
 Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes 
 Like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show 
 It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee 
 There's one you should know, (yeah) 
 Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due 
 MCA, grab the mic and ma bell will connect you 
  
 Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight 
 "If dancin' prays to the lord then I will feel alright" 
 It feels good to play a little music (music) 
 Tears running down my face ‘cause I love to do it (love to do it) 
 And no one can stop this flow from flowing on 
 A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah) 
 I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah) 
 For bringing me into this world and so on 
  
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 So how we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Yeah, how you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So how we gonna rock it? 
 Gonna rock it root down 
 Break it on down, gonna kick it root down 
  
 Yeah, that shit's on down 
  
 And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario 
 And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario 
 And that's a record, that's a record to Mario 
  
 Awww, now that's a record, buddy[Intro] 
 "Ready? One... You will do this four times with the left 
 Four with the right, then eight times with both 
 Then repeat" Ah... Clap your hands... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now, let me get some action from the back section 
 We need body rockin' not perfection 
 Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc 
 And let your spine unwind — just take a risk 
 I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn 
 Tell me party people, is that so wrong? 
 The ship is docking, interlockin' 
 And up-rockin', electro-shocking 
 We're getting down, computer action 
 Do the robotic satisfaction 
 Now all of y'all, get off the wall 
 Have a ball and get involved with 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Flame on, I'm gone 
 I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon 
 Came out rapping when I was born 
 Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn 
 Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion 
 Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion 
 The sound of the music makin' you insane 
 You can't explain to people this type of mind frame 
 Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape 
 I'm fine like wine when I start to rap 
 We need body-rockin', not perfection 
 Let me get some action from the back section 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Mike D, with the master plan 
 I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am 
 And when I grab the mic, you scream, "Ooh, goddamn" 
 The crème de la crème is who I am 
 MCA, where have you been? 
 Packed like sardines in the tin 
 So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins 
 'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim 
 And Adrock, light up the place 
 And if you pull my card, you pull the ace 
 And if you ask me, turn up the bass 
 And if you play defender 
 I could be your hyperspace... So 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Outro] 
 "You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right 
 Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each 
 Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet 
 Left foot... Ready? It's one two three four five"Well, this girl came up to me - she says she's new in town 
 But the crew been said they seen her around 
 I thought they were right but I didn't want to know 
 The girlie was def and she wanted to go 
 I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose 
 I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce 
 The next thing she said, "My place or yours? 
 Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!" 
 We got into the cab - the cab driver said 
 He recognized my girlie from the back of her head 
 He said a little something about tip to base 
 So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place 
 I shouldn't have looked back, man, I'll always regret it 
 Something's going on and I'll probably never get it 
 She was crying like a baby - stupid dumb 
 It's just too bad that girl's a bum 
  
 (chorus) She's crafty - she gets around 
 She's crafty - she's always down 
 She's crafty - she's got a gripe 
 She's crafty - and she's just my type 
 She's crafty 
  
 I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett 
 When I seen this girl I could never forget 
 Now, I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile 
 And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while 
 The girl came up to me, she said she loved the show 
 Asked her to come home and she couldn't say no 
 We got to the crib - there's Adam and D 
 We didn't say a word - they just stared at me 
 I said, "I don't know her - I just met her tonight." 
 And Adrock started hiding everything in sight 
 D pulled me over - said hide your gold 
 The girl is crafty like ice is cold 
 The girl is crafty - she knows all the moves 
 I started playing records - she knew all the grooves 
 He thought she was a thief - and D was right 
 But I just figured she'd spend the night 
 When I woke up late in the afternoon 
 She had taken all the things from inside his room 
 I found myself naked in the middle of the floor 
 She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers 
 The mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord 
 My remote control and my old skateboard 
 She robbed us blind - she took all we owned 
 And the boys blamed me for bringing her home 
  
 She's crafty, she gets around 
 She's crafty, she's always down 
 She's crafty, she's got a gripe 
 She's crafty and she's just my type 
 She's crafty 
  
 Uh, yeah 
  
 (repeat chorus x2)[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys] 
  
 They got a committee to get me off the block 
 Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop 
 Because being bad news is what we're all about 
 We went to White Castle and we got thrown out 
  
 I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock 
 I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock 
 I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud 
 So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud 
  
 Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go 
 I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow 
 I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back 
 My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack 
  
 She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler 
 Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler 
 With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand 
 Ay, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man? 
  
 I got money - I got juice 
 I got to the party and I got loose 
 I got rhythms - I got rhymes 
 I got the girlies with the def behinds 
 I got ill - I got busted 
 I got dust and I got dusted 
 I got gold - I got funky 
 I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey 
  
 Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell 
 I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell 
 Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube 
 Eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew 
 I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave 
 I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have 
 All the fine ladies are making a fuss 
 But I can't pay attention - cause I'm on that dustSome static started... In the pool hall 
 Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball 
 And I met this girl, she tried to gank me 
 So I smacked her in the booty with a plank, B 
 Cause me and my crew are out breaking windows 
 The Bingo, the lotto, you know I'll never win those 
 Possession is half the law 
 I had my routines before all y'all 
 Your whole life is coming apart at the seams 
 You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines 
 See I'm a city slicker 
 I, I ain't no townie 
 Right now, I wish I had another hash brownie 
 And like Ricky always said, you've got to toke and pass 
 Or Mookie's gonna' kick your motherfucking ass 
 Try to take what isn't yours like a Goddamn rat 
 See I, personally, I wouldn't even wanna' go out like that 
  
 I'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it 
 I don't buy cheeba, I grow it 
 ("I'm a farmer") 
 People always trying to get next to me 
 I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy 
 I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer 
 Because I had to deal with a money-hungry miser 
 Had a caine filled Kool with my man, Rush Rush 
 Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush 
 You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror 
 My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her 
 You can't deny me, you always want to try me 
 Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked 
 Homeboy, throw in the towel 
 Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell 
 The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast 
 Smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast 
  
 All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters 
 Sitting in the White House pulling their peters 
 Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street 
 The only cop with a rope chain when he's walking the beat 
 So like a sneaky pouch time-bomb ticking 
 A-like the beat to my rhyme just kicking 
 Space cake cookies 
 I discover who I am 
 I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man 
 Five-oh caught me now I'm going to the mountains 
 Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyer and accountants 
 My mind is kinda rhyming and I think I oughta think 
 So I'm rockin all the rhymes, and I'll have another drink 
 So the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning 
 I feel like it is always the beginning 
 Of another rhyme 
 I'm rapping, emceeing, I rock 
 You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stoppedI'm rolling down the hill, snowballing, getting bigger 
 An explosion in the chamber, the hammer from the trigger 
 I seen him get stabbed, I watched the blood spill out 
 He had more cuts than my man, Chuck Chillout 
 24 is my age and 22 is my gauge 
 I'm writing rhymes on a page, I'm goin' off in a rage 
 Cause I'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission 
 Had a small problem with the transmission 
 Three on the tree in the middle of the night 
 I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight 
 Life comes in phases, take the good with the bad 
 You bought the coins on the street (Holmes), and you know you got had 
 Because it's all high spirit, you know you got to hear it 
 Don't touch the mic, baby, don't come near it 
  
 It's gonna get you, it's gonna get you 
 It's gonna get you, girl, it's gonna get you 
  
 Looking down the barrel of a gun 
 Son of a gun, son of a bitch 
 Getting paid, getting rich 
  
 Ultra violence be running through my head 
 Cold medina, y'all, makin' me see red 
 Rapid fire Louie, like Rambo got bullets 
 I'm a die harder, like my kid Bruce Willis 
 I love girlies, waxing and milking 
 Coordinating trim is my man, Dave Scilken 
 Predetermined destiny is who I am 
 You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am 
 Like Clockwork Orange, going off on the town 
 I've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down 
 Well, I'm mad at my desk, and I'll be writing all curse words 
 Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words 
 You're a headless chicken chasin', a sucker freebasin 
 You're looking for a fist to put your face in 
 Well, get hip, get hip, don't slip ya knuckle heads 
 Racism is schism, on a serious tip[Intro - Nas] 
 Mic check, mic check 
  
 [Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys) 
 One (one), two (two), three (three) 
 Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs 
 It goes three (three), two (two), one (one) 
 MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done 
 Like ladies and gents, attention 
 Nas in the house with Beastie Boys 
 We can turn it out 
 Perpetrators, we can point 'em out 
 So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out 
  
 [MCA] 
 Yo, I been in the game since before you was born 
 I might still be MCing even after you're gone 
 Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow 
 The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so 
 On and on until the crack of dawn 
 Until the year 3000 and beyond 
 Stay up all night, and I MC and never die 
 Cause death is the cousin of sleep 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie 
 Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie 
 Oh my God, just look at me 
 Grandpa been rappin' since '83 
 I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad 
 Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag 
 Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad 
 All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs 
  
 [Nas] 
 I have carte blanche, the vagabond 
 Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund 
 I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a 
 You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer 
 A slug peeler, you're not 
 Mafioso, no 
 You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner 
 I ain't tryin' to hear your racket 
 You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat 
 You wear that jacket 
  
 [Mike D] 
 How many rappers must get dissed 
 Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this 
 I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss 
 The real hip hop with which I persist 
 Like rum in mojitos 
 Bullets and banditos 
 Matzoh balls in soup 
 Jackets and troop 
 Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books 
 Nasty Nas, what's the word? 
 Count it off on the hook 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [MCA] 
 Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain 
 To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame 
 My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister 
 So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer 
 Too many rappers to shake a stick at 
 I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to 
 Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records 
 My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 To all you crab rappers and hackers 
 And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda 
 I take the cake, I stole the mold 
 The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold 
 And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace? 
 Sniffin', buffin', huffin' 
 And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin 
 Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin' 
  
 [Nas] 
 I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway 
 Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day 
 I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay 
 And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this 
 By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers 
 I hear Russian blonde's the wettest 
 But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas 
 And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up? 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Mike D, the man of mystery 
 History in the makin', and now we're takin' 
 Titles, awards, and accolades 
 Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades 
 We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches 
 Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases 
 Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars 
 Go back in time, send a fax from my car 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 ("Hey, yo, Adam what's up? This is Mix Master Mike. I'm calling from Sacramento. Umm, I've been wanting to hook up with you maybe on some tracks. I've got some shit right here. If you could... 
 I set my turntable to a wah wah pedal 
 It's called the tweak scratch.") 
  
 Cause nobody can do it like Mix Master can 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Come on 
 I've got the D double-O D double-O style 
 Here we go again because it's been a while 
 Do me a favor, don't touch that dial 
 I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile 
  
 [Mike D] 
 My name's Mike D, and I'm the ladies choice 
 I wanna' get next to you like Rose Royce (Royce) 
 Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice 
 Cause when its time to rhyme, you know I get noice (voice) 
  
 [MCA] 
 Cruising like a fan boat on the glade 
 He'll tweak your ass across the cross fade 
 So watch your back when he takes the stage (stage) (woo!) 
 Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Three MC's and one DJ 
 We be getting down with no delay 
 Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say? 
 ("Bug out!" "To!" "The mic" "All the time!") 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Sweet and sour like a tangerine 
 Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes 
 Kenny Rogers' "Gambler" is my gambling theme 
 Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine 
  
 [MCA] 
 Always updated and in the know (know) 
 You know we break it down going toe to toe 
 The bass is booming from down below 
 Ed Norton is chillin with Mario (woo-wee!) 
  
 [Adrock] 
 Well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio 
 Don't ask me cause I just don't know 
 I'm known to mop, I'm known to glow (glow) 
 But don't get mad cause I gots to go 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Three MCs and one DJ 
 We be getting down with no delay 
 Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say? 
 ("Gotta, gotta," "Gotta get down!") 
  
 Mix Master, cut faster 
 Mix Master, cut-cut, cut faster! 
  
 [MCA] 
 All top secret and classified ('fied) 
 I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide 
 It's all hypnotic and sanctified (woo-wee!) 
 I never wanna let a bad day slip by 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Now we be getting stupid in your area (huh?) 
 Causing all kinds of hysteria ('steria) 
 My beats is sick like malaria 
 But don't worry, I'll take care of ya 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Me and Adam, Adam, and Mario C 
 In the studio with the place to be 
 To all the party people who are happy and free (free) 
 With Mix Master Mike, we're making history 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Three MC's and one DJ 
 We be getting down with no delay 
 Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say? 
 ("God damn, that DJ made my day") 
  
 [Outro] 
 ("You came off with that one, Joe 
 Oh, my goodness")What's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 And what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 So what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 Now what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
  
 I'm not the type of person who likes to waste my time 
 And when I'm on the mic - I just say my rhymes 
 Because I'm out on bail - the check is in the mail 
 They can sentence me to life - and I won't go to jail 
 I'm cool, calm, collected - from class I was ejected 
 Just me, Mike D., and M.C.A. - we're rarely disrespected 
 I got all the time that I need to kill 
 What's the time? - it's time to get ill 
  
 You been fully captivated by that funky-ass bass 
 Your girlfriend screams when MCA's in the place 
 He stumbles in the room with the Chivas in his hand 
 Cold chillin' on the spot at the microphone stand 
 I'd have the pedal to the metal if I had a car 
 But I'm chiller with the Miller - cold coolin' at the bar 
 I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still 
 What's the time? - it's time to get ill 
  
 Yeah 
 Look-lookin'-look-look-look-look-lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time 
 Lookin' at my gucci, it's about that time 
  
 Deee... 
 Went outside my house - I went down to the deli 
 I spent my last dime to refill my fat belly 
 I got rhymes galime - I got rhymes galilla 
 And I got more rhymes than Phyllis Diller 
 MCA takes a stand - man you're in command 
 Homebody, turn it out and don't give a damn 
 Man my name is MCA - I've got a license to kill 
 What's the time? - it's time to get ill 
  
 I'm Mr. Ed 
 The famous Mr. Ed 
 Riding down the block…uh-ahh... 
  
 Riding down the block with my box in my hand 
 Today I feel like chillin' just as chill as I can 
 Coolin' on the corner with a forty of OE 
 Cause me and MCA we're down with Mike D 
 Man when I run a jam - I don't give a damn 
 When I'm throwing bass - I say, "Thank you, ma'am." 
 Fuel injected, rhyme connected - running things 
 I'm the King Adrock and I'm the king of all kings 
 I'm looking for a spot - things are gettin' hot 
 I'm MCA, I'm here to stay - and you sir, are not 
 Oh no, it could not be - it's such a sight to see 
 It's such a trip - you're on my tip so listen to Mike D 
 My work is my play - cause I'm playing when I work 
 My name's Mike D, as you can see and I can do the jerk 
 MCA, Adrock, Mike D - it's chill 
 What's the time? - it's time to get ill 
  
 Now what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 And what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 So what's the time? 
 It's time to get ill 
 And what's the time? 
 It's time to get illOne, two, three, four 
 One, two, three, four 
 One, two, three, four 
  
 Oh, wine cooler 
  
 Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop 
 I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup 
 He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch 
 He's even more over than my mayor, Ed Koch 
 Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four 
 Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more 
 Livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money 
 Sleepin' on the street, there ain't a damn thing funny 
 With the hand-me-down food, and the hand-me-down clothes 
 A rockabilly past of which nobody knows 
 Makes his home all over the place 
 He goes to sleep by falling down on his face 
 Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless 
 Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless 
 Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box 
 He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks 
  
 Well... 
 Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall 
 Kickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown 
 Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall 
  
 He drinks where he lies, he's covered with flies 
 He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes 
 Well, go upstate and get your head together 
 Thunderbird is the word, and you're light as a feather 
 Detox at the flop house, no booze allowed 
 Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd 
 Memphis is where he's from (in Tennessee) 
 He lives in the street but he's no bum 
 A rockabilly star from the days of old 
 He used to have teeth all filled with gold 
 A platinum voice, but only gold records 
 On the bass was Boots on the drums was Checkers 
 Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar

 Who do you think you are 
  
 Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall 
 Drinkin' night train, drinkin' O.E

 One, two, three, four 
 One, two, three, four 
 One, two, three... 
  
 Donald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the men's Shelter 
 Wonderbread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter 
 He asks for a dollar, you know what it's for 
 Man, bottle after bottle, he always needs more 
 He's no less important than you working class stiffs 
 Drinks a lot of liquor, but he don't drink piss 
 He paid his dues playing the blues 
 He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes 
 Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army 
 That's right y'all his name is Johnny, kick it 
  
 Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall

 Check the cool wax!Listen, All You New Yorkers 
  
 Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten 
 From the Battery to the top of Manhattan 
 Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin 
 Black, White, New York you make it happen 
  
 Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers 
 Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders 
 We come together on the subway cars 
 Diversity unified, whoever you are 
 We're doing fine on the One and Nine line 
 On the L we're doin' swell 
 On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss 
 Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must 
 I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks 
 Running home after school to play PIXX 
 At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street 
 And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet 
 Dear New York, I hope you're doing well 
 I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell 
 So, we give thanks for providing a home 
 Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves 
  
 Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten 
 From the Battery to the top of Manhattan 
 Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin 
 Black, White, New York you make it happen 
  
 The L.I.E., the BQE 
 Hippies at the band shell with the LSD 
 Get my BVD's from VIM 
 You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can 
 Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out 
 Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out 
 You didn't rob me in the park at Diana Ross 
 But everybody started looting when the light went off 
 From the South South Bronx, on out to Queensbridge 
 From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge 
 From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side 
 From 1010 WINS to Live At Five 
 Dear New York, this is a love letter 
 To you and how you brought us together 
 We can't say enough about all you do 
 Cause in the city we're ourselves and electric, too 
  
 Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten 
 From the Battery to the top of Manhattan 
 Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin 
 Black, White, New York you make it happen 
  
 Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from 
 Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem 
 To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met 
 Before they moved on down to the Upper West 
 I see you're still strong after all that's gone on 
 Life long we dedicate this song 
 Just a little something to show some respect 
 To the city that blends and mends and tests 
 Since 9/11, we're still livin' 
 And lovin’, life we've been given 
 Ain't nothing gonna' take that away from us 
 Were lookin' pretty and gritty cause in the city we trust 
 Dear New York, I know a lot has changed 
 2 towers down, but you're still in the game 
 Home to the many, rejecting no one 
 Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from 
  
 Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten 
 From the Battery to the top of Manhattan 
 Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin 
 Black, White, New York you make it happenHello Brooklyn! 
  
 New York, New York - it's a hell of a town 
 You know The Bronx is up, and I'm Brooklyn down 
 Because they don't know my name - only know my initials 
 Building bombs in the attic for elected officials 
 I quit my job, I cut my hair 
 You know, I cut my boss because I don't care 
 You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle 
 You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle 
 Cause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of 
 You'll be stickin up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off 
 I'm a buffalo soldier, broader than Broadway 
 Keep keepin' on, I don't care what they say 
 I play my stereo loud, I disturb my neighbors 
 I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor 
  
 Cause I am the holder of the three-pack bonanza 
 If you open the book, then you will get your hand slapped 
 I am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza 
 If you ask a question, then you will get the answer 
  
 Her breast, I saw, I reached, I felt 
 M, O-N, E-Y, the belt 
 I stay at home, just, like a hermit 
 I got the jammy but I don't got the permit (you know why) 
 You got a boyfriend, and his name is Nick 
 Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick 
 I ride around town cause my ride is fly 
 I shot a man in Brooklyn ("just to watch him die")[Intro] 
 Yo...yo...yo...he-hello...he-hello...yo...hello 
 He-hello...he-hello...yo...hello 
 He-hello...he-hello...yo... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Time, time, time, time 
 It's times like this when I just can't stop 
 Can't wind your body without the body rock 
 Got schemes, schematics, blue prints on file 
 You got to have dreams to make it all worthwhile 
 So as I take my time and realign 
 I wonder what it is I hope to find 
 I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast 
 But I'm intercontinental when I eat French toast 
 Adrock--woo!--with the New Edition 
 Gettin' on down for the year 2000 
 A slight distraction can get you paid 
 And when it comes to that type shit, I paved the way 
  
 [Hook] 
 BBoys to the early morn 
 BGirls be rockin' on and on 
 BGirls to the break of dawn 
 BBoys be rockin' on and on 
  
 Hey...hey 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable 
 I bet you never knew, I got the ill peripheral 
 In your home, I'm cloned, I'm on your headphones 
 I love it when you spazz out all alone 
 Cause I'm that fool that broke the key 
 I'm unlockable so don't check me 
 I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind 
 The sky is falling and I'm fallin' behind 
 So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain 
 Insane mind games move quick like flames 
 So now I wonder how sometimes you never know 
 Who be rockin y'all in stere-ereo 
 In stere-ereo, in stere-ereo, in stereo 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 A no time like the present to work shit out 
 That's what we're going on and on and on about 
 I'm not fakin', just makin' beats in the Dungeon 
 Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent 
 No shame in my game just par for the path 
 I try to hone my craft because at hand's the task 
 But I find I'm not playing with a full deck 
 I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec 
 All I want to know is when is checkout time 
 So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme 
 And when I'm with my man, Shadi Rock, at the gates 
 We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks 
  
 [Hook] 
 BBoys to the early morn 
 BGirls be rockin' on and on 
 BGirls to the break of dawn 
 BBoys be rockin' on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on...

 He likes it so much, he sucks a sow

 It's never old school - all brand new 
 So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu 
 Not like a fever - not like a cold 
 The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold 
 So don't see a doctor or see a nurse 
 Just listen to the music - first things first 
 First of all - get off the wall 
 It's time to party so have a ball 
 We slowed it on down - so get the hell up 
 Like a volcano, I'll erupt 
 We got determination - bass and highs 
 White Castle fries only come in one size 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen - nothing yet 
  
  
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
  
 I do not sing - but I make a Def song 
 You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long 
 On the Gong Show, we won't get gonged 
 We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong 
 Strong as a ox - fresh out the box 
 The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks 
 And when we go on - the crowd goes off 
 It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft

 We don't only rock the house but the house we rock 
 We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top 
 MCA, Adrock, Mike D makes three 
 And we can do it like this in the place to be 
 When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded 
 I know my song is Def cause you all applauded 
 Not PCP or LSD - just me, Mike D, in the place to be 
 This is not free - you must pay a fee 
 Cash on delivery like a COD 
  
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
  
 The beat is slow in order to dance 
 I wanna hear "I do"s and no "I can't" 
 First you move your legs - and then your arms 
 It's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm 
 It's truly stable and you ought to be able 
 To dance to the record when it's on the turntable 
  
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo 
  
 Let it flow - let yourself go 
 Slow and low - that is the tempo

 He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost

 He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost 
  
 Well, if your world was all black, and then your world was all white 
 Well then you wouldn't get much color out of life now, right? 
 I'm nicknamed Shamrock, well, my name is not Shamus 
 Girlies on the tippy cause my homey is famous 
 My name is not O'Houlihee, nor is it Brian 
 If I said that I was weak, man, you know I'd be lyin 
 Well, suckers try to bite, yeah, then try to pursue it 
  
 Ya explain to a musician… 
 Them knew it, but them can't do itYeah... 
 To all the Brooklyn girls 
 To all the French girls 
 To all of the Oriental girls

 And the Italian women 
 To the Upper East Side nubiles 
 To all the Jamaican girls 
 And to the topless dancers 
 Australian 
 And Brazilian 
 To the Southern belles 
 To the Puerto Rican girls 
 To the stewardesses flying around the worldEmcee for what I am, and do 
 The A is for Adam, and the lyrics... true 
 So as pray and hope, that the message is sent 
 And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt 
 Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three 
 Me and Adam and D were born, to emcee 
 And my body and soul and mind are pure 
 Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure 
 Just lyrics from I to you, recited 
 Arrested, bailed, but cuffed and indicted 
 Enter the arena as I take the center stage 
 The lights set low, and the night has come of age 
 Take the microphone in hand as I am a professional 
 Speak my knowledge to the crowd, and the Ed is Special 
 For I am the Bard and I am the last one 
 I am the king, and this is my castle 
 Dwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past 
 Seen a glimpse from ahead, and I don't think it's gonna last 
 And you can bet your ass 
  
 I drop the L when I'm skiin' 
 I'm smokin and peakin 
 I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend 
 Can't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin along 
 Can't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong 
 Broke my bindings, the lion with wings 
 Preaching his words in the b-boy sing 
 I am one with myself, as I turn to thee 
 Prefer the dreams to the reality 
 I prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife 
 Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife 
 But it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day 
 Or for a week, or for a year, or for a year in a day 
 Come what may... 
  
 I'm fishin' in my boat and I'm fishing for trout 
 Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout 
 Fishing for a line inside my brain 
 And looking out at the world through my window pane 
 Every day has many colors cause the glass is stained 
 Everything has changed but remains the same 
 So once again the mirror raised, and I see myself as clear as day 
 And I'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny 
 Feeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me 
 He who sees the end from the beginning of time 
 Looking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be 
 Check the prophetic sections of the pages 
  
 EZ Mike with the Disco Dave 
  
 He goes by the name of the D-D-D-Disco Dave 
 Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave 
 Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave 
 Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave 
 Disco DaveOverripe, fresh-skeezed, California females 
 With 3-inch, cherry red, press-on Lee nails 
 Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking 
 Like a garbage bag full, overflowing (please) now it's leaking 
 Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair 
 So I can climb up and get into your underwear 
 Rat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk 
 You're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk 
 You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head 
 You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head 
 You're all mixed up, like pasta primavera 
 Yo, why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man? 
 Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor 
 So get that money out of your ass, you whore 
 Well, I brought her upstairs onto the roof 
 I dogged your wife, and she is a doofus 
  
 So what goes around comes around 
 And what goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 And what comes around goes around (goes around) 
 Chosen bound 
 Fully down 
 Feeling down 
 Yo, Holmes, your nose is brown 
  
 Clean B, cleaning the G spot, you know that we've got 
 The Dolemite's house and you have not 
 Look out my window, look over the city 
 With two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty 
 Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat 
 Why you wanna treat your girl like that? 
 Living in the rat race, smoking rat weed 
 Well, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed 
 Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto 
 Got more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto 
  
 What goes around comes around 
 And what goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 And what comes around goes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 And what goes around inevitability 
 Comes around, what? 
 And what goes around comes around 
 What goes around, you know, it comes around 
 What? 
 Check it, check it 
 Check it, what, what, what, what

 And I gotta say we are having a ball up here tonight 
 And when you're ready and...} 
  
 Shabba doo, shabba dee 
 Shabba dee, shabba doo 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad-Rock] 
 Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book? 
 Look, give it back, you're wicky-wack 
 With your ticky-tack calls…  Didn't touch you at all 
 I didn't touch your hand — man, you know it’s all ball 
  
 [Verse 2: MCA] 
 You sold a few records but don't get slick 
 Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits 
 You've been in the game, your career is long 
 But when you break it down you've only got 2 songs 
  
 [Verse 3: Mike D] 
 MC's are like clay pigeons when I'm shootin' skeet 
 I just yell pull and Mike drops the beat 
 You people call yourselves MC's but you're garbage men 
 Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen 
  
 [Hook-Line:] 
 And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you! 
  
 [Verse 4: Ad-Rock] 
 I read about you up on page 6 
 They was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed 
 Now talk about your face now don't get pissed 
 But I suggest you see a dermatologist 
  
 [Verse 5: MCA] 
 I keep that hot sauce hot - not mild and weak 
 It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak 
 I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex 
 Cause I've got more rhymes than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks 
  
 [Verse 6: Mike D] 
 Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch 
 You're hearing me and you're like, "Oh my god its Sasquatch!" 
 I'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit 
 So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit 
  
 [Hook-Line:] 
 And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you! 
  
 [Sample:] 
 So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself 
  
 [Hook:] 
 And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you! 
  
 [Verse 7: Ad-Rock] 
 Sucker MC’s, it's me they're resenting 
 In the animal kingdom, they call it presenting 
 With the dipsy-doodle, the kit and caboodle 
  
 [Verse 8: MCA] 
 The truth is brutal, your grandma's kugel 
 Kings County is my stomping ground 
 The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown 
 So don't ask me to wine and dine ya 
 I'm from Brooklyn, you're from Regina 
  
 [Verse 9: Mike D] 
 You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam 
 You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am 
 With those lies you're telling you're like Toucan Sam 
 But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam 
  
 [Hook-Line:] 
 And if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you! 
 And if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you! 
  
 [Sample:] 
 W-how, what a loser!It's 4am, I've got the Hasenpfeffer Ale 
 I've got nothing to lose, so I'm pissing on the third rail 
 Groggy-eyed and fried, and I'm headed for the station 
 D-train ride to Coney Island vacation 
 This one’s… Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train 
 They'll be kicking out windows, high on cocaine 
 And then I jump the turnstyle, I lost my last token 
 Riding between the cars, pissing, smoking 
 Head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout 
 Policeman told my homeboy, yo, put that crack out 
 You know you light up when the lights go down 
 And then you read the New York Post, Fulton Street, downtown 
 Same faces every day, but you don't know their names 
 Party people going places on the D train 
  
 {Stop that train, I wanna get off...} 
  
 Check it 
 Trench coat, wingtip, going to work 
 And you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk 
 Pickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts 
 I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz 
 Overworked and underpaid, starin at the floor 
 Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors 
 Now stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity 
 Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity 
 $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace 
 The neck, tortoise, your Lees are creased 
 Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin 
 Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin 
 Elevated platform, I'm never gonna conform 
 Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm 
 Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes 
 Over the loudspeaker about the hard times 
 Sat across from a man readin El Diario 
 Riding the train down from the El Barrio 
 Went from the station, to Orange Julius 
 I bought a hot dog - from WHO? George DrakouliasGood times gone and you missed them 
 What's gone wrong in your system? 
 Things they bounce, like a Spalding 
 What'd you think? Did you miss your calling? 
 It's so free, this kind of feeling 
 It's like life, it's so appealing 
 When you've got so much to say 
 It's called gratitude, and that's right 
  
 Good times gone, but you feed it 
 Hate's grown strong, you feel you need it 
 Just one thing, do you know you 
 What you think? That the world owes you? 
 What's gonna’ set you free 
 Look inside and you'll see 
 When you've got so much to say 
 It's called gratitude, and that's rightI have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now 
 Never 
 It's all been leading up to this moment 
 All right now, right here 
 My whole life, right here 
  
 We got rhyme selections in a wide array 
 J'ai des bonbons pour vous manger 
 The party people scream, "Oui, oui, c'est vrai" 
 Cause I got a remote for my bidet 
  
 Now A-D-R-O-C-K 
 I use the microphone like Picasso used clay 
 Down with Freckles from around the way 
 Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay 
  
 I rock on the mic from here to Bombay 
 I give it my best and say come what may 
 Cause everybody's got their dues to pay 
 I'm looking sideways like my man Pele 
  
 Gettin' on like Ali bomaye 
 So fed up with racism today 
 Time to speak up and not turn away 
 Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray 
  
 Dip dip dive so socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be alive 
  
 I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height 
 I shine on the mic like UltraBright 
 Created a monster with these rhymes I write 
 Goatee metal rap, please say goodnight 
  
 Now here's a little something you may not like 
 My dj's name is Mix Master Mike 
 It's a real pity that you people got to bite 
 But I could understand because he sounds so nice 
  
 Reading you the news cause I'm Country Mike 
 Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights 
 Try to keep clear of that hate and spite 
 So I keep my mind still like the still of night 
  
 Now who in the world do you want to fight? 
 It's against the system, we should unite 
 Homophobics ain't alright 
 If you learn to love, then you might love life 
  
 Dip dip dive so-socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be alive 
  
 Bring it back that old New York rap 
 Bring it back that old New York rap 
 Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap 
 Bring it-Bring it back that-Bring it-Bring it back that 
 Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap 
 Bring it back that old New York rap 
 Bring it-Bring it back that-Bring it-Bring it back that 
 Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap 
  
 Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts 
 So many billionares while so many lack 
 So before the poor decide to react 
 Come on party people and share up your stacks 
  
 Now I'm-a break it down to the brass tacks 
 Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch 
 You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch 
 Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch 
  
 I'd like to have a say on the income tax 
 Don't wanna help build bombs and that's the facts 
 No money for health care so what's the catch? 
 The man got you locked with no key to the latch 
  
 Mike and Adam have got my back 
 You bring the mics and we'll bring the raps 
 Turn on the PA and rock your shack 
 Don't smoke cheeba, can't stand crack 
  
 Dip dip dive so-socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be aliveIt's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
 Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all 
 It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
 It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
  
 Lickin'-lickin', uh

 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
  
 Well, Mike d, what's up? 
 Yo, Yauch what's up? 
 Come on, Mike, let's tear it up 
 Hear no evil, see no evil, talkin' no bullshit 
 So many damn people are so damn full of it 
 Keyboard Money Mark, you know he ain't havin' it 
 Just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet 
 I’m convinced that Vince is rippin' me off 
 I think it's his girdle that's tippin' me off 
 Well, Mike D's out back and he's growin' onions 
 I’ve got bigger buns than my man Paul Bunyon's 
 I’ve been going nuts gettin' all cooped up 
 Fully hermitizing but now I’m getting souped up 
 It's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter 
 Settin' my sights and you know what I’m after 
 I’ll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto 
 They'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto 
 Now here's another special of the day 
 I’ve got more spice than the frugal gourmet 
  
 It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
 Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all 
 It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
 It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
  
 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
 Lickin'-lickin', uh 
  
 Well, Mike D (huh), what you got for me? 
 Show these good people what it means to be D 
 Well they call me Mike d with the mad man style I put 
 I put the mic up to my lips and I can scream for a while 
 Created a sound at which many were shocked at 
 I’ve got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet 
 I’ve got the light bulb flashing at the top of my head 
 Never wake up on the wrong side of the bed 
 You're an idea man, not a yes man 
 With a point to make, you're bound to take a stand 
 Cause I’m Pete the Puma, Minnie the Moocher 
 Got every type of flavor or style that will suit ‘ya 
 You know the bass is real fat, because it's gotta’ be like that 
 A snare on the funky tin, and a taste of the high-hat 
  
 Finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all 
 Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all 
 It's finger lickin', it's finger lickin' good, y'all 
 A finger lickin', a lickin', lickin' good, y'all 
  
 Yo, Yauch what's up? 
 Mike D, what's up? 
 Come on Yauch, let's tear it up 
 Well, I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark 
 I grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park 
 ‘Cause I can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue 
 Yeah, I be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum 
 Now I might chew, but I don't bite 
 My ideas are mine when I begin to write 
 In my sleep I’ll be thinking 'bout beats and 
 Getting on the mic and busting some treats and 
 Sportin’ the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before 
 What I’m lackin’ from the mackin’ I can find at the thrift store 
 I won't scuff nor scuffle, just grin as they walk by 
 Take time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly 
 Down some papaya, down with the revolution 
 Always wear my goggles, ‘cause there's so much pollution 
 I can do the Freak, the Patty Duke, and the Spank 
 Gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks 
 I’ll sell my house, sell my car, and I’ll sell all my stuff 
 "I’m going back to New York City, I do believe I’ve had enough" 
  
 Whipped-whipped-whipped cream 
 Whipped-whipped-whipped cream 
  
 We're gonna’ be out of her in a minute 
 So this one goes out to my man, Mario C 
 My brother Adrock, cuttin' it up on the turntable 
 Yeah, finger lickin' good, y'all

 If you pick a rose, well, you might just bleed 
  
 We're originators, you can't feign 
 Ignorance or pass the blame 
 'Nuff rhymes coming out the brain

 And you know I'm mad spunky, and I'm making cash 
  
 Well, I got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets 
 To all you porno peepers who are trying to peep this 
 I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing 
 Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing 
  
 Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave 
 Like virgin pow on the peaks of AK 
 Like a sound that goes to the depths of the soul 
 Well, that's the feeling that I make my goal

 A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my Grape Ape 
 I feel like a winner when I make a mixtape 
 Cause I get ill when I'm on the pause button 
 And I get my fill and you can't say nothing 
  
 More soul on this train than Don Cornelius 
 Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus 
 Just getting on the mic at the monthly function 
 The wires hitting switches connected at the junction 
  
 Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret 
 Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it 
 And so the story goes on and on 
 Down in SD50 'til the early morning

 Step up and get enlightened, educating my mind 
 I play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind

 Step inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on 
 Amalgamating styles so I've got something to grow on 
 Seasons change when it comes their time 
 Fall brings the winter (yeah) and on back to springtime

 Raised on the LES, Manhattan Island

 And then back through Ellis Island goes (yeah) the family tree

 Well, I'm a six point seven on the Richter Scale

 Well, when I get it into the zone 
 I'm gonna take it to a place where I'm all alone 
 Well when I got my shit ah-with my rhyme style's kicking 
 My brain is flowing honest like Abe Lincoln

 Cause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection 
 Listen all y'all, I rap with perfection 
 Because I got the motherfuckin' old school flavor 
 That you savor, so watch your behavior 
  
 [Mike D] 
  
 Talking other dimensions, levels higher 
 Why did Billy Joel say, "We Didn't Start the Fire" 
 Take you to another realm, ugh, another level 
 I've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil 
  
 [MCA] 
  
 I step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime 
 Step from stage to stage to see it all unwind 
 Slowly but surely I seek to find my mind 
 And every wall that I face is of my own design

 Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on 
 I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn 
 Can't rock the house without the party people 
 Cause when we're gettin down we are all equal 
 There's no better or worse between you and me 
 But I rock the mic so viciously 
 Like pins and needles and words that sting 
 At the blink of an eye I will do my thing 
 It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins 
 Like diggin' down deep in the record bins 
 Everybody gettin' down make no mistake 
 Nothing sounds quite like an 8...0...8 
  
 Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!) 
 Super disco, disco breakin' 
 Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!) 
 Super disco, disco breakin' 
  
 Sometimes I like to brag, sometimes I'm soft spoken 
 When I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken 
 The worm is the spice, you bring the sauce 
 And you can kiss my ass you funky boss 
 Now that you got what you want, you want more 
 Well I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door 
 With these funky beats I be goin' head huntin' 
 Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something 
 Cause I can give you all you need 
 A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read 
 Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit 
 "And when I got a new rhyme I just say..." 
 So!

 Transhypnotic, robotic, can't stop it 
 No limits to this style and you know you can't lock it 
 First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it 
 But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket 
  
 [MCA] 
 Well, like a bird floating down on a New York breeze 
 Every thought in the mind is a planted seed 
 So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack 
 Before you know it, boomeranging on back 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Well I'm the king of Boggle, there is none higher 
 I get eleven points off the word 'quagmire' 
 Fools can't see me, that's how it is

 Too fast to really grasp, though we may try 
 Deny 'til we die, ooh my-my 
 These thoughts that mislead and then multiply 
  
 [MCA] 
 Well, second by second and minute by minute 
 It's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it 
 Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise 
 Lies tax to the max and they'll be feeling those vibes 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 So tell me what you need that you have got 
 Fiending on power will make your blood clot 
 It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong 
 That's why, We can't all just get along

 One equals one together like a croquette 
 Whether we have or have not yet met

 Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked

 Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12

 Well, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this 
 I'm the King AdWhammy and you're Dick Butkus

 Got busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno 
 Got over on your girlie cause you know she never says no 
  
 So just get on the mic, just get on the mic 
 Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike! 
  
 Well, Mike D, is a special individual 
 Pullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals 
 Go to the movies, get the Rolos 
 The cholos ridin' slow and low 
 Mike on the mic and bust with the solo 
 Mike, my stromy, don't be so selfish 
 Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish 
  
 {At the fever}Fresh dressed cause I shop at Modell's

 It's hot here, gotta say it's so 
 I got you right where I want 
 Got an honest face so you turn your back 
 When in doubt, run up your attack 
 At one time you were slick and your grill was cold 
 And now funny how the shit gets old 
 You can run, you can run, but it will catch up 
 Like now, see me, I'll show you up 
  
 Now you wanna get back when you had your shine 
 But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme 
 Can't stop, won't stop, no compromise 
 It's a house of cards built out of lies 
 Coming down like a bird floating on the mist 
 Turn on the track, back track, and twist 
 You work hard to climb the list 
 Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift 
  
 I know the danger of a man 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
  
 You're caught now by the skin you're in 
 In a bind now, your thoughts go to all your sins 
 Hits much harder back, better count on that 
 I tell you what we know always holds us back 
 Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop 
 I got in your heart and I shook you up 
 In a bind, now you're caught by the fear setting in 
 Choked on the thought that you done it again 
  
 I Keep the competition in check 
 You draft, your plans, at your drafting desk 
 You try to play to win but now you lost 
 Like clams with no tartar sauce 
 Scheming in the attic 
 Thought you had it 
 So dramatic 
 I got the stats, mathematics 
 Automatic, systematic 
 She's super bad now 
 What'cha, what'cha want now? 
  
 I know the danger of a man (that's danger) 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger) 
  
 I know the danger of a man (that's danger) 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
  
 Don't play no game that I can't win 
 Don't play no game that I can't win[MCA] 
  
 As I develop the awakening mind 
 I praise the Buddhas as they shine 
 I bow before you as I travel my path 
 To join your ranks, I make my full-time task 
 For the sake of all beings I seek 
 The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap 
 Respect to Shantideva and all the others 
 Who brought down the Dharma for sisters and brothers 
 I give thanks for this world as a place to learn 
 And for this human body that I know I've earned 
 And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings 
 For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing 
 There's nothing here that's not been said before 
 But I put it down now so that I'll be sure 
 To solidify my own views 
 And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too 
  
 If others disrespect me or give me flak 
 I'll stop and think before I react 
 Knowing that they're going through insecure stages 
 I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience 
 I'll see it as a chance to help the other person 
 Nip it in the bud before it can worsen 
 A chance for me to be strong and sure 
 As I think on the Buddhas who have come before 
 As I praise and respect the good they've done 
 Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation 
 We need other people in order to create 
 The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate 
 Situations that bring up our deepest fears 
 So we can work to release them until they're cleared 
 Therefore it only makes sense 
 To thank our enemies despite their intent 
  
 The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength 
 A strength from within to go the length 
 Seeing others are as important as myself 
 I strive for a happiness of mental wealth 
 With the interconnectedness that we share as one 
 Every action that we take affects everyone 
 So in deciding for what a situation calls 
 There is a path for the good for all 
 I try to make my every action for that highest good 
 With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood 
 So I pledge here before everyone who's listening 
 To try to make my every action for the good of all beings 
 For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond 
 I vow to do my best, to do no harm 
 And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma 
 And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara[MCA] People how you doin', there's a new day dawnin'

 [MCA] And if you try to dis me, I couldn't give a damn 
  
 Cause I'm rockin' 
 Rockin' 
 Rockin' 
 Rock-rock, rockin' 
 Yeah, get down 
 Rock-rock, rock on 
 Rock-rock, rock on 
 Rock-rock, rock on 
 Mic-mic, mic control 
 Mic-mic, mic control 
 Mic-mic-mic, mic control 
 Yeah, can you get my drift? 
  
 [MCA] Bass from the back of my car feels soothin' 
 [AD] Eight bazookas is what I'm usin' 
 [MD] I'm Mike D, and it's been proven 
 [All] I love it when I see the party people just movin' 
 [MCA] Strapped on my ear goggles and what did I see? 
 [All] But the music brought the people into harmony[Intro] 
 Here's another one for y'all to peep 
 It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C 
  
 [Mike D] 
 See... I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle 
 I laid the bait and then she took the tackle 
 Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster 
 Now the room is spinnin' 'round like the blades of a helicopter 
 I never met a girl that was too finicky 
 If the press has their way, then they're going to finish me 
 You might know this, but you've never been this, see? 
 If I ate spinach I'd be called Spinach D 
 I shed light like cats shed fur 
 Ride around town like I'm Raymond Burr 
 I'm so high that they call me Your Highness 
 So if you don't know me then pardon my shyness 
 I live in the Village, wherever I go I walk to 
 I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to 
 I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it 
 {"It's a trip... it's got a FUNKY beat 
 And I can bug out to it!"}Now my name is Adrock, I've got a story to tell 
 And when I rock the crowd, the crowd we all yell 
 And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell 
 And when I start to rhyme well, I rhyme the rhyme well 
  
 Oh you didn't know, I got the flow 
 I could sing, rap, dance in just one show 
 With the cornbread stuffin', with the Blimpie Bluffin 
 Mother fuckin' Yossi with his goddamn muffins 
 Hey could you please, pass me the peas 
 And let me get a tissue if you think you're gonna sneeze 
 I'm the player and the coach, I'm no roach 
 I bought my grandma a brand new brooch 
  
 Well I'm MCA with a story to tell 
 When I rock the crowd, I rock the crowd well 
 And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell 
 Cause when I start to rhyme, well I rhyme the rhyme well 
  
 Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin' 
 I'll take you to task, everyone of y'all draftsman 
 I'm rehashin' and ain't maskin' 
 Bringin' the beat back, and keepin' it lastin' 
 Keepin' it topnotch, beyond passin' 
 Simmer in the pan cause, I ain't a-flashin' 
 I'm party crashin' so you better batten 
 Down those hatches stop procrastin- 
  
 Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell 
 And when I rock the crowd, the crowd we all yell 
 And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell 
 Cause when I start to rhyme, I rhyme the rhyme well 
  
 Went to the top and never went pop and 
 Came back down but still not stopping 
 I'm not even asking, "Yo, what's cracking?" 
 Serving emcees on a platter like baked Alaskan 
 So start packin', cause I'm back in 
 The game of hip-hop representin' Manhattan 
  
 Now push the pause button, then start ducking 
 Shhhhh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton 
 Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh 
 Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!! 
  
 "And I was trying on the Batgirl costume, what's wrong with that? 
 Now, now I was the Catwoman." 
  
 Hey, Adam. It's Felicia… 
 Hey, Mike. It's Felicia… 
 Hey, Adam. It's Felicia…Yo, Paul, this is Al. You can kiss my ass 
 I ain't interested in you anyhow 
 I'm just interested in the B-Boys 
 So fuck you, my man 
 Yeaaaah, yeah... 
 Who is it? 
  
 Who is the man comin' down your block? 
 It's me you see with the funk in my walk 
 Cause I'm doin' just what I like to 
 Today is my day yeah, and I'mma get nice too 
 You gotta keep movin', and you can't say nothing 
 I'mma keep bouncin' and bumpin' and stuffin' 
 One thing you ought to know 
 Well, I am the maestro 
  
 Yeah, you motherfuckers, I'm all that 
 I see you lookin' at me sayin' 
 How can he be so skinny and live so phat? 
 You know why, cause I'm the maestro 
 Yeah, you know and I'm 
 Move outta my way 
 You got that? 
  
 I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance 
 I'm Mike D, and I'm known for romance 
 I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side 
 And I'm riding down the block, like I'm on a water slide 
 'Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressing my luck 
 'Cause I got nothing to lose, cause I don't give a fuck 
 See I'm a player, I play 
 Don't play to win, I play to show 
 Yeah, I am the maestro! 
  
 Ahh, yeah, I need a little bit of cooperation right about now 
 I'd like to find out who's favorite detective it is 
 Who is this? 
 Is it Mannix? Barnaby Jones? 
 Sombody say Columbo 
 Mickey Mulroney? 
 Is it Cannon... 
 Barnaby Jones? 
 I said that already 
  
 Yeah that's right, ya'll 
 You know I got my own shit 
 See, this ain't America's Most Wanted 
 This is America's Most Mackin! 
 That's right other people all call it, my hit! 
 When I get on there is no stoppin'! 
 Who is this? 
  
 Who is the man, who is the man, who is the man? 
 Who is the man, who is the man, who is the man? 
 Who is the man, who is the man? 
  
 Who is the man? 
 Who's that? 
 The maestro 
 Who is the man? 
 What? The maestro! 
 Give it, give it 
 The maestro 
 Give it up 
 The maestro 
 All three cheers for the maestro!The best in men's clothing 
 Call Paul's Boutique, ask for Janice 
 The number is, ah, 718-498-1043 
 That's Paul's Boutique, and they're in BrooklynOnce upon a time up on this mic 
 MC's be really workin' on what they write 
 With the sound delight we rock all night 
 And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight 
 We're international like Matt Takei 
 Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei 
 Still around the way is where we'll stay 
 Say what we mean, mean what we say 
 Trajectories from the past are taking their toll 
 And what we do now is future molding 
 Columbine bowling, childhood stolen 
 We need a bit more gun controlling 
  
 Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on? 
 We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on 
 Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone 
 We gotta work together it's been too long 
  
 When I get on you scream, "HOO TIGHT!" 
 Rockin' this flow I could go all night 
 I'm not here to fight, or incite 
 I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright 
 I'm getting kind of tired of the situation 
 The U.S. attacking other nations 
 And narration, on every station 
 False elation's got me losing my patience 
 I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way 
 And yes I got to say fuck the KKK 
 And oh yeah hey, how about today? 
 If you want to set if off then let me hear you say 
  
 Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on? 
 We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on 
 Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone 
 We gotta work together it's been too long 
  
 I went to get a loan and they asked my race 
 I wrote down human inside the space 
 It's a disgrace how they try to debase 
 It ain't the banks damn business how my lineage trace 
 Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise 
 I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice 
 With the rhyme precise, the word is nice 
 So please pass me the Riunite on ice 
 Well let's go to work and not get berserk 
 Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt 
 Try to smooth it out like Levert 
 Keep the mind on alert and not revert 
  
 Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on? 
 We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on 
 Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone 
 We gotta work together it's been too long{Alright, he's scratching it right now 
 Cuttin' the record back and forth against the needle 
 Back and forth, back and forth, makin' it scratch 
 But let me tell you something 
 Don't try it at home with your dad's stereo 
 Only under hip-hop supervision, alright?} 
  
 {Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh?} 
  
 Because I grab the microphone and I pick it up 
 And then I fuck it up and then I turn it in 
 And then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound 
 And then you know I’m gonna get down 
  
 Eat a Scooby snack and take disco nap 
 Because I’m shopping at Sears, cause I don't buy at the Gap 
 Sending this one out to all the funky inspirations 
 Pretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations 
  
 Well, I’m working on rhymes, they're coming line by line 
 Trying to put what I feel into word and rhymes 
 I've got a feeling coming on, I’ve got to make some shit 
 A little something stupid, for the twisted and sick 
  
 Because I drive like a maniac on the streets 
 And I don't give a fuck cause I’ve got the beats 
 Got my nuts swingin' from left to right and 
 Right to left and I’m death defying 
  
 {Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh?} 
  
 I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak 
 Here's "The Payback;" Keep going strong, like since the way-back 
 I try to be myself but I lose track 
 Because the shit gets complicated, now I’ve got to get back 
  
 As we learn to breed love for one another 
 In these times of melding cultures 
 I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent 
 I know this music comes down from African descent 
  
 Because I don't need a magic potion 
 Let me talk about backfield in motion 
 My girls got cheeks for weeks and I’m happy 
 You know I’m a sneak like my old grand pappy 
  
 Well I gotta give thanks to my man, Archie Shepp 
 For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step 
 So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am 
 And I talk to the people like Les McCann 
  
 {Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this 
 Alright hear this} 
  
 I ask God for a rhyme or two 
 A little somethin' for the wise as well as the fool 
 A little somethin' to effect a little taste of change 
 For the together and strong as well as the deranged 
  
 I'll do you right like Bobby Knight 
 And then I’m rappin’ on the mic to the Broadway light 
 Stomp my hands, I clap my feet and 
 I'm buggin' off Yusef Lateef 
  
 I got a match to my ass and I’ma keep it lit 
 And well I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt 
 I'm rushin' around town takin' care of my functions 
 Always got one more thing so forget about function 
  
 We create this world and the problems go on 
 Create our lives and the things that go wrong 
 So to the deaf, the blind look around and listen 
 To what it is you want and for what you're wishin' 
  
 {Alright hear this 
 Oh yeah 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this 
 So you wanna be an MC, huh? 
 Alright hear this}"Uh, funky baby 
 Lay it on me now 
 Not so hard, man" 
  
 Yo… 
 I've got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits (Lay it on me now) 
 Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots 
 More updated on the hip-hop lingo (Not so hard, man) 
 My favorite New York Knick was Harthorne Wingo 
 Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card 
 Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte (Lay it on me now) 
 Peepin' out the colors, I be buggin' on Cezanne 
 They call me Mike D, Joe Blow, the Lover Man 
 Well, your face turns red as your glass of wine 
 That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time (Lay it on me now) 
 Girl, you should be with me you should drop that bum 
 Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Stripe Gum 
 With that big round butt of yours 
 I'd like to butter your muffin--I'm not bluffin' 
 Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin' 
 ("And what it") 
 Stuffing, stuffing 
 Stuff it, buddy{*scratching: "Aw yeah!"*} 
 There's a girl over there {*"Aw yeah!"*} 
 With long brown hair {*"Aw yeah!"*} 
 I took her to the place... 
 I threw the mattress in her face... 
 Took off her shirt {"*fresh"*} 
 Took off her bra... 
 Took off her pants {"*fresh"*} 
 You know what I saw {"WICK WICK WACK!"} 
  
 {*all laughing*}Boom, yeah, the world mash up 
 Well 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Things get hectic quick 
 From the satellite dish to your joy stick 
 It's the night of the living cable box 
 Wires coming up from around the block 
 Remote control to change the station 
 But that won't change your situation 
 Have you seen what I mean 
 I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams 
 So I say this rhyme built by design 
 To take you beyond space and time 
 Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal 
 The man pushing buttons on remote control 
  
 [Hook] 
 Re-mote, control 
 Remote control 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Until your back's up against the wall 
 You never know yourself that much at all 
 So you've got to share your love with a friend 
 That's all that you've got left in the end 
 Living in this city of pure confusion 
 People mislead by their own illusion 
 All this action, no satisfaction 
 We're all linked together like a chain reaction 
 Play or fold, love is bold 
 What is the future that will unfold? 
 Some like it hot, others like it cold 
 But we all want to hold the remote control 
  
 [Hook] 
 Re-mote, control 
 Re-mote, control 
 Re-mote, control 
 Re-mote, control 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Things get hectic quick 
 All of the sudden I'm in the thick 
 Too much drama all around 
 Distractions booming in sensurround 
 Like a rainy day's Earth it won't sit still 
 Sliding on down a hill 
 Sometimes life seems to stall 
 So never be ungrateful y'all 
 So I got a little something for your pay per view 
 Like Don King, I've got the crazy hair do 
 We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol 
 Controlled on Earth by remote controlYo, what's up? 
 Sucka emcees, check the footnotes, ya'll 
 Word up. Ready, bite 'cha ass 
 Oh, word? 
  
 Yo what the schnitzel, we're back 
 Shit's getting duller and duller and that's a fact 
 I don't care what you heard or care what you seen 
 I swear it wasn't me in Bear magazine 
 Because I'm not that hairy, oh contrary 
 I go with the flow though the tempo varies 
 So twist the cap and pop the cork 
 You know it's Adrock, made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 What the ponytail, I don't eat snail 
 I'll steal your keys and then I'll check your mail 
 Cause I'm the creepy crawler that be crawling your walls 
 And I'm the shot caller when it comes to shot calls 
 And I'll be rockin' parties from block to block 
 And block party to party the neighborhoods on lock 
 So hide your eyes, wait, I saw you looking 
 The name's MCA, made in downtown Brooklyn 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo what the parsley, parsley to the teeth 
 I'm a rhyme style writer, you're a rhyme style thief 
 I may be paranoid, you tried to fade me 
 Here's a song for you, "Lady" 
 Make you bug out like you don't know what to do 
 Your momma says, "Shame on you" 
 When you're dancing with your crew 
 So get that poor chicken up off your fork 
 My name's Mike D, made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo what the falafel, you gotta get up awful 
 Early to fool Mr. Furley 
 And that's word to Aunt Shirley and you could 
 Stick your head in the toilet give yourself a swirley 
 Listen up, biters - go please stop 
 While I'm politicin' at Murray's Cheese Shop 
 Believe what you heard, when you talk 
 You know it's Adrock made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 What the phone booth, word to hair mouse 
 You're on the corner and you're selling a hog's tooth 
 Don't mean to dis but I've got to point out 
 The hogs tooth belong inside the hog's mouth 
 Like Ernest Shackleton said to Ord Lees 
 I'll have dog pemmican with my tea 
 Now pass me the wok cause I'm cookin' 
 The names MCA, made in Downtown Brooklyn 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo, what the doofus, say good night 
 You're Snidely Whiplash, I'm Dudley Do-you-right 
 Times are off the hinges, leave your 2-way at the door 
 We're all up the creek, a long way from shore 
 I'm not walking around, looking to get you cake 
 The D is for Diamonds, not for Drakes 
 This is not a fantasy and I'm not Mr. O'Rourke 
 The name's Mike D, made in New York 
  
 Oh word?You Can't, You Won't And You Don't Stop

 Pull Up At The Function And You Know I Kojak

 And That's Alot Because I've Got My Share 
 I've Got A Hole In My Head And There's No One To Fix It 
 Got To Straighten My Thoughts, I'm Thinking Too Much Sick Shit 
 Everyone Just Takes and Takes, Takes, Takes, Takes 
 I've Got To Step Back, I've Got To Contemplate 
 I'm Like Lee Perry, I'm Very

 The Disrespect To Women Has Got To Be Through 
 To All The Mothers And Sisters And the Wives And Friends 
 I Want To Offer My Love And Respect To The End

 To Send My Rhymes Out To All Nations

 It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know 
 Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due 
 M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You 
 Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight 
 "If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright" 
 I'm Feeling Good To Play A Little Music 
 Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It 
 And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On 
 A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone 
 I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom 
 For Bringing Me Into This World And So On 
 I can't stand it I know you planned it 
 I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate 
 I can't stand rocking when I'm in here 
 Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear 
 So while you sit back and wonder why 
 I got this f*cking thorn in my side 
 Oh my, it's a mirage 
 I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage 
 So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin' 
 You'll shut me down with a push of your button? 
 But yo I'm out and I'm gone 
 I'll tell you now I keep it on and on 
 'cause what you see you might not get 
 And we can bet so don't you get souped yet 
 You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage 
 I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage 
 Why; our backs are now against the wall 
 Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage 
 Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage 
 Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage 
 Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage 
 I can't stand it, I know you planned it 
 But I'm gonna set it straight this watergate 
 But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place 
 Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face 
 But make no mistakes and switch up my channel 
 I'm buddy rich when I fly off the handle 
 What could it be, it's a mirage 
 You're scheming on a thing - that's sabotage 
 1-2 1-2 Keep It On 
 Listen To The Shit Because We Kick It Until Dawn 
 Listen To The Abstract Got It Going On 
 Listen To The Ladies Come On And Let Me Spawn 
 All Your Eggs Then You Go Up The River 
 Listen To The Abstract That Freaky Nigga 
 I'm Ad Rock And I Shock And I Tick And I Tock 
 And I Can't Stop With The Body Rock 
 See I've Got Heart Like John Starks 
 Hitting Mad Sparks 
 Pass Me The Mic 
 And I'll Be Rocking The Whole Park 
 I'm The M To The C To The A And It's A Must 
 The Rhymes That We Bust On The Topic On Lust 
 And My Moms Is Not Butt, But F*ck It 
 Let Me Get Down To The Rhythm 
 Yes I'm Getting Funky And I'm Shooting All My Jism 
 Like John Holmes, The X-rated Nigga 
 Listen To The Shit 'Cause I'm The Ill Figure 
 Nobody's Getting Any Bigger Than This 
 Get It Together, Get It Together 
 Phone is Ringing, Oh My God 
 Get It Together 
 See What's Happening 
 Ad Rock's Down With The Ione 
 Listen To The Shit Because Both Of Them Is Boney 
 Got To Do It Like This Like Chachi And Joanie 
 Because She's The Cheese And I'm The Macaroni 
 So Why All The Fight And Why All The Fuss 
 Because I Ain't Got No Dust 
 Yea, You Know I'm Getting Silly 
 I've Got A Grandma Hazel And A Grandma Tilly 
 Grand Royal prez And I'm Also A Member 
 Born On The Cusp In The Month Of November 
 I Do The Patty Duke In Case You Don't Remember 
 Well, I Freak A Funky Beat Like The Shit Was In A Blender 
 Well, I'm Long Gone Word Is Born 
 Don't Need A Mother F*cking Fool Telling Me Right From Wrong 
 I Don't Think I'm Slick Nor Do I Play Like I'm Hard 
 But I'm a Drive The Lane Like I Was Evan Bernhard 
 And I've Working On My Game Because Life Is Taxing 
 Got To Get It Together And See What's Happening 
 Get It Together, Get It Together 
 Get It Together 
 See What's Happening 
 I Go One Two Like My Name Was Biz Mark 
 But I Had To Do The Shit Just Let Me Embark 
 On The Lyric And The Noun And The Verb 
 Let's Kick The Shit Off 'Cause Yo, I'm Not The Herb 
 Well, It's Not The Herb But The Spice With The Flavor To Spare 
 The Moog With The Funk For Your Derriere 
 While We're On That Topic, Yes I Like To Mention 
 When It Comes To Boning I'm Representing 
 Spacing, Zoning, Talkin' On The Phone And 
 My Brain Is Roaming And I Don't Know Where It's Going 
 Talking Lots Of Shit A Little Tweaking On The Weekend 
 I've Got To Get Him By The Reigns Because I Know That I'm Freaking 
 Well, I'm A Funky Skull And I'm A Scorpio 
 And When I Get My Flow I'm Dr On The Go 
 So Q-tip, What You On The Mic For 
 Because I Had To Talk About The Times That I Rhyme 
 And When M.C.S Come In My Face, I'm Like Mace 
 Because I Back Them Off With The Quills 
 Nigga 'Cause I Tell You, Nigga 'Cause I'll Keep You Under Prills 
 Resting On Nine One One Sixteenth Ave Off The Farmes Boulevard 
 I'm From Manhattan M.C.A.'s From Brooklyn 
 Yea, M.C.A., Your Shit Be Cooking 
 Praying Mantis On The Court And I Can't Be Beat 
 So, Yo Tip, What's Up With The Boot On Your Feet 
 I've Got The Timbos On The Toes And This Is How It Goes 
 Oh One Two, Oh My God 
 One Two, Oh My God, I've Got Some Shit 
 I've Got The Kung Fu Grip Behind My Green Trap Kit 
 Never Ever Ever Smoking Crack 
 Never Ever Ever F*cking Wack 
 I Eat The F*ckin' Pineapple Now & Laters 
 Listen To Me Now, Don't Listen To Me Later 
 F*ck It 'Cause I Know I Didn't Make It F*ckin' Rhyme For Real 
 But, Yo Technically I'm As Hard As Steel 
 Gonna Get It Together, Watch It, Gonna Get It Together Ma Bell 
 I'm Like Ma Bell, I've Got The Ill Communications 
 [Instrumental] 
 I Can Hear The Trumpets Blowing Screaming Out The End Of Time 
 Look Around And Listen And You'll See Every Sign 
 The Waters Are Polluted As The Forests Are Cut Down 
 Bombing And Drilling Deep Below The Ground 
 Check The Prophecies From Around The World 
 And Look Around Now As It All Unfurls 
 Look Into Yourself And See What Goes On 
 Get A Feeling In Your Heart Of The Right From Wrong 
 Because The Mother Earth Needs To Be Respected 
 Been Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected 
 Race Against Race, Such A Foolish Waste 
 It's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face 
 And At The End Of The Wars, What Was The Cost 
 It's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost 
 We Are One With Her As She Is One With Us 
 It's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust 
 As Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day 
 Everyone Affecting Everyone In Every Way 
 We're All Citizens Of The World Community 
 All Here Together And We're Searching For Unity 
 Over The Years, I've Grown And Changed So Much 
 Things I Know Now Years Ago, I Couldn't Touch 
 There Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again 
 But I'm Glad That I Did 'Cause I've Learned From Them 
 I Just Try To Stay Present Right Here, Right Now 
 No Worries, No Fears And Without Any Doubts 
 It's About Time 
 'Cause In These Times, These Changing Times 
 A Transition Is Occuring And I Am Not Blind 
 As The Pendlum Swings A New Age We Enter 
 And With Every Swing, It Draws Closer To The Center 
 Yes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love 
 Things Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove 
 But We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another 
 To Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another 
 And The True Key Is A Trust In Self 
 For When I Trust Myself, I Fear No One Else 
 I Took Control Of My Life, Just As Anyone Can 
 I Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand 
 The Past Is Gone, The Future Yet Unborn 
 But Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On 
 I Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late 
 I Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways 
 I Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget 
 Someday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet 
 Someday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One 
 And It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done 
 'Cause We Long Behind The Rage Learning From The Pain 
 The Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain 
 I'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is 
 To All Creation And The Life We Live 
 I'm Not Preaching Bull Shit, Just Speaking My Mind 
 'Cause I'm Here Now And It's About Time 
 "When Two Are Served, You May Begin To Eat" 
 Gene Futterman 
 Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up 
 And Then I F*ck It Up And Then I Turn It In 
 And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound 
 And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And 
 Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap 
 Because I'm Shopping At Sears, 'Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap 
 Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations 
 Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations 
 Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line 
 Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes 
 I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit 
 A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick 
 Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets 
 And I Don't Give F*ck 'Cause I've Got The Beats 
 Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And 
 Right To Left And I'm Death Defying 
 Alright Hear This 
 Alright Hear This 
 I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak 
 Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back 
 I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track 
 'Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back 
 As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another 
 In These Times Of Melying Cultures 
 I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent 
 I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent 
 Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion 
 Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion 
 My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy 
 You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy 
 I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Shep 
 For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step 
 So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am 
 And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann 
 I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two 
 A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool 
 A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change 
 For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged 
 I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight 
 And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light 
 Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And 
 I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef 
 I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit 
 I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt 
 I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions 
 Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function 
 We Create This World And The Problems Go On 
 Create Our Lives And The Things That Go Wrong 
 So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen 
 To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing 
 [Instrumental] 
 Moon Me! 
 So, Just Sit Back And Max And Relax 
 Off Tracks That I Kick, Come On And Give It Up 
 'CauseI Get Funky Like Diaper Rash 
 And You Know I'm Mad Spunky And I'm Making Cash 
 I've Got Sex Rhymes Like Victoria's Got Secrets 
 To All You Porne Peepers Who Are Trying To Peep This 
 I'm Like Al Goldstein, I'm All About Screwing 
 Lead My Team To Sixty Wins Like My Man Pat Ewing 
 Like Getting Shot Out The Barrel Of A Wave 
 Like Virgin Pow On The Peaks Of A.K 
 Like A Sound That To The Depths Of The Soul 
 Well That's The Feeling That I Make My Goal 
 A Little Wine With My Dinner So I'm In The Grape Ape 
 I Feel Like A Winner When I Make A Mix Tape 
 Because I Get Ill When I'm On The Pause Button 
 And I Get My Fill And You Can't Say Nothing 
 More Soul On This Train Then Don Cornelious 
 Got The Mad Subwoofer Pumping Bass For Your Anus 
 Just Getting On The Mic At The Monthly Function 
 Wires Hitting Switches Connecting At The Junction 
 Perlman's Got Beats And It Ain't No Secret 
 Dante Found His Shit But You Know He Freaked It 
 And So The Story Goes On And On 
 Down In S.D. 50 'till Early Morning 
 Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid 
 Building Rhymes Like Buildings, Like A Stonehenge Druid 
 Step Up And Get Enlightened, Educating My Mind 
 I Play The Tape Forward, It's Not Time To Rewind 
 Step Inside The Mother F*cker And I Get My Flow On 
 Amalgamating Styles So I've Got Something To Grow On 
 Season's Change When It Comes Their Time 
 Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime 
 Well, It's The King Ad Rock And That's Who I Am 
 Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam 
 'Cause I'm Thin And I Don't Grin 
 But Check It Out People 'cause I Love To Go And Swim 
 Caught Up On The Phone Fiber Optic Distraction 
 Information Super Highway Got The Brain Contraction 
 I'm The Kung Fu Master Vs. The Sumo Wrestler 
 Got The Beats In Manhatten You Can Hear In Westchester 
 Well, My Mother Was Born Out In Coney Island 
 Raised On The L.E.S. Manhatten Island 
 My Dad Camo Out From Detroit And They Had Me 
 And Back On Through Ellis Island Goes Through The Family Tree 
 Well, I'm A Six Point Seven On The Richter Scale 
 I've Got Rhymes Gallot And Then I Never Fail 
 Like Gravy To Potatos, Luke To Darth Vader 
 I'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later 
 You See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts 
 You Say Mike D. And I Say Mic These Nuts 
 I've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello 
 Adam Yauch Grab The Mic 'Cause You Know You're My Mellow 
 Well When I Get It Into The Zone 
 I'm Gonna Take It To A Place Where It's All One 
 My Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking 
 My Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln 
 'Cause I'm The F*ckin' Rythm Ace With The Rhyme Selection 
 Listen All Y'all I Rap With Perfection 
 Because I Got The Mother F*ckin' Old School Flavor 
 That You Savor So Watch Your Behavior 
 Talking Other Dimensions, Levels Higher 
 Why Did Billy Joel Say We Didn't Start The Fire 
 Take You To Another Realm, Another Level 
 I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil 
 I Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime 
 Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind 
 Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind 
 And Every Wall That I Face Is Of My Own Desig 
 Glendale Boulevard Boulevard 
 Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At 
 It's Where I'm At, Where I Live 
 Check It Out Because My Head Is Like A Siv 
 And We Turn It Out 
 [Instrumental] 
 Drink A Six Pack And Then You Play Som Ball 
 Walking Down The Stairs And Then He Starts To Fall 
 Add On Two Joints And Then He Starts To Sweat 
 Two Hundred Seventy Five Punds That You Can't Forget 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Spend All Your Money On Your Health Insurance Plan 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Keep On Getting Bigger Because You Know That You Can 
 Why Do You Force Yourself On Top Of That Girl 
 Laugh With All Your Buddies Because It's A Man's Man's World 
 Someday That Shit Will Come Back To You 
 You've Been Throwing Your Weight Around And 
 Your Shit Is Through 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Going Nowhere, Got No Master Plan 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Heart Attack 
 Weighs In At Two Seventy Five 
 Yeh My Man Is Lucky To Be Alive 
 Smokin' And Drinkin' Too 
 My Man The Heart Attack Man Is Gonna Be Running Over You 
 Got No God Damn Respect 
 Had To Put The Big Big Bitch-Ass In Check 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Lungs Full Of Tar And A Stomach Full Of Spam 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Time To Change Your Ways Heart Attack Man 
 What do we know about partying or anything else? 
 I Don't get Blind I Don't Drink Wine 
 I Took A Sledge Hammer And I Broke My Nine 
 Because My Record Is Mine, Word Is Born I Rhyme 
 And Everey Day I Write The Book Down Line By Line 
 I'm Feeling Good When I Do It Like This 
 So Come On And Turn It Up Because You Can't Resist 
 Because I'm Back With Another Track Wich You Lack 
 'Cause Things Is Wack And That's A Fact 
 Because I'm On Time, You're Shouting Rewind 
 You Know It's Ad Rock That's Blowing Your Mind 
 My Shit Is Rough And You Know It Is So Damn Tough 
 I'm Getting Intense, Not Talking Nonsese 
 I Made Up My Mind, Not Sitting On The Fence 
 I Don't Always Know The Right From The Wrong 
 I Do My Best To Figure It Out And Work It Out In The Long 
 I Try To Do A Lot More Than I Can Chew 
 Balance Out My Ambition's What I've Got To Do 
 Because You Hide In Broad Day Light, A Parasite 
 A Hypocrite, You Take A Peek Quick 
 You Turn Your Nose Up, You Think You're High Up 
 You Play It Real Safe And Now Your Shit's Fake 
 I Seen You Hawking And Then You Clock My Style 
 And Then You Try To Play It Off Like You Think You're Wild 
 D.I.Y. That Means Do It Yourself 
 I Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help 
 Don't Sit Back And Say Good Enough 
 Keep On Striving, Reinventing But Keeping It Off 
 The Cuff 
 So Kick The Level Up Cuhootnified 
 Mackadocius Vibes Positively Fortified 
 I'm Throwing Rhymes Down Kicking Them Downtown 
 Traveling High Speed Through The Underground 
 I Kick It Free Style, Make It Worth Your While 
 I've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File 
 I'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again 
 New York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In 
 A Blast From The Grasshoff Awhile It's Been 
 Stepping Into The Future Again 
 I'm Straight From The 88 To 93 To 94, I'm Out The Door 
 Step Into The Party With The Fila Fresh Gear 
 People Looking At Me Like I Was David Koresh Here 
 Kicking Rhymes From The Heart 'Cause That's Where I'm At 
 F*ck The Bullshit, Be It Far From Me To Pop That 
 In The Search For Truth, I Go A Lot Of Ways 
 There's Not A Lot Of Peace, That I Find These Days 
 I Try To Stay Cool, I Try To Stay Calm 
 But My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb 
 So I'll Say It Like The Group Huggy Bear 
 There's A Boy-Grrrl Revolution Of Wich You Should Be Aware 
 You Can't Dis Me, It Ain't Worth It, B 
 You Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See 
 Cause I Don't Play That, I Know Who I Am 
 For A Minute, I Did But Now I'm Back Again 
 I'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G 
 Well I Stopped Smoking Cheeba 
 And That Was Part Of The Key 
 We've Got Fire, We Need Water 
 There ain't No Water So I Guess I Ought To 
 Leave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind 
 And I'm Blind And I'm Working Overtime, So Check It 
 I Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book 
 And I Know You Want To Take Another Look 
 [Tibetan Gregorian Chants - Instrumental] 
 As I Develop The Awakening Mind I Praise The Buddha As They Shine 
 I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path To Join Your Ranks 
 I Make My Full Time Task 
 For The Sake Of All Beings I Seek 
 The Enlighted Mind That I Know I'll Reap 
 Respect To Shantideva And All The Others 
 Who Brought Down The Darma For Sisters And Brothers 
 I Give Thanks For This World As A Place To Learn 
 And For This Human Body That I Know I've Earned 
 And My Deepest Thanks To All Sentient Beings 
 For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing 
 There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before 
 But I Put It Down Now So I'll Be Sure 
 To Solidify My Own Views And I'll Be Glad If It Helps 
 Anyone Else Out Too 
 If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack 
 I'll Stop And Think Before I React 
 Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages 
 I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience 
 I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person 
 Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen 
 A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure 
 As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before 
 As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done 
 Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation 
 We Need Other People In Order To Create 
 The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate 
 Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears 
 So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared 
 Therefore, It Only Makes Sense 
 To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent 
 The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength 
 A Strength From Within To Go The Length 
 Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself 
 I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth 
 With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One 
 Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone 
 So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls 
 There Is A Path For The Good For All 
 I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good 
 With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood 
 So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening 
 To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings 
 For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond 
 I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm 
 And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma 
 And The Enlightened Ones Who've Graduated Samsara 
 [Instrumental]What's pleasing to the eye 
 In the delusion of my sight 
 Is not what I find when I reach into the light 
 I have lost my mind 
  
 I'm walking through time 
 Deluded as the next guy 
 Pretending and hoping to find 
 That distant peace of mind 
  
 I don't know 
 Who does know? 
 There is no 
 Where to go 
  
 It's not so simple as I try to wish 
 But then again what is? 
 There is no other worthy quest 
 So on I go 
  
 I don't know 
 Who does know? 
 There is no 
 Where to go 
  
 I don't know 
 Who does know? 
 Where to go 
  
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
 I don't knowEverybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 I sneak a chicken tikka 
 Masala at a gala event 
 I represent that's stupid, that's for sure 
 You be like, "Oh yeah Adam, real mature" 
 I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye 
 All this cheese is gonna make me cry 
 Gorgonzola, provolone 
 Don't even get me started on this microphone 
 Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka 
 I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper 
 On a track so sick it'll make you feel all queasy 
 Make you do like Fred Sanford with "I'm comin' Wheezy!" 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
 On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis 
 Got the edge and I've got the advantage 
 If you could see things from my vantage 
 Point then you could better understand this 
 I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night 
 I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight 
 When it comes to panache I can't be beat 
 I got the most style from below 14th street 
 Internationally known as the Keebler Elf 
 Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf 
 I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti 
 Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps 
 Posing like you're rolling with that camp 
 In layman's terms let me break it down 
 You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder 
 I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back 
 So Jeckle and Rush, go back to Lefrak 
 I'm a simple man like Chauncey the Gardner 
 Working 9 to 5 Dolly Pardner 
 Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama 
 Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama? 
 Goodness gracious golly gee 
 Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie! 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 I'm gonna' tell on you!Geesh! 
 Yeah, all the time 
 New school, old school (a'ight!) 
 Keep it on and on 
  
 Uhh, yeah 
  
 Goin' off the hook like Latrell Spreewell 
 I've got the ill technique so you know me well 
 We be kickin' bass, all up in your face 
 And when it comes to beats, well, I'm the rhythm ace 
  
 Now if you check my pulse, it beats skull snaps 
 I keep all my rhymes in my Le Sportsac 
 So what if I'm a ham and cheese on rye? 
 I got to do my thing and that's no lie 
  
 Well, ice is cold and fire is hot 
 When it comes to competition, we've got them locked 
 U-N-I-T-E 
 A little shout to Ian and little Zoe 
  
 One can wonder why, but can't deny 
 If we could work it out, it would be so fly 
 We'll never know unless we try 
 So tell me, party people, what's your Zodiac sign? 
  
 Breakdancers of the world, unite! 
 "Oh shit… yeah" 
  
 Bboys of the world, unite! 
 "Well wicked" 
  
 I went inside the deli, and my man's like, what? 
 I write the songs that make the whole world suck 
 I need to break it down every chance I get 
 So, Ssshhh, we keep it raw on the set 
  
 Automation, circulation 
 This is for the people all around the nations 
 I got books with hooks, and it looks like rain 
 Would someone on the Knicks please drive the lane? 
  
 Now rhymes are mantequilla on a track by us 
 I've got to keep my mind clear so I don't bust 
 If you got bad breath, then maybe try Scope 
 And if you wash your ass, you best use soap 
  
 People of the world, you realize 
 We got to get together and harmonize 
 I feel I'm comin down with the boogaloo flu 
 "Explain to me really what doctors must do" 
  
 Ravers of the world, unite! 
 Come on now 
  
 We're the scientists of sound 
 We're mathematically puttin' it down 
 When lightning strikes, best grab a ground 
 Got to get up to get down 
  
 I've got the terminator style with a touch of the tweak 
 Technics 1200's, I'm known to freak 
 I don't like to fight, I don't carry a piece 
 I wear permanent press so I'm always creased 
  
 Mike D with the rump shakin' action 
 Do it like this for the intergalaction 
 I practice asana daily so I'm very flexible 
 I'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual 
  
 Shouts to Rach and my brother Matthew 
 In Money-Makin', it's how we do 
 I be smokin' roaches in the vestibule 
 In the next millennium, I'll still be old school 
  
 High roller, big baller 
 I call 'em crullers but you know they're called crawlers 
 I keep it movin' to the broad daylight 
 Bgirls of the world, unite! (a'ight!) 
  
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
 Keep it on and on, keep it on and on 
  
 Hahahaha... 
 Ah, with the rump shakin' actionOh 
 Yeah 
 Hey Yo 
 This is a dedication to all you back stabbing biting MC's 
 Scratching like you got fleas 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 Yo. We watchin' you son 
 We up on the roof 
 Down in the celler 
 And up in the crawlspace 
 Listen fool, I got my eye on you son 
 What? 
  
  
 There's a party going on in here for real 
 I got more product than Ron Popeil 
 So deal with that, troop; We're troopers 
 The only air time you get is on bloopers 
 Beastie Boys in the place, up in the space 
 So renovate or evacuate 
 You better think twice before you start flossin' 
 I been in your bathroom often 
 Taking punk MC's out I'm all about 
 My to-do list today is turn the party out 
 Getting hot in here, no room to breath 
 I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep 
 No I'm not Herman Munster nor Dr. Spock 
 I go by the name of the King Adrock 
 So here's a match my ass and your face 
 Listen when I tell you, dog; 
 I'm in your crawl space 
  
 You're in front of my house and you know that's wack 
 Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack 
 You suckers try to front like you've got the force 
 But I'll slay like Vader, sip you for a first course 
 Don't even get me started on intercourse.. 
 *Ahhhh!* 
 Don't step into my zone or even periphery 
 Can't grab a hold of my style, it's too slippery 
 The way you act a fool, son, you can't erase 
 Andyou running on your way like steeple chase 
 You tried to take my title, put it back in place 
 But now you're busted wearing panties and lace 
 Steeling my style from my trophy case 
 But my drive's secure like on an army base 
 You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase 
 But you ain't never gonna catch me; 
 I'm in your crawl space 
  
 Schematics, blueprints and microfilm 
 Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm 
 Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier 
 And this extends beyond the Tri-State Area 
 Omnipresent and omnipotent 
 My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents 
 This means huge compared to very small 
 You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl? 
 Cause these rhymes are two hundred proof 
 They're like anvils lined up on a roof 
 Waiting to drop on your corny melon 
 Cause were not buying what you're selling 
 First you want to battle then you start to whine 
 You're looking hungry, it must be snack time 
 So run home where you feel safe 
 But don't sleep, Cochese 
 I'm in your crawl spaceThis is it y'all, some nasty shits for ya 
  
 Jump out the window onto a parade balloon 
 My style is iller than the goblins in "Troll 2" 
 Cause I'm the type of MC with the most pizzazz 
 You're stealing my book like I was Grandmaster Caz 
 Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics 
 Rhyme about expectorants, y'all don't see it 
 Soothsayer, not a player, rhyme sayer extreme 
 Burn like fire when I step on the scene 
 I've got shark's teeth so I can bite your head 
 I've got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead 
 I've got wings like a dragon when I'm flying above 
 Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough 
 So step back and check yourself 
 This MC's got weapons that'll ruin your health 
 So if you're feeling strong, then reach for yours 
 My book is my shield and my mic is my sword, sword, sword... 
  
 Long burn the fire 
 The truth shall set you free 
  
 Now it's Adrock rappin', I'm back again 
 Like a Big Mac attack on your gut and that's wack, my friend 
 I'm a maxer relaxer and I'm chillin' 
 I take that shit serious like Jerome to grillin' 
 I burn you to a crisp, sucker, back up off the toaster 
 I make you sick like at Kenny Rogers Roaster 
 See this rap thing is all about the braggadocio 
 I check my rear view, MCs ain't gettin' closer 
 People think I'm slow cause I'm just I'm underchallenged 
 See me, you're like, "Man, that's remarkable talent" 
 Live round the clock like Disco Donut 
 I'm like a tailor cause I got the thing sewn up 
 Or a proctologist, I move asses 
 Got so much heat that I fog your mom's glasses 
 Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants 
 You heard me rappin' now watch me dance 
  
 Long burn the fire 
 The truth shall set you free 
  
 Save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters 
 Above the haters, you can hear our laughter 
 Like Willis Reed or Elton John 
 We done been in the game and our game's still on 
 It's not Tic Tac Toe or Operation 
 Just holding it down like the gravitation 
 To all the heads that said, "No can do" 
 Adrock's in the bath filled with chocolate fondue 
 Straight up nuts like my name is Mike Bazzini 
 Bonafide household name like Sergio Tacchini 
 "Wasn't we here back on Raising Hell?" 
 Running wild like rats in the Taco Bell 
 On the mic I spit, the match it's lit 
 Mike Dino, the Jewish Brad Pitt 
 Making music for librarians to burly jocks 
 The rapper Mike D, known for my curly locks{*DJ scratches: "Good times" for 10 seconds*} 
  
 DJ Hurricane! 
 When Mike D's in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 I go AWOL! 
 Adrock's in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 I go AWOL! 
 When MCA's in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 I go AWOL! 
 When Hurricane's in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 He goes AWOL! 
  
 Cey City in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 Home-one, what'cha gonna do? 
 Captain Pissy in the house… what'cha gonna do? 
 Dust Brothers in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 Mike G in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 Mookie in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 Hollis Crew... what'cha gonna do? 
 Jarvis in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 When Killa Cutty in the house, what'cha gonna do? 
 Jazzy Jay in the house, Bad Brains in the house 
 Original Concept in the house! 
 Yo, good night Amsterdam 
 {"Now I want you all to break this down"} 
  
 [[Outro] 
 To all the girls, all the girls... echoes for 20 seconds 
  
 {"You liked it?"} 
 {"Well, some of it seemed good!"}Good morning 
 Time to get up and go to work 
  
 I ride on the bus into the city every day 
 I sit on my seat and I dream myself away 
 I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too 
 But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, I'm on Third Avenue 
 Won't you take me away and take away me 
 Won't you take me away and take away me 
 Yeaaah 
 Alright, get off the bus 
  
 "You're wild man... WILD!" 
  
 "That's insane, you're stupid" 
 (Huh?) 
 "You should sleep late man; 
 It's just much easier on your constitution"I don't like your attitude, boy 
  
 What makes you feel 
 And why you gotta be 
 Like you got the right 
 To look her up and down 
 What makes this world 
 So sick and evil? 
 I, don't, want to know 
  
 What makes you feel 
 Like you've got whip appeal 
 Who made you the judge and jury? 
 Ain't you never heard of privacy? 
 What makes this world 
 So sick and evil? 
 You figure it out 
 You figure it out 
  
 You figure it out[Intro: All] 
 How you feeling, Ad-Rock? 
 Well, I'm feeling well 
 Bonafide, qualified, with a story to tell 
  
 How you feeling, Mike D? 
 Well, I feel all good 
 All day it's how we play in the neighborhood 
  
 How you feeling, MCA? 
 Well, I feel right 
 I speak my words on the track cause the track sounds tight 
  
 Well, if you're feeling good and you're feeling right 
 Uh, somebody step up and grab the mic 
  
 [Verse 1: Ad-Rock] 
 Now hello everybody and how you been? 
 It's Ad-Rock rappin' on the microphone again 
 I got grace, class, style, finesse, and debonair 
 Murdalize motherfuckers cause I just don't care 
 The Emcee Whisperer, kinda like a trainer 
 I take sucker rappers, I put 'em through a strainer 
 Like macaroni cause the shit sound cheesy 
 Watch how it's done, boy, it looks easy 
 The non-stop, goin' off, kingpin, microphone boss 
 Do my own thing, you can't afford the cost 
 Of my style, take you through a turnstile 
 Cause I'm live and direct, and I'm wicked and wild 
 Because I'm back on a roll, got total control 
 I flow like the water out your toilet bowl 
 Your style is cheap, boy, just like a Dutch 
 You know you're not smokin' on the microphone much 
 There's a certain special talent that I never lack 
 Huh-ha, huh-ha, and that's a fact 
 Cause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac 
 You better break a wishbone cause we never wack 
 Said we're never that and that is that 
 And we're the nonstop disco powerpack! 
 Uh, that's right, we go all night 
 Who gonna be next to bless the mic? 
  
 [Interlude: All] 
 Now this is the way we run it down 
 We're gettin' you high on the funky sound 
 This is the way we get it on 
 B-Boys in the house 'til the break of dawn 
  
 [Verse 2: Mike D] 
 See, I mix my style up like a cement mixer 
 Smooth and fix ya, like a rhyme elixir 
 I said, "Yo, sound man, make Mike's mic louder" 
 Don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder 
 I max and relax, champagne mojito 
 Don't go commando, don't know bandito 
 Je m'appelle Michel Pérignon 
 Me and Claude in the chateau and we got it going on 
 Quincy's in the hot tub like it's '73 
 Looking over his shoulder and he's looking at me 
 I'm all white in the face, towel around my waist 
 What's up with that watch inside that glass case? 
 I go to make my move, sneak out of the place 
 Undetected, not leaving a trace 
 Party's done, microphone's wrecked 
 Wine's been drunk and heads been checked 
 I see one last profiterole and make my play 
 And pass the microphone to MCA 
  
 [Verse 3: MCA] 
 Nonstop, on the top, and you clock, when we rock 
 Never fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop 
 (So c'mon everybody get down... yeah) 
  
 Now there's a spot check, hit the deck count down 
 Cause I'm a break it down for you, how we run it down 
 Pound for pound, keep the bass lines round 
 I seen you watchin', clockin', jockin' my sound 
 But, for real, I'm real glad I grew up in hip hop 
 Still got mad love for a record called "Beat Bop" 
 It meant a lot spinning on my Walkman 
 Shout out to the African Bam 
 And to the S to the P the double O-N-Y 
 The one MC who you can't deny 
 I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire 
 Sit down to write and the pen breathes fire 
 Construct a rhyme with specific intent 
 Flowin' from the brain cells, right through the pen 
 And then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic 
 Words flowin' so cold, turn water to ice 
 Come through the wire, saturate the tape 
 You put me in the mix, nice it up with the plate 
 And then they press it on wax, sell it in the store 
 The DJ spin the record out on the dance floor 
 Comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum 
 Brain cells get lit, then you hear where we're comin' from 
  
 [Outro: All] 
 Well, Ad-Rock (huh) get it on 
 We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn 
 Mike D, (huh) get it on 
 We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn 
 MCA, (a-yeah) get it on 
 We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn 
 Beatsie Boys in the house don't stopIf you don't like the news then press eject 
 Baby Davis, getting older, can't take a rain check 
 It's time to let 'em know what we expect 
 Stop building SUV's, strung out on OPEC 
  
 Hold up, wait up, you know, we come correct 
 You wanna change things up, well, hey, then get set 
 It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck 
 It's easier to break things than build it correct 
  
 We've got a president we didn't elect 
 The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect 
 And still the US just wants to flex 
 Keep doin' that, what, we gonna break our necks 
  
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 You gots to chill 
  
 Ah, yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check 
 Tearin' down each other is what they expect 
 If you want love, well, hey, that's a bet 
 We've got to give before we can get 
  
 Waiting like a batter who is on deck 
 When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck 
 So let's calibrate and check our specs 
 We need a little shift on over towards the left 
  
 I don't really know but I suspect 
 I think it's due time that we inspect 
 How they get their information and their facts are checked? 
 Another press conference someone's talking out their neck 
  
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 You gots to chill 
  
 So step up to the window and place your bets 
 Is the US gonna keep breaking necks 
 Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex 
 And the military muscle that he wants to flex 
  
 By the time Bush is done what will be left 
 Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque 
 Environmental destruction and the national debt 
 But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest 
  
 What the real deal, why you can't connect? 
 Why you hating people that you never met? 
 Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect? 
 Why not open your mind for a sec? 
  
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 It takes a second to wreck it 
 It takes time to build 
 You gots to chill 
  
 It takes 
 It takes 
 It takes 
 It takes 
 It takes 
 It takes 
  
 {The idea is to keep the green alien landing craft from taking your humans from the ground and changing them into mutants 
 A mutant is very dangerous to you because he flies faster than you do and shoots at you}Here's a little diddy about a good guy I know 
 He's named the Heart Attack Man 
 And you know, he weighs in pretty hefty 
 My man's like two hundred seventy... 
 (Laughing) 
 How much he weigh? 
 (Laughing) 
 He's like the guy in the Hefty bag commerical 
  
 Okay, okay, let's take it from here 
  
 Drink a six pack and then you play some ball 
 Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall 
 Add on two joints and he starts to sweat 
 Two hundred seventy-five pounds that you can't forget 
  
 Cause he's a... 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Spend all your money on your health insurance plan 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Keep on getting bigger because you know that he can 
  
 Why do you force yourself on top of that girl? 
 Laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's man's world 
 Someday, that shit will come back to you 
 Throwing your weight around and that shit is through 
  
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Going nowhere, and got no master plan 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
  
 Weighs in at two seventy-five 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
 Yeah, my man is lucky to be alive 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
 Smokin' and drinkin’, too 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
 My man, the Heart Attack Man, is gonna be running over you 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
 Got no goddamn respect 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
 Yeah, you'd better put your big, big bitch ass in check 
 (Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack) 
  
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Lungs full of tar And a stomach full of Spam 
 Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man 
 Time to change your ways, Heart Attack Man 
  
 Oh, what do we know about partying or anything else?[Instrumental]Jeb, get away from the bar-b-que, man 
 Don, get the hell away from that thing 
 Dunce, give me a kiss 
 Won't you come and give me a kiss?[Intro: Biz Markie] 
 That's right, comin' to ya all day and all night 
 They are--I don't have to mention them cause they're superstars 
 We gonna do a little something like this 
 Aaaahh! 
  
 Dear Alex and Marilyn 
 They're Lovey and Thurston Howellin' 
 The grasshopper unit is prowlin' 
 And Rufus is back home growlin' 
 For all of y'all that be dozin' 
 On Hornblower's lederhosen 
 Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen 
 And then the Swiss Hall of Fame, he goes in 
 Cause when he's out in space carousin' 
 Pick up my mic and start joustin' 
 My name plate medallion 
 Says never trust a Hal 9000 
  
 Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm 
 Cause I get down, cause I get down 
 Cause I get down, get down, get down, get down, get down 
  
 Check the horizontal hold and check the tint 
 Are these three fools back at it again? 
 Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint 
 Nothin' but sparks ignitin' 
 Check two, one-two, mic testin' 
 This one goes out to Dechen 
 Rise fallen fighters, take your stance again 
 Don't think too much about the color of skin 
 Order in vegetarian shark's fin 
 Try to keep my life nonviolent 
 Mario, rewind the tape and "Punch 'em in!" 
 Like Chuck D with the where you never been, I'm in 
  
 Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm 
 Cause I get down, cause I get down 
 Can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm 
 Cause I get down, cause I get down 
  
 I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep moving, movin' on 
  
 Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it 
 Oh, my-my, something's really wrong 
 Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it 
 Oh, my-my, something's really wrong 
  
 The PA sound is deafenin' 
 Bitin' MCs, I'm oustenin' 
 With spinach in your teeth, you're grinnin' 
 So on your way out, please take a mint 
 Got the studio to throw a craze in 
 The basslines Yauch just lays in 
 This song is the grass you're grazin' 
 Add a little flange and phase in 
 Don't get mad cause I'm beguilin' 
 I'm off the hook, so don't bother dialin' 
 They're gonna put me in the b-i-n 
 And if I die, notify the next of kin 
  
 Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop 
 Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop 
  
 Movin' on 
  
 Fresh!Butcher me on the court 
 Too many elbows to report 
 Now you're poking me in the eye 
 Bill Laimbeer motherfucker, it's time for you to die 
  
 Tough guy, it's time to check yourself 
 Dribbling the ball like the Biz can be bad for your health 
 Tough guy, what you gotta prove? 
 Moving like an elephant, that's your favorite move 
 Tough guy, your shit is going out 
  
 Tough guy 
  
 Box me out with your fat ass 
 Throw me around like a bounce pass 
 You've got a tombstone hanging over your dick 
 Cause a minor earthquake when you throw a moving pick 
  
 Tough guy, you think you're like the Shaq 
 Keep running around, you'll catch a heart attack 
 Tough guy, what are you giving me 
 The way you're playing ball, you'll stop me from living, B

 Someday, we shall all be one 
  
 Jesus Christ, we're nice"Bet you're wondering what's been going on 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind" 
  
 My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on 
 We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong 
 And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme 
 When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong 
  
 At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention 
 That I am well aware of your wack intentions 
 To usurp my prose you so-and-so 
 It's my primary bone of contention 
  
 I tell you, everybody, I've had it 
 With all these people with static 
 I'll go insane if it don't rain 
 Sucker MCs are problematic 
  
 I love it when you hit those switches 
 A curve ball's what my pitch is 
 So here we—here we come 
 Like dum-ditty-dum 
 I keep all five boroughs in stitches 
  
 "You're right, man" 
  
 Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound 
 Sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex 
 It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex 
 Until you feel no pain inside your brain 
 All your worries are soothed by the sound effects 
  
 Read it in the Post and the Daily News 
 Listen everybody lets show improve 
 Don't let me begin about heroin 
 Living six feet deep just ain't the move 
  
 We're giving you soul power 
 I like it sweet and sour 
 When it comes to rhymes and beat designs 
 I'm at the control tower 
  
 Tell me what makes you so afraid 
 Of all these people you say you hate 
 Just give it one time for your mind 
 And let's try to negotiate 
 C'mon, let's try to negotiate 
 Let's try to negotiate 
  
 "Bet you're wondering what's been going on 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"I don't see things quite the same as I used to 
 As I live my life, I've got just me to be true to 
 When I find that I don't know about just what to do 
 I turn and look within—to see what I should do 
 Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip 
 A lot of people making music that to me ain't shit 
 So I ask creation for rhymes for this jam 
 Gimme lickle solo and I'll take the mic stand 
  
 Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe 
 Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe 
  
 Yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day 
 I see the light on the horizon's not fading away 
 Gonna shine from within, like a bright white sun 
 No need to hide and no place to run 
 Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind 
 So you can move and groove, and feel the beat of the time 
 Sense the power in the air as it starts to move 
 You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose 
  
 Love vibe 
 Contemplation time 
 Love vibe 
 Intuition time 
 Love vibe 
 Evolution time 
 Love vibe 
 Resolution time 
  
 Free your mind, it's time for good times 
 And let yourself move, it's a time to shine 
 Spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside 
 Breaking fool with no need to hide 
 I got the music cuttin' through me 
 Takin' control of my soul 
 I can't hold back, I've got to let go 
  
 Stand together (people come together now) 
 It's about time (we've got to get together now) 
 Stand together (people come together now) 
 I said it's about time (we've got to get together now), come on 
 Stand together (people come together now) 
 I said it's about time (we've got to get together, y'all) 
  
 I think we should stand togetherOur evening began 
 In Peter Sichel's comfortable study 
 In his New York townhouse 
 Where the candlelight was just right 
 The hi-fi was in the background 
 And the wine, was delicious 
  
 [Woman] What's the secret, Peter? 
 [Peter] Naturally, I'll say it's the wine 
 [Woman] Mmmm, it does go well with the chicken! 
  
 Delicious again, Peter[Intro] 
 Whoahhh-ohhh 
  
 [Verse One:] 
 Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss 
 Funky boss, funky boss, get off my back (Hah, get it) 
  
 Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss 
 Funky boss, funky boss, get off my back 
  
 What in the fuck is hap-pen-ning? 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss 
 Funky boss, funky boss, funky bald-ass boss 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah, that's right 
 Funky bald motherfuckers! 
 'Cause everywhere gonna be nowhereThe shit with this bitch 
 Yo, I said I'm calling you, B 
 Yo, B, it's the phone 
 Yo, B

 "Here's my supervisor. He'll help you." 
 Yo, man. Where's the supervisor at?

 ("These pussy crumbs are making me itch!") 
  
 Ah, Cookypuss, HEY!

 ("Aaahhh, B-E-A-S-T-I-E go!") 
  
 ("My real name is

 ("My sister's name was") 
 Scratch 
  
 Cookypuss, cook, cook, cook, scratch, scratch 
 Oh, cook, cook, cook, cook, oh, cookypuss 
  
 ("And my mother got to call us for dinner") 
  
 Yo, yo, yo!

 Cookypuss. Pussy crumbs? What are pussy crumbs? 
 ("Take me home and eat me, yeah!")

 "Hello, Carvel?" 
 Yo, man. Cookypuss there? 
 "Who?"

 [MCA] 
 You talk and talk and you just can't stop 
 A word comes to mind, it's "crock" 
 What you say is lackluster 
 Plus it seems you're trying to pull a filibuster 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Yeah, right, yeah, ok 
 Tell me something new to start the day 
 Said "See you later, when you coming home?" 
 When you comin' home? 
 It's a gift, it's a curse, it's the telephone 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Now let's start over with a nice clean slate 
 Please stop stressing with the hurry-up-wait 
 Heard you the first time, that sounds great 
 But back up out my space, ok? 
  
 (Yeah-yeah, right-right) ok 
 Ok 
 Ok 
 Ok 
 Ok 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Wrapped in pink ribbon, so pretty 
 My name's Mike D from New York City 
 I guess it's all in the mind 
 What I leave behind 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Thought you'd be smooth like a nice Nutter Butter 
 But I start to cringe, every word that you utter 
 Yes, you said you are a big deal 
 But, money, calm down, for real 
  
 [MCA] 
 Got to control my mind 
 Got to slow down, rewind 
 What is going on in my head? 
 Why's the sky gone red? 
  
 What is going on in my head? 
 Why's the sky gone red? 
 What is going on in my head? 
  
 What is going on in my head? 
 Why's the sky gone red? 
 What is going on in my head? 
 Why's the sky gone red? 
  
 What is going on in my head? 
 What is going on in my head? 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Now I don't give a fuck who the hell you are 
 Please stop shouting in your cellular 
 I never asked to be part of your day 
 So please stop shouting in your phone, ok? 
  
 [MCA] 
 You lie like a plainclothes cop 
 Take a minute, take a look, and take stock 
 Take a minute, get your mind unlocked 
 Get open and I'll throw you the rock 
  
 [Mike D] 
 What's going on in my head? 
 And why has the sky gone all red? 
 Be kind, rewind 
 At least tell me what it is I did 
 Or just say what should I say 
 Hmm... ok? 
  
 (Yeah-yeah, right-right) ok 
 Ok 
 Ok 
 Ok 
 OkOne, two, three... 
 The Beatsie Boys 
 They are, they comin' home 
 They comin' home 
 Oh, they comin' home 
 To all their fans, they are, they comin' home 
 They're comin' home, oh, they're comin' home{Children of the earth!} 
  
 [MCA] 
  
 Well, I can hear the trumpets blowing, screaming out the end of time 
 Look around and listen, and you'll see every sign 
 The waters are polluted as the forests are cut down 
 Bombing and drilling deep below the ground 
 Check the prophecies from around the world 
 And look around now as it all unfurls 
 Look into yourself and see what goes on 
 Get a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong 
 Because the Mother Earth needs to be respected 
 Been far too long that she's been neglected 
 Race against race, such a foolish waste 
 It's like cuttin' off your nose to spite your face 
 And at the end of the wars, what was the cost? 
 Well, it's clear that the earth was the one who lost 
 We are one with her, as she is one with us 
 It's unreal how she is treated so unjust 
 As our planet grows smaller each and every day 
 Everyone affecting everyone in every way 
 We're all citizens of the world community 
 All here together and we're searching for unity 
 Over the years I've grown and changed so much 
 Things I know now, years ago I couldn't touch 
 There are things I've done that I wouldn't do again 
 But I'm glad that I did cause I learned from them 
 I just try to stay present, right here, right now 
 No worries, no fears, and without any doubts 
  
 Well, it's about time, it's about time 
 It's about time, it's about time, it's about time 
  
 Cause in these times, these changing times 
 A transition is occurring, and I am not blind 
 As the pendulum swings, a new age we enter 
 And with every swing, it draws closer to the center 
 Yes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love 
 Things must run their course, so we push and we shove 
 But we're here to work it out, in one way or another 
 To find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another 
 But the true key is a trust in self 
 For when I trust myself, I fear no one else 
 I took control of my life just as anyone can 
 I want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand 
 The past is gone, the future yet unborn 
 But right here and now is where it all goes on 
 I know we can fix it and it's not too late 
 I give respect To King and his nonviolent ways 
 I dream and I hope and I won't forget 
 Someday I'm going to visit on a free Tibet 
 Someday I'm going to see us all joined as one 
 And it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done 
 Cause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain 
 The love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain 
 I'm sending loving light to all that is 
 To all creation and the life we live 
 I'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind 
 Cause I'm here now and it's about time 
  
 Well, it's about time, it's about time 
 It's about time, it's about time, it's about timeI don't get blind, I don't drink wine 
 I took A sledge hammer and I broke my nine 
 Because my life is mine, word is bond I rhyme 
 And every day I write the book down line by line 
 I'm feeling good when I do it like this 
 So come on and turn it up because you can't resist 
  
 Because I'm back with another track in which you lack 
 Cause things is wack and that's a fact 
 Because I'm on time, you're shouting rewind 
 You know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind 
 My shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough 
  
 I'm getting intense, not talking nonsense 
 I made up my mind, not sitting on the fence 
 I don't always know the right from the wrong 
 Do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long 
 I try to do a lot, more than I can chew 
 I balance out my ambitions what I got to do 
  
 Check it, better believe it y'all 
 Check it, better believe it y'all 
 This is rough and tough 
  
 Cause you hide in broad day light, a parasite 
 A hypocrite, you take a peek quick 
 You turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up (uh) 
 You play it real safe and now your shit's fake 
 I seen you hawking and then you clock my style 
 And then you try to play it off like you think you're wild 
  
 D.I.Y., that means do it yourself 
 I don't sit around waitin' for someone's help 
 I don't sit back and say "Good enough" 
 I keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff 
 So I kick the level up cuhootnified 
 Mackadocius vibes, positively fortified 
  
 I'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown 
 Traveling high speed through the underground 
 I kick it freestyle, make it worth your while 
 I've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file 
 I'm feeling good now, back home again 
 Well, New York City is the city that I feel at home in (woo) 
 A blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been 
 Stepping into the future again (yeah) 
  
 Uh, and now I'm straight from 88 
 To 93 to 94, I'm out the door 
  
 Step into the party with the Fila fresh gear 
 People looking at me like I was David Koresh here 
  
 Kicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at 
 Fuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that 
  
 In the search for truth, I go a lot of ways 
 There's not a lot of peace that I find these days 
 I try to stay cool, I try to stay calm 
 But my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb 
 So I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear 
 There's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware 
  
 You can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B 
 You put yourself down and you don't even see 
 Cause I don't play that, I know who I am 
 For a minute I did but now I'm back again 
 I'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G 
 Well, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key 
  
 We, we, we've got fire, we need water 
 There ain't no water, so I guess I ought to 
 Leave you broke in a comatose state of mind 
 And I'm blind and I'm working overtime, so check it 
 I keep my rhymes in my little black book 
 And I know you wanna take another look 
  
 *This is rough and tough*Like a flag at half-mast as frames click fast 
 Not a thing will last as past is past 
 Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn 
 Used over and over till they were tired and torn 
 Like a broken clock that can't tell time 
 Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes 
 Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand 
 Like a band that planned and planned and planned 
 And flew down like a raven in the dark of night 
 And snatched up the worm helpless to fight 
 And brought it back to the nest, singing microphone check 
 One two one two, this is just a test 
 One two one two, this is just a test 
 One two one two, this is just a test 
  
 Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long 
 Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong 
 It's like fudge and caramel, they're not the same 
 And it's a shame, all you talk is game 
 You act like a diamond waiting to be set 
 In a gold ring, as if, I bet 
 As time goes by in this give and take 
 As long as I learn I will make mistakes 
 Now, what do I want? What do I need? 
 Why do I want it? What's in it for me? 
 It's the imagery of technology 
 Is what you get is what you see 
 Don't worry your mind 
 When you give it your best 
 One two one two this is just a test 
 One two one two, this is just a test 
 One two one two, this is just a test 
  
 Come on-come on, come on-come on 
 Come on-come on, come on-come on 
 Come on-come on, come on-come on 
 Come on-come on, come on-come on[Intro] 
 Yeah, that's right! 
 It's time, to set the record straight 
  
 [Verse One] 
 Ain't nobody got to spell it for me 
 I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see 
 I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear 
 But if I have to I'll yell in your ear 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 Check this out 
 Ain't nobody got to spell it for me 
 I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see 
 I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear 
 But if I have to I'll yell in your ear 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Soul fire, soul fire 
 And we ain't got no water 
 We don't got no water 
  
 [Outro] 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
 No time for makin' up a monster to sell 
 Time for livin', time for givin' 
 No time for makin' up a monster to sellOnce again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
 My best friend's my own worst enemy 
 Electricity and gravity 
 Oh, my god, now take a look at me 
 My lifeline's run by AT&T 
 They got their wires all up in me 
 Is push and pull the way it's got to be? 
  
 Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
 My best friend's my own worst enemy 
 Electricity and gravity 
  
 Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
 Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
 Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
 Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me 
  
 You know, I wish that there was some way 
 That I could be outside playing basketball in the rain 
 And not get wet. Now wouldn't that be great, hmm?I kick out the jams and tell you who I am 
 I'll make you shake your ass like Les MaCan (yeah) 
 And then you're out talking shit like Yosemite Sam 
 You've got the elephant feet like Les McCan 
  
 Up the crack of dawn, I'm on my way 
 We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay 
 Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand 
 I'm changing my middle name to first Trem 
  
 I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite 
 I've got holes in my mouth where my teeth should be 
 You ask, Whatever happenened to the rappin' duke? 
 I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth 
  
 Taking care of my functions, still smokin' up the shrubery 
 I stopped eating chicken cause the shit was too rubbery 
 My produce, organic, from my own yard 
 Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard 
  
 Vibes, vibrations 
 Vibes, vibrations 
  
 Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb 
 Waking up my long joint, ready to get some 
 Looking at my board and my old boots 
 Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth 
  
 And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt 
 I give a shout out -- so where you at? 
 But don't get souped, Matthew, cause I'm-a take ya 
 Horatio Park right now and I'm-a shake ya 
  
 Give me the fresh count, you know that I'm stressed out 
 I need some inspiration, so get the best out 
 Like Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line 
 Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time 
  
 Good vibes flowing all around 
 Not a worry in mind as the friends around 
 A shout out to Linda, riding pow forever 
 Well the 'Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather' 
  
 Well I smoke a bag of rat weed cause I don't care 
 And I'm waxing old ladies out of their underwears 
 I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties 
 I'm giving it to grandma, making her crazy 
  
 I might be a white boy, but I'm no goofy 
 Got beats like Babalu on "I Love Lucy" 
 I'm not like the Skipper on "Fantasy Island" 
 I'm more like Captain Stubing when I go buck whylin' 
  
 The Cire Traverse out to Death shoot 
 Or STH when they let me back at the Deuce 
 Cause I can't get enough of that funky stuff 
 When the going gets rough, ain't going out in the sluff 
  
 Down with Bubble Gum and the Ninth Creation 
 You get on down, we've got the sound sensation 
 Kid Fresh is back from the eighties 
 And we're doing it for the ladies 
  
 Vibes, vibrations 
 Vibes, vibrations 
  
 We got Vibes, vibrations 
 We got Vibes, vibrations 
 Vi...vi...Back on the scene for the people's delight 
 You want peace for the people, then you say all right 
 'Cause George W's got nothing on we 
 We got to take the power from he 
 When I'm on the mic, I feel good to go 
 Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa 
 So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know 
 And my zodiac sign is Scorpio 
 Look what the cat dragged in 
 The crème de la crème without the skim 
 So take a rest and mind your own biz 
  
 And that's it, that's all, that's all there is 
  
 Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
 That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
  
 One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan 
 Let's go to work, get those hands clappin' 
 I'll make you bounce, rock, roll and skate 
 Don't underrate how I operate 
 It ain't what you say, it's what you mean 
 Intention leads to action, that is my theme 
 So pay attention now as I begin to recap 
 Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back 
  
 Some rhymes go flat, but mine go fizz 
 I got no time for the drama, 'cause stress is for kids 
 'Cause when you're dead and buried, well, you got no biz 
  
 And that's it, that's all, that's all there is 
  
 Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
 That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
  
 Brand new 
  
 The time and place for the mind is here and now 
 Keep the mind present, less to worry about 
 But like the hammer to the nail, hit the nail on the head 
 Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead 
 'Cause I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh 
 T-shirt and no pants, and I dance the bugaloo 
 Like George Whipple on New York One 
 Got a hairy ass and that's no fun 
 I'm in the rhyme zone, a different time zone 
 And on the microphone, you know that I'm at home 
 It's time we looked past all our differences 
 An' that's it, that's all, that's all there is 
 Come on 
  
 Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
 That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
  
 An' that's 
 Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
 That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for youKick it! 
  
 You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go 
 You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says "No!" 
 You missed two classes and no homework 
 But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk 
  
 You gotta fight 
 For your right 
 To party 
  
 Your pop's caught you smokin', man, and he says "No way." 
 That hypocrite smokes two packs a day 
 Man, livin' at home is such a drag 
 Now your mom threw away your best porno mag 
 Busted! 
  
 You gotta fight 
 For your right 
 To party 
  
 You gotta fight 
  
 Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear 
 I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair 
 Your mom busted in and said "What's that noise?" 
 Aw, mom, you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys 
  
 You gotta fight 
 For your right 
 To party 
 You gotta fight 
 For your right 
 To party

 Hold up. Goddammit, this thing. Alright, wait 
 Hold on, Adam. This thing keeps fallin' off 
  
 Mike D: 
 Woo! Doin' it big! Ah-ah! 
 I'm like the lyrical, mathematical genius 
 Splashing like lime juice, you've never seen this 
 Internationally known, the longest, the leanest 
 Shout-out to one José Nenis 
  
 Ad-Rock: 
 I hit 'em with the rhyme and the rhyme don't stop 
 We got the beat and the beat go drop 
 The ping pong paddle make the battle go pop 
 Now take a look around this spot 
  
 MCA: 
 I'm seeing every detail like an over-cranked camera 
 Sleestaks in the back say 'Damn ya' 
 You say 'I can't' and I say 'Why can't ya?' 
 Chopping the track in the--in the land of... 
  
 Beastie Boys: 
 You wanna buy this 
 You wanna take that 
 Wanna-wanna try this 
 Wanna-wanna make that 
 You can't abide this 
 You wanna fake that 
 Take a look around you

 Take a look around you 
  
 Mike D: 
 There's a bird in here 
 That's my DJ, not Doctor Brassiere 
 Dropping bombs like a bombardier 
 Like cacao, it's a chocolatier 
  
 Ad-Rock: 
 We're giving y'all a lil slice of heaven 
 B Boys bringing it back to A7 
 Deal with the schism, ride on the rhythm 
 Sweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em 
  
 MCA: 
 I'll stage a coup and usurp your position 
 Cause--cause like a Mormon, I'm on a mission 
 We're audible-visible 
 Cadence is lyrical 
 Got the mental and physical 
 When the moment is critical 
  
 Beastie Boys: 
 You wanna buy this

 Woo! Watch out! 
 In the back of the bus...gonna bust! 
 Lee Majors style

 Bill Piedmont with the Kung-Fu grip 
 Haymaker, roundhouse, show can't continue 
 At the roller rink down in Virginia 
  
 Ad-Rock: 
 Oh, did I spill the beans? 
 I see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans 
 Von Dutch cap, Ugg boots to match 
 The word gets out, you can't take it back 
  
 MCA: 
 I'm just a pause tape competition expert winner 
 Just a doggone, long-armed, tall yarn spinner 
 You want a battle? Easy now, star 
 My DJ's so nasty, he needs a sneeze guard 
  
 Beastie Boys: 
 You wanna buy this 
 You wanna take that 
 Wanna-wanna try this 
 Wanna-wanna make that 
 You can't abide this 
 You wanna fake that 
 Take a look around you 
  
 You wanna buy this 
 You wanna take that 
 Wanna-wanna try this 
 Wanna-wanna make that 
 You can't abide this 
 You wanna fake that 
 Take a look around youYeah, a butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day 
 As I feel this reality gently fade away 
 Riding on a thought to see where it's from 
 Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come 
 Smoke paints the air 
 Swirling images through my mind 
 Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind 
 And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting 
 As time slips by 
 Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky 
 And I sit 
 And I think to myself 
 And on the horizon, the sun light begins to climb 
 And it seems like it's been so long since he shined 
 But I'm sure it was only yesterday 
  
 A cold chill of fear cut through me 
 I felt my heart contract 
 To my mind I brought the image of light 
 And I expanded out of it 
 My fear was just a shadow 
 And then a voice spoke in my head 
 And she said, Dark is not the opposite of light 
 It's the absence of light 
 And I thought to myself 
 She knows what she's talking about 
 And for a moment I knew 
 What it was all aboutTime is runnin', I'm passin', I'm passin' and runnin' 
 I'm runnin' and passin' 
 So you all better get right at this time 
 Cause there might be no next time, y'all 
  
 (Instrumental)There's no confusion in her conclusion 
 She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion 
 Her final decision is perfection and precision 
 She's grade A class, number one in her division 
  
 Cause she's on it 
 And she's on it 
  
 She acts like a nag, I don't know how it started 
 Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded 
 It gets annoying so high on the tip 
 If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt, she'd be hard on his ship 
  
 Cause she's on it 
 Cause she's on it 
  
 Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop 
 She'll do what's best just to reach the top 
 She studies real hard, all night she'll cram 
 In school she majors in advanced Def Jam 
  
 Cause she's on it 
 And she's on it 
 Cause she's on it 
 Cause she's on it 
 Cause she's on it 
 'Cuase she's on it 
  
 She's cold in the winter and cool like ice 
 Sometimes she gets loose, sometimes she gets nice 
 Her heart starts beatin', her hands get clammy 
 Cause she used to be stucked up, now she's on my jammy 
  
 Cause she's on it 
 And she's on it 
  
 Her bedroom eyes, they start to twitch 
 But she won't front cause she's got that itch 
 She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please 
 Instead of counting sheep, cold counting Beasties 
  
 Cause she's on it 
 Cause she's on it 
 And she's on itOn and on to the break of dawn 
 On and on to the break of dawn 
 On and on to the break of dawn 
 On and on to the break of dawn 
  
 Now let me introduce myself, I'm Adrock 
 No matter what you order, well, I got it in stock 
 The doody rhyme thing, well, we got it on lock 
 Top off the look with the Argyle sock 
  
 Take it from me now, I'm gonna give it all I got 
 I take a licking, still tick-tick-tock 
 But smoked salmon ain't old school lox 
 I go to Peter Brady and I buy Greg's sox 
  
 It's Mike on the mic and I'm known to please 
 Stinky nasty like the head cheese 
 Caps, gowns, honorary degrees 
 Rhymes fresh pressed like '83 Lees 
  
 You can't stop, you got to keep on 
 You can't stop, you got to keep on 
  
 I mean that's all I got, except I've just got... 
 Even Michael Diamond him never learn 
 Atop him head, him have a curly perm 
  
 Tissue up my nose and my dick's in a cast 
 I don't wanna talk about it, past is past 
 All you crusty punks that are into Crass 
 Go and take a shower and wash that ass 
  
 We rock nonstop here in New York City 
 Sweet on the mic, looking so damn pretty 
 Served by me, well, it must feel shitty 
 Weird thing to say here, it goes tough titty 
  
 I've got rhymes in a pitcher and it's time to pour 
 I'm at the tee and I'm screaming "Fore!" 
 Hit into your party as I declare war 
 Roberta Peterson's got a spine like a dinosaur 
  
 You can't stop, you got to keep on 
 You can't stop, you got to keep on 
 You can't stop, you got to keep on 
  
 On and on to the break of dawn

 We're we're we're 
 We're the b-boys, we don't regret 
 There's nothing wrong with your TV set 
 We're a gettin loose 
 We couldn't be harder 
 Our beats are bigger and better and longer 
 Got real rock shit 
 You must admit 
 Not fake, not false, not counterfit 
 I can play the drums, I can play guitar 
 Not just b-boys, but real rock stars 
 Rock, rock rock... 
  
 When we borrow your shit, you better hit the deck 
 You'll walk the plank for your dis 
 Respect, respect, respect... 
 If you front on the Rock, best run and hide 
 If you got static, we'll take it outside 
 And you start to get dulled by the Beastie Boys 
 Use real rock beats, show off big toys 
 Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds 
 So we'll pump up the beat and make it real loud 
 Loud... 
 A, then scrach it... 
 Heavy metal tension running through your blood 
 Too much rock step off the pud 
 Too much treble mid-range and bass 
 The beat's so hard, it'll dick your face 
 You'll crush out hard rock hard beats hard 
 Rock cold rythms for fanatic freaks 
 Some people say this has been done 
 We're hear, we're now 
 And the battle’s won 
  
 Fists... 
 Fists of fury in an MC bout 
 Rock so hard it'll knock you out 
 The very first blow is a kick in the snout 
 The beat's so def that you better beware 
 When you're talkin' bass right in your face 
 The walls crumble down, destroying the place 
 The finishing touch is the bokasat-slam 
 The final blow in the five finger jam 
  
 Some... 
 Sometimes I write rhythms 
 Sometimes I write rhymes 
 He writes his and I write mine 
 His rock 'n roll rythms are raunchy and raucous

 For your boomin' granny with the boomin' system 
 Said I love ya, won't leave ya, so you got to listen 
 See I’m talkin' about the way that I’m feeling 
 You're so lovely, lengthy, and so appealing 
 A sassy, sophisticated, sexy lady 
 Well I’m 26 and you're 80 
 The clock is ticking so you better not front 
 We can go to my place or we could smoke a blunt 
 Well you're a golden girl, just like Bea Arthur 
 Just turn down the lights so we can go farther 
  
 Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny 
 Boomin' granny, good and plenty

 Sophisticated, and so mature

 Because I want ya, and I need ya 
 Hey boomin' granny, you could be my teacher 
 And I could be your pet, bet 
 Listen old lady, I’m gonna make ya sweat

 She's got electric boots, a mohair suit 
 You know I read it in a magazine 
 Oh, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets 
  
 Hey kids, plug into the faithless 
 Maybe you're blinded 
 But Bennie makes them ageless 
 We shall survive, let us take ourselves along 
 Where we fight our parents out in the streets 
 To find who's right and who's wrong

 Call yourself an MC, but what's your truth? 
 You Gotta let it loose inside the toll booth

 Corporate violence, we can't abide 
  
 Mike D:

 Bagel from Bob and a TV Dinner 
 I'm the one that won that dance contest 
 Cause you know I dance the best 
 All you gotta do is do your thing, you see 
 Cause I don't give a fuck who you're supposed to be 
 My name is Adrock and I aim to please 
 And I gotta spread love in society 
  
 We gotta keep the party going on 
 All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms 
  
 What you saw what you heard 
 I get involved I might disturb 
 And if you want what's going down 
 You might just get that silky sound 
 So what'cha want? So what'cha need? 
 I've got the fonts you want to read 
 Get in the game you gotta scheme 
 All the same I've got the team 
 More new wave, not OG 
 Walking down the block you say "Yo, D! 
 When you coming out with the new CD 
 That spreads love in society?" 
  
 We gotta keep the party going on 
 All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms 
  
 Goto goto goto goto 
 Don't mess with crack or the baking soda 
 Whether in the high rise where you live like Rhoda 
 Or in the shack and you live like Yoda 
 Once again it's on like a brand new morn 
 Beatsie Beatsie Boys here to keep you all warm 
 All you spazzes and you freaks 
 Go and do your thing cause you're unique 
 If it don't hurt nobody else than 
 Don't be afraid to be yourself and 
 Special dedication and so on 
 To all lifestyles, sizes, shapes and forms 
 We gotta keep the party going on 
 All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms 
  
 "Tappin', clappin, rappin', the sound of fingers snappin’ 
 Tappin', snappin', knockin', rappin', a little sound growin' 
 Coming out 'n' going all the time""Well Toby, still want to be bionic?" 
 "You bet! I saw the way you mopped up those guys. If I could do that there wouldn't be a kid in town that could make me..." 
 "Toby, listen to me. What you saw in there was a man being forced to go berzerk because there are parts of his body he wasn't born with" 
  
 Hearers of the tone with the sensitive poem

 With the Human Beatbox for the people's delight 
  
 I run the three-legged race in a potato sack 
 I put a whole potato salad right down your back 
 I get mad respect at the old folk's home 
 Your mama's grandpapa won't leave me alone

 You're like the Tidy Bowl man spinning down the drain 
 Cause I'm a cyborg created to emcee 
 We're gonna change our name to The Disco Three

 Bionic eye with the do-do-do-do-do-do.... 
  
 I got my gear on like the Ear-ons 
 The human switchboard and interferons 
 We Jam On It like Newcleus 
 I'm known on a roll like Caduceus 
  
 Do androids dream of electric sheep? 
 Well, either way you're going to sow just what you reap 
 Cause I'm a replicant, not a skin-job 
 Yo, HAL, open the fuckin' doors to the pod 
  
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
  
 Ah! Ah! 
 (Human Beatbox sample) 
  
 Smooth like butter, pure like ghee 
 Let me get up on the mic with the do-re-me 
 My dog's name is Sam, not Fifi 
 I'm profilin' a boulangerie 
  
 Robotron, Gorf, and Galaga 
 I got the sexy Dig Dug calendar 
 Mix Master's scratching like he's got lice 
 The crabs! Hey yo, that ain't nice! 
  
 Like One-Eyed Jacks and Suicide Kings 
 You want wildness, wild I bring 
 My Uncle Freddie's making horseradish 
 To serve you on a platter like gefilte fish 
  
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
 Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em 
  
 "Well Toby, still want to be bionic?" 
 "What do you think you're doing in here you little agh..."(Instrumental)InstrumentalYea... 
 You're coming off like you're van Damme 
 You've got Kenny G, in your Trans Am 
 You've got names like Billy Ray 
 Now you sing Hip Hop Hooray 
 Put your Oakleys and your stone wash on 
 Watching MTV and you mosh on 
 #1 on the side and don't touch the back 
 #6 on the top and don't cut it wack, Jack 
  
 Mullet head 
  
 Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back 
 Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back 
 Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back 
 Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back 
  
 Shiny chrome rims, never rusted 
 Driving through the tunnel, you might get busted 
 Never trusted, Mullet head 
 You know you took that girl to bed 
 Cruising 8th Street, Saturday night 
 Trying to find a head shop, looking to fight 
 You've got that stonewash derriere 
 Spike the top because the weekend is here 
  
 You wanna know what's a mullet? well 
 I got a little story to tell 
 About a hair style, that's way of life 
 Have you ever seen a Mullet wife? 
  
 Yo, take a chill, B, check out my Spillbee 
 Cause you don't know about the Mullet head 
 Cruise in my IROC, stonewash on my cock 
 Got it like that cause I'm the Mullet head 
 Put me on trial cause I'm worth your while 
 Pass me the comb cause I'm the Mullet man 
  
 Got the New York Post, read a story 
 About Joey Buttafuoco in all his glory 
 They said he tried to freak it with a high school girl 
 Pimpin' Amy Fisher to the rest of the world 
 A real lover man, a real Casanova 
 Joey got horny and now he's over 
 Amy got pissed, shot his wife 
 Joey goes to jail for the rest of his life 
  
 Cut the sides, and don't touch the back 
 The back, the back...Rickity-rickity-rickity-rickity-wow! 
 I got the golden style 
 You people go wild when I bless this crowd 
 Ooh to the ahh, to the ooh to the eee 
 You want to know who funky and I said 'Je suis' 
  
 Well, I give you a wedgie, I give you a noogie 
 Put my foot up your ass, electric boogie 
 Break dancing at your door on a pile of shit 
 Set the bag on fire for the fuck of it 
  
 I bust into your radio station, chuck a smoke bomb 
 Put on my gas mask and put my tape on 
 By the time you figure out what went wrong 
 Light up my jet pack and I'm gone 
  
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
  
 I grab my mic and people lose their minds 
 And twist their hands in the air and bop their heads in time 
 Rockin', shoutin' (do your dance, Mike) 
 Because I'm built for speed like a Tour de France bike 
  
 I got the tape spinnin' in the echoplex 
 I keep the competition sealed under a hex 
 And if you waste my time then I get vexed 
 I'm eatin' MCs up by the dozen for breakfast 
  
 Like Franz Harary, I'm a magic man 
 Films in the can, cat's in the bag, carpet is shag 
 You can try to take the boast, but you can't take the brag 
  
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
  
 We come together upon the mic and rock it 
 We got styles ain't none of y'all can top it 
 We in the cut and, yes, we in the pocket 
 We're getting down and that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right... 
  
 Yo, because I'm down in the basement mixin' up ink 
 I'm on the edge and I'm on the brink 
 You've got the press, and I've got the plates 
 We pressin' twenties by the crate 
  
 Yes, we make it happen with the rappin' 
 With the crunch with the Cap'n and the Boo Berry 
 With Count Chocula, the sound that you love 
 We've been getting fly with the highest above 
  
 I'm on, the one, the battle tank in Tron 
 You're too far gone -- ARGH! -- another pawn 
 Guide searching, what channel is he on? 
 Cause there ain't no sunshine when Mike D's gone 
  
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon 
 Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon... 
  
 Yo, the sound man almost lost his soup on that one 
 He's still contemplating it though 
 Oh-oh, look out!*Instrumental*[Verse 1] 
 I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros 
 I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know 
 But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise 
 To the interconnectedness that underlies 
 The lies upon lies have lost their meaning 
 The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being 
 Over and over, I fall, I learned to walk from a crawl 
 It's not sad, it's just the way and the purpose of it all 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt 
 Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt 
 I steal feels from reels, but I pay my respects 
 Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects 
 Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine 
 Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings 
 I give in and I win, I try to never complain 
 Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage 
 But I'll remain sane, making gain without pain 
 Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain 
 And keep it positive as painstaking as it is 
 I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live 
 I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live 
 I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So like a cloud carries rain, I'm gonna carry my rhyme 
 Coming like thunder with lightening timing 
 No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans 
 Ferment time like wine, no ploys or scams 
 Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas 
 Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas 
 Woke up this morning right out of a dream 
 Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme 
 What can I do with these bones and flesh? 
 With these animated thoughts in a world repressed? 
 I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change 
 I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range 
 I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros 
 I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose 
 I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey, and King 
 His Holiness and all enlightened beings 
 I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone 
 I'll be the one who brings it inside your home 
 But the words ain't mine, I just pass 'em along 
 For Betty Williams and her friends, I sing this song 
 And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes 
 And more crimes are committed as I say these lines 
  
 Youth enough, we put down the gunI want to take this minute to introduce you to my people 
  
 This one is for Sao Paulo 
 This one's for Baytown 
 To Sac-Town, the whole Bay Area and all galaxies 
 Bangkok 
 This goes out to, to Albee Square Mall 
 This one's for Ondo 
 Bombay 
 Espania 
 Upper Tasmania 
 Scandinavia 
 To all the people in the Dead Sea 
 This one's for Newcastle, where Venom come from 
 Kyoto 
 This one's for Gloucester, Massachusetts 
 New Delhi 
 Italia 
 Beijing 
 The Takei Brothers 
 Cairo 
 Miami 
 Xenon 
 14th StreetWho got the chance to make things right? 
 Why the politicians always want to fight? 
 The Christian Coalition and the right wing ooooh! 
 Let me tell you what you can do 
 Step outside the cone of silence 
 Too much hatred and violence 
 It's time to rewind 
 We need a military decline 
 Got the power of the mind focused 
 Government like a locust 
 Are we gone or just going? 
 Time to act on what we be knowing y'all 
  
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 Who got the power to make a change? 
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 We got the 
 We got the 
 We got the 
  
 Eyes on the prize and never wane 
 Take the bull by the reins 
 If you want it be the change 
 Like Gandhi and MLK 
 Wait up, got to change the system 
 Need knowledge, power and wisdom 
 Same way I rock this microphone 
 Speak up, just let it be known 
 Hey ladies, fellas 
 And everyone between 
 Take the power back, let them react 
 And let's show them what we mean; Check it out 
  
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 Who got the power to make a change? 
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 We got the 
 We got the 
 We got the 
  
 We can work, walk, march and protest 
 Think about how we approach this 
 Ask questions but they keep frontin' 
 Due time we change a little something 
 Hey yo don't you know 
 Won't forget Amadou Diallo 
 To the crooked people and the crooked cops 
 Got to spread love before the world goes pop 
 Never again should we use the A-bomb 
 We need an international ban on 
 All WOMDs gone 
 We need a multilateral disarm 
  
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 Who got the power to make a change? 
 Who got the power to make a difference? 
 We got the 
 We got the 
 We got the 
  
 And power is the thingTo the, to the, to the people up top! 
  
 [Verse 1: Mike D] 
 Bam! God damn! 
 Holy mackerel, pulling suckers' cards out the satchel 
 You can sleep tonight, it's OK 
 B Boys in the cut and we're here to stay 
  
 [Verse 2: MCA] 
 Vibration, sensation 
 Chatter up on the mic and it's an incantation 
 Revelation, elation 
 A little patience with the tribulations 
  
 [Verse 3: Ad-Rock] 
 Heed my flow, I got more in store 
 Rhymes are not just for breakfast any more 
 Always on vacation, like Clark and Rusty 
 Don't wanna make the beer fest, trust me 
  
 [Hook] 
 Boys in the cut, cu-cut 
 And we here, here, here to stay 
  
 [Verse 4: MCA] 
 Your wack style is beyond a pale 
 Heel up, wheel up, to the one Judge Smails 
 Come at me with rain, I'm coming back with hail 
 My broad sword will cut through your chain mail 
  
 Back up, Mike 
  
 [Verse 5: Mike D] 
 Well, Ad-Rock, one of the greatest of all time, no disrespect 
 I gotta go for mine 
 Big Mike D, up here spitting lead paint 
 Bringing it back, begin da oh-ah-oh-ah 
  
 [Verse 6: Ad-Rock] 
 A-D-R-O-C-K spells relief 
 There's holes in my story like Leon Spinks' teeth 
 Good grief, the middle name's Keefe 
 I keep a microphone in a little, weird sheath 
  
 [Hook] 
 Boys in the cut, cu-cut 
 And we here, here, here to stay 
  
 [Verse 7: Mike D] 
 I'm like Oscar the Grouch, trashy 
 Rockin' Derelicte, flashy 
 I keep it raw y'all 
 Just imagine the 42nd Street C train bathroom 
  
 [Verse 8: MCA] 
 I sizzle on the mic like a battered fried fish 
 Pundits in the house say -- WHOOP! -- that's rich! 
 This is the type of shit that's gonna scratch that itch 
 Now I'm-a set it off from up inside this bitch 
  
 [Verse 9: Mike D] 
 I see you're looking at me and thinking 'What him do?' 
 Well, I rap upon this mic, Mike D, Sweet Lou 
 Also known as Pretty Lou, a-k-a Pretty Mike 
 I switch up my name pretty much how I like 
  
  
 This routine dates way back 
 A lot of people may remember this routine 
 But it's evolved now 
 Yeah, from the summer before last 
  
 [Outro: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA] 
 Well, my name is Mike D, and I gotta new name, and that new name is LARRY! 
 Well, my name is Ad-Rock, and then I gotta new name, and my new name is HARRY! 
 Well, my name is MCA, but I gotta new name, and that new name is GARY! 
 Well, our DJ's name has stayed the same, cause his new name is BARRY![Phone dials 411] 
  
 The shit with this bitch 
 Yo I said I'm calling you B 
 Yo B it's the phone 
 Yo B 
  
 "May I help you?" 
 "Yes what's your name?" 
 "Hello?"

 "Here's my supervisor, he'll help you" 
 "Yo man, where's the supervisor at?

 These pussy crumbs are making me itch! 
 Ah Cookie Puss, HEY! Ah Cookie Puss

 "Yo, yo, yo!"

 "Take me home and eat me, yeah!"

 "Hello, Carvel?" 
  
 "Yo man Cookie Puss there?" 
 "Who?" 
 "Cookie Puss, I want to speak to Cookie Puss man!"

 "Beastie Boys rock!" 
 "Beastie Boys"Well, I'm intergalactic, planetary 
 Planetary, intergalactic 
  
 Well the spice is the worm and the worm is the spice 
 I'll battle any alien when I'm on the mic 
 Like the Great Gazoo when I'm on the one 
 I phase motherfuckers when my mic's on stun 
 Satellite dish, spaceship communications 
 Gravity bonin', space fornication (yeah) 
 I'm getting stupider, when I'm on Jupiter 
 On Uranus, and that's just heinous 
 And my name is Mike D and 
 The first man on the moon with the three wood teeing 
 I was suspended in animation just the other day 
 Well I was in the night kitchen on the Milky Way 
 Because I'm getting funky with dilithium crystals 
 Lieutenant Uhura! *this is Kissel* 
  
 Warning! Warning! 
 We have intruders on sector G-7, level 9. Warning! 
  
 Now I'mma break it down with the Dr. Spock shit 
 Pinch ya buck naked leave ya in the cockpit 
 I'm like the cover of Jimmy Smith's 'Stay Loose' 
 Well I be breakin' in space in my gravity shoes 
 I got tickets to Interzone, so won'tcha beam me up 
 Hurricane's in orbit with *the scratchin' cuts* 
 I do-doodle on the paper like my name was scheme 
 Your galaxy is my bombin' theme 
 Well I'm worth your while, while you're while I'm worth 
 *Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth* 
  
 I fall like Shawn Kemp from the Supersonics 
 I got the coded double kick with the phat catonics 
 I'll be in the crator and you know I slapped it 
  
 Planetary, intergalactic 
  
 Battlestar one, in G-Son 
 We're gonna rock the universe for everyone 
 We're gonna rock the universe for everyone 
 We're gonna rock the universe for everyone 
 We're gonna rock the universe for everyone 
  
 So Mario, rock the universe 
 So Hurricane, rock the universe

 We began, to attack 
 The eggs did crack on Mojo's back 
 Go!!! 
  
 Egg raid on Mojo

 Egg raid on Mojo 
 Egg raid on Mojo 
  
 Gonna scream, gonna fight 
 We'll have an egg raid tonight 
 Gonna scream, gonna fight 
 We'll have an egg raid tonight!!!!! 
  
 [Outro] 
 Egg raid, gonna die 
 Beat up Mojo, all the time[Intro] 
 "Ready? One... You will do this four times with the left 
 Four with the right, then eight times with both 
 Then repeat" Ah... Clap your hands... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now, let me get some action from the back section 
 We need body rockin' not perfection 
 Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc 
 And let your spine unwind — just take a risk 
 I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn 
 Tell me party people, is that so wrong? 
 The ship is docking, interlockin' 
 And up-rockin', electro-shocking 
 We're getting down, computer action 
 Do the robotic satisfaction 
 Now all of y'all, get off the wall 
 Have a ball and get involved with 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Flame on, I'm gone 
 I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon 
 Came out rapping when I was born 
 Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn 
 Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion 
 Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion 
 The sound of the music makin' you insane 
 You can't explain to people this type of mind frame 
 Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape 
 I'm fine like wine when I start to rap 
 We need body-rockin', not perfection 
 Let me get some action from the back section 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Mike D, with the master plan 
 I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am 
 And when I grab the mic, you scream, "Ooh, goddamn" 
 The crème de la crème is who I am 
 MCA, where have you been? 
 Packed like sardines in the tin 
 So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins 
 'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim 
 And Adrock, light up the place 
 And if you pull my card, you pull the ace 
 And if you ask me, turn up the bass 
 And if you play defender 
 I could be your hyperspace... So 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin' 
  
 [Outro] 
 "You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right 
 Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each 
 Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet 
 Left foot... Ready? It's one two three four five"[Instrumental]Now don't start a fessin', you'll all have a chance 
 We're so damn hard, we never slip 
 Gonna rock, gonna roll, we'll take control 
 But if ya' had to rock the mic, it's in the soul 
 In the heart, in the mind, it'll make you blind 
 It'll make the other rappers a drop for a dime 
 Do you mind, huh, it can take you home 
 And teach you not to fess on the microphone 
  
 [MCA] 
 M-A-Z-I-N-G 
 I'm a messing on the mic at all the cool parties 
 I've been on the mic in Rome and Capri 
 And all the fine Italian women fell in love with me 
 Now Mike D's stroll, stealin' the show 
 I say, come on Mike D, let's flash some dough 
 On the go all of the time 
 When you're rappin' your rhyme, you know you ring my chime 
 And now he's the one who's gonna show you how to dance 
 The King Adrock don't give him a chance 
 When he starts to dance, the ladies gather around 
 The King Adrock, he's gonna get down 
 He'll bust the know how to do it to you 
 Just four fresh folks and we form a fresh crew 
 Adrock just make that move 
 Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove 
 I say K-I-N-G A-D rock 
 You know the whole world is on my jock 
 I got girls after me on the T-I-P 
 And I will do it to you, and you know it's you I please 
 Cause I'm a man who needs no introduction 
 Got a big tool of reproduction 
 Bouncin' in your ears what you always wishin' 
 For the day to come when I start to dishin' 
 On your body and your mind 
 Just take number and get in line 
 Cause when I get you into bed, you know I'll soothe you 
 Then you'll know the real meaning of the Beastie groove 
 And now something new, a double-time cool rhyme 
 From my boy Adrock sendin' tickles up your spine 
 Suck on this, cause he rocks gritty 
 A B-E-A-S-T-I-E, well, everyone knows me 
 You know that I can surely be the number one in frequency 
 I'm hip, I'm hoppin', I tick and tock 
 For everyone that's on my jock 
 You know that I can surely rock 
 I like to talk, I take the time 
 Turn it in, I turn it out 
 Makin' rhymes, scream and shout 
 King of the mic, I rock 
 I know how to turn you on just like a light 
 I'm number one and I'm the one 
 King Adrock of physico to the last 
 Is the day of the Beastie groove 
 So bet the fly rhymes to make you move 
 Everybody in the world, who ever you are 
 You better get ready, DJ Double R, huh 
  
 That's right 
 Hey, hey, mama 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Just make that move 
 Just rock to the ryhthm of the Beastie groove 
 Well, I'll put it to you, I'm Mike D 
 I'm rappin' on the mic, a number one MC 
 Cause when I'm on the court, I put the ball in the hoop 
 I'll throw you ten bucks as I do the alley-oop 
 Just throw me the ball, and watch me get down 
 I'll take you for a sucker, and I'll throw you to the ground 
 Take that, if you think you can 
 Meet the floor and that to this here rap 
 Now you know you can bust that move 
 Everybody dance to the Beastie groove 
  
 [MCA] 
 Just make that move 
 Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove 
 Come on gorgeous, pretty, little, French fly girlie 
 See me standin' on the stage and wanna' tour around the world 
 If you wanna' see some more when I'm not on the floor 
 Just come on back stage and I'll tell you how to turn it 
 You don't know what to do, I'll do it to you 
 Well, just take off your clothes and start the boogaloo 
 Now all the nice ladies, well I'll say please 
 Please 
 And they all know that's me 
 MCA makin' the party 
 With the ultimate rhymes from tip to bass 
 Just doin' those ladies all over the place 
 On the floor or in the back, I never do it wack 
 Just put 'em in a line, layin' on their back 
 And then I'll do them all, one at a time 
 MCA so loose with the rhyme 
 Ohh 
 The BEASTIE GROOVEDear Alex and Marilyn 
 They're Lovey and Thurston howellin 
 The grasshopper unit is prowellin 
 And Rufus is back home growellin 
 For all of y'all that are dozin 
 On Hornblower's lederhosen 
 Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen 
 And then the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in 
 Cause when he's out in space carousin 
 Pick up my mic and start joustin 
 His name plate medallion 
 Says never trust a hal 9000 
  
 Check the horizontal hold and check the tint 
 Are these three fools back at it again 
 Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint 
 Nothin but sparks ignitin' 
 Check two one two mic testin 
 This one goes out to Dechen 
 Rise fallen fighters take your stance again 
 Don't think too much about the color of skin 
 Order in vegetarian sharks fin 
 Try to keep my life non violent 
 Rewind the tape and punch me in 
 Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in 
  
 I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep movin' 
  
 Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it 
 Ooh my my something's really wrong 
 The p.a. sound is deafenin 
 Bitin MCs I'm oustinin 
 With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin 
 So on your way out please take a mint 
 Got the studio to throw a craze in 
 The basslines Yauch just lays in 
 This song is the grass you're grazin 
 Add a little flange and phase in 
 Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin 
 I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin 
 They're gonna put me in the b.i.n 
 And if I die notify the next of kin 
  
 It's like that y'allElectrify, ele-electrify, electrify 
 Electrify, ele-electrify, electrify 
 Electrify, ele-electrify 
  
 Words coming forth like water from the tap 
 Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack 
 Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane 
 I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games 
 People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound 
 But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found 
 It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle 
 It's just the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles 
 Scandelescent in the means, I have dreamed on the schemes 
 Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes 
 So can I get a witness to testify? 
 Open your eyes, realize, electrify 
  
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
  
 So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes 
 It's times like these, I'll just go with the decisions of the masses 
 And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways 
 To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today 
 With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong 
 Whilst all around me, those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs 
 It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed 
 A set back ain't all that much problem to invade 
 So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night 
 I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight 
 But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames 
 Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed 
 Can I get a witness to testify? 
 Open your eyes, realize, electrify 
  
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify 
 Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify[Hook] 
 In a world gone mad it's hard to think right 
 So much violence hate and spite 
 Murder going on all day and night 
 Due time we fight the non-violent fight 
  
 Mirrors, smokescreens and lies 
 It's not the politicians but their actions I despise 
 You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day 
 With the cocaine and Courvoisier 
 But you build more bombs as you get more bold 
 As your mid-life crisis war unfolds 
 All you want to do is take control 
 Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold 
 Citizen rule number 2080 
 Politicians are shady 
 So people watch your back cause I think they smoke crack 
 I don't doubt it look at how they act 
  
 [Hook] 
 In a world gone mad it's hard to think right 
 So much violence hate and spite 
 Murder going on all day and night 
 Due time we fight the non-violent fight 
  
 First the 'War On Terror’, now war on Iraq 
 We're reaching a point where we can't turn back 
 Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs 
 And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon 
 Well I'll be sleeping on your speeches 'til I start to snore 
 Cause I won't carry guns for an oil war 
 As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam 
 Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam 
 Now don't get us wrong cause we love America 
 But that's no reason to get hysterica 
 They're layin' on the syrup thick 
 We ain't waffles we ain't havin' it 
  
 [Hook] 
 In a world gone mad it's hard to think right 
 So much violence hate and spite 
 Murder going on all day and night 
 Due time we fight the non-violent fight 
  
 Now how many people must get killed? 
 For oil families pockets to get filled? 
 How many oil families get killed? 
 Not a damn one so what's the deal? 
  
 It's time to lead the way and de-escalate 
 Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate 
 Say ooh ah what's the White House doin'? 
 Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing??!!!!???!! 
 Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam 
 We need these fools to remain calm 
 George Bush you're looking like Zoolander 
 Trying to play tough for the camera 
 What am I on crazy pills? We've got to stop it 
 Get your hand out my grandma's pocket 
 We need health care more than going to war 
 You think it's democracy they're fighting for? 
  
 [Hook] 
 In a world gone mad it's hard to think right 
 So much violence hate and spite 
 Murder going on all day and night 
 Due time we fight the non-violent fightPow!Hey ladies, break dance

 Yes I love life and I try not to doubt it 
 Yes I'm gonna party cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it

 Sweet like a nut filled with Nutella 
 Creamy like buffalo mozzarella 
 Sneaking around you know I smell ya 
 Well I play ya like a peanut and throw the shell ya

 Middle school rapper and a proud yes y'aller 
 If ya think about your grandma go ahead call her 
 From the East Coast so I don't say hella 
 At the mic stand my performance is stellar 
 Pop the tape in and I listen to fella 
 I give a little shout to Nelson Mandela 
  
 NOW get busy 
  
 Known for the words that make you scream and holler 
 I'm Count Dooku to your Queen Amidala 
 Give a shout to Spiro or John Waller 
 I'm a student of the game and a bona fide scholar 
 So ease up on the bong to ease that coughin' 
 Butter's on the table now watch it soften 
 Bring in those beats and I'm a bring them often 
 I'm a keep rappin' when I'm in my coffin 
 Like a mind gone mad that is unwinding 
 In a padded room the walls you're climbing 
 Don't sign on the line if it looks binding 
 Ya have to get loose and find the lining 
  
 NOW get busyOne, two, three, four...Ok, good evening everybody 
 Everybody uh ready?

 A little story about someone that was very special to me 
 And this is a special song about that special someone 
 About just how special things can be, you know 
 I'm sure everybody out there has gone 
 Uh, felt, felt something very similar to that 
 And it can, uh, it can be the best thing

 It can make you feel great or

 You know, I saw you all alone 
 I was on the boardwalk, you know 
 You know, you were looking lovely 
 A little bit lonely and uh 
 You know, you was squirting the water in the clown's mouth and everything 
 But, hey baby, you know I would win the whole prize for you 
 The whole nine yards, the, the skee ball tickets 
 Everything baby for youSomething on the windowsill 
 Caught her eye and held her still 
 The cars pass by outside 
 Nowhere left to hide 
 Picture this now crystal clear 
 Nothing left to hold her here 
 And creeping up meanwhile 
 Traces of a smile 
  
 Something on the windowsill 
 Caught her eye and held her still 
 The cars pass by outside... 
 Eyes open wide to see if I could fly... 
  
 Something on the windowsill... 
 Something on the windowsill...Thank you very much 
  
 I'm hyp-no-tized.. by you 
 I'm hyp-no-tized.. by you 
 By you, by you, by you, by you 
  
 By you... 
 By you...It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
  
 Like Frankenstein or Count Dracula 
 I grab the mic and then I fuck it up 
 I never settle for less and that's a fact 
 I'm lettin' you know we not the wack wack 
 Been nice and all that, c'mon and I'm a keep goin' yup 
 Bound to make money off the shit that I'm growing 
 Like that y'all and you don't quit 
 Keep it on y'all rock the sure shit 
 I put the pen to the paper and I went off 
 I'm dropping knowledge and wisdom like a mad head dog 
 Step into the function cause I'm representing 
 Lyrics on the brain and they sit fermenting 
 I try to go and learn the give and the go 
 Free up my mind let loose with the lyric flow 
 Trying to get Frank get back, get back, right 
 Trying to stay positive and feeling alright 
  
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
  
 "Keep goin' on and on and on and on and on" 
  
 So pass the pen and then pass the pad 
 Like DJ Run there was nothin' ever like the 
 The sex rhyme kid is back in the panic 
 Gonna drop the ball on my damn mechanic whoo 
 Fuckin' up my Nova, naw fuckin' up my life, shit 
 Fuckin' with my world, cause he's fuckin' with the pipe, aw damn 
 Like the saying goes, you gotta call and duke it off 
 Ask Juanito, he'll tell you all about it 
  
 Gettin' blind in the mind, two hits and a cough 
 Put my pager on vibrate, and jerk myself off 
 Weight on my shoulders and now I'm stressin' 
 Gotta get back and count my blessings 
 Stuck on my cellular, I can't get off 
 This ride is in motion and I can't get let off 
 Get my penis double clepped and my balls rotated (what?).. 
 Realized I was trying to get my brain notated 
  
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quit 
 It's like that y'all and ya don't quitIs the cup half empty? 
 Or is the cup half full? 
 Does the sun rise at dawn? 
 Or does the earth just spin along? 
 Or is it all perspective? 
 On how we see the world? 
 How many countless life forms 
 Are on a little ball that twirls? 
  
 Are we instrinsically separate beings? 
 Or could we possibly be parts of the same thing? 
 Water feeds the plants and 
 The sunshine make them grow 
 So how can anyone be an island on their own? 
  
 Does life life make me happy? 
 Or does it bring me down? 
 Do I have what I need? 
 Or do I just want what's around? 
 Am am I I seeing truth? 
 Or do I just see wool? 
 Well is the cup cup half half empty? 
 Or is the cup half full?[Intro]

 Now it's suffice to say that I'm nicer 
 Nice in the cut and, yes, I'm the slicer 
 Or should I say I'm the filleter 
 I hate the game, I hate the player 
 But don't get discombobulated and upset 
 Because trust me, we ain't even begun yet 
  
 Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 And you don't stop, the body rock

 As I flip your omelet at the b bizzle 
 I'm like Molto Mario, they call me Tasty D 
 Your quick fire challenge, freak the hijiki 
 You can call me chef cause it's bonafide 
 Knife skills on the block that I'm taking worldwide 
  
 Mike D got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 Adrock got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 MCA got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 And then you don't stop, the body rock 
  
 I've got bass lines bubbling up on out of my hands 
 Don't want to never play nothin' that sounds too bland 
 Shazam! I sprinkle on some magic dust 
 You've got a bagel in your pants and that's a must 
 Plus I cuss and I grab my nuts 
 Got a six finger ring that says "excuse our dust" 
  
 Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop 
 And you don't stop, the body rock 
  
 Sometimes things just don't connect(Instrumental)Well, I'm chilly-chill most of the time 
 But I make a lot of noise when I bust a fresh rhyme 
 I'm cooling with the posse, cold drinking pissy 
 Met a young girl and got cold busy 
  
 Not Abbott and Costello, just me and my mellow 
 Got a microphone so I don't gotta bellow (yeah) 
 I'm tough not yellow, I don't eat Jello 
 I know that I'm def, what about this fellow (tell 'em) 
  
 I'm Mike D, I'm known fly cooly (tell 'em) 
 Got the fly rhymes and the fresh fly woolie 
 Starting epidemic each and every time (time) 
 Girls cutting class to hear me rhyme 
  
 Stand at the bar, don't sit on a stool 
 Ride a Harley, not a goddamn mule 
 Well...kick it! 
 Me and my crew doing the do 
 Cooling around the way cause we got to 
 There's one more thing that you should know 
 Mike D is a desperado 
  
 Well, DJ Strong hold popping that weak 
 He punched Big Bird in his goddamn beak 
 Gold on my fingers, silver in my pocket 
 Mike went to the party and (D) tried to rock it 
 That party was weak, I did The Freak 
 I peeped out the back with the fresh unique 
 Got girls on my tippy back out the way (what?) 
 Jocking and clocking 
 I'm MCA (yeah)

 But I don't gotta worry cause I'm so damn cold 
 Kick it cold, cold rocking

 You know I'm goddamn stupid 
 Farther than any other record can go 
 Don't you know I'm rocking in stereo 
 I'm on the top, bottom, even in the middle 
 I got the def rhymes and it ain't no riddle 
 I'm the king of the castle with no hassle 
 Take a girlie to my house, we start to wrestle 
 Cause I'm a rebel without a pause (check it) (word) 
 Keep rocking and breaking laws 
 I got Gucci cologne so you know I'm not stinking 
 Got more rhymes than my boy Abe Lincoln 
 Get those suckers cause you know I gotta 
 Order a fajita and a fresh enchilada 
 Shot that parrot cause he used to chirp 
 Can't eat Chinese cause it makes me burp 
 Went from bar to bar, I got rejected 
 My fake ID, it was disrespected 
 Got records in London 
 Quit my job cause my boss is a faggot

 What you get (you get, you get) 
 Here's a little somethin for yaActin' like the last generation on earth 
 You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth 
 You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet 
 Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed 
 Well it's due time that we look and pay attention 
 As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us 
 Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth 
 I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth 
 In these great times we still neglect 
 When they invent this land, don't give the due respect 
 Cause the FBI and the CIA 
 The whole federal government, the FDA 
 Well, the system doesn’t work and it must be changed 
 And there's more people in the pen everyday 
 So I visualize resolution 
 Yo, everyday is in a state of evolution 
  
 Evolution time 
 Evolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revelation time 
 Revelation time 
 Resolution time 
 Resolution 
  
 We come a long way with the peace in the East 
 But on the home front, they're wild in the streets 
 As it gets got hear a changing in same 
 And this is the Millennium still felt today 
 I hear the same stories time after time 
 The stories of fear, through violent crimes 
 Committed by hatred by satient beings 
 Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see 
 Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer 
 If we stand together, there's nothing stronger 
 We must interconnect it as though we sure have won 
 If we want to avoid planetary destruction 
 So I work and I work because the hate in my mind 
 Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find 
 And I visualize resolution 
 See it all as a state of constant evolution 
  
 Evolution time 
 Evolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revelation time 
 Revelation time 
 Resolution time 
 Resolution 
  
 The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride 
 Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies 
 Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction 
 Sure as we boast they're at their last production 
 Threatening and challenging nature against nation 
 Walkin' down the road of total annihilation 
 Sprouting threats is insecure 
 Guns are for the fighting and they're immature 
 And it all stems from self-important police 
 Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings 
 So I wanna empower the limit I can 
 And pass it along so we can do pass the pan 
 Sometimes I sit and I watch my mind 
 Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind 
 And stop and visualize resolution 
 For everyday is in a state of evolution 
  
 Evolution time 
 Evolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revolution time 
 Revelation time 
 Revelation time 
 Resolution time

 Go!Brothers out there with sisters, peep it 
 Years and years you try to keep her a secret 
 Said she's your cousin that came for a visit 
 Your putting me on, is this true, now who is it? 
 Called your crib, got a clicking dial tone 
 You said it was the maid that hung up the phone 
 Caught her on the streets, so we took the risk 
 Guess what, we found out she was your sis 
 Now we're not Tom, Dick, Harry, or Roy 
 Let us crack the freak, because we're your boys 
 Tonight we're dropping by cause your parents left 
 The Beastie Boy gonna let you know 
  
 Your sister's def 
 Your sister's def 
  
 She's so hook, is she, how can it be? 
 Don't lie, she's not in your family 
 Cause if you didn't know, people spread the word 
 Your a square sucker whipped, yes, you're a nerd 
 To be down, there's one thing you'll discover 
 Your sister must be a plash Beastie lover 
 So don't get sick, she was our pick 
 I hope her tongue is long, we like to be licked 
 You'll see it's not hard, it's naughty nice 
 You gotta pay us dues, and she's the price 
 Don't start to think about the world's discuss 
 Your sister's gotta hang, and that's a must 
 It's plain and simple, it ain't no thing 
 She's real def, let us give her a ring 
 So we conclude, this is your best move 
 Welcome, the Beastie Boys approve 
 Your sister's def 
  
 This week we all will meet 
 Right now the party season will reach its peek 
 Juice all around town, we're on the guest lists 
 We'll bring three tricks, you bring your sis 
 Pay attention real close, we just begun 
 Trick number one is to grab her buns 
 We'll loose control, but we'll keep it clean 
 She better not wear a dress, wear the blue jeans 
 New or faded, we want 'em tight 
 Take the pockets off so we can grip it right 
 Stand in front, we wanna see what we like 
 If the room's too dark, you bring a flashlight 
 Two is do the do, for the whole crew 
 A dead giveaway cause we're giving her clues 
 She better be ready to play the wall 
 Cause it's all for one, and one for all 
 No matter who's first, let's start the show 
 There are no rules, go for what you know 
 We won't slack up, won't let her rest 
 Our pride is on the line, to see who's best 
 Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd 
 Convince your sis, put in a good word 
 Your sister's def 
  
 At last a neurotic feast 
 We're slaying your sister like a horny beast 
 So don't get mad, don't be upset 
 It's now her time to be a Beastie pet 
 As you can see most definitely 
 Is trick number three, pure fantasy 
 Now we're your friend, and you're her brother 
 But your sister's so def we might scheme on your mother 
 We can't ignore now that we saw 
 She's def so we wanna be your in-law 
 We're having fun, yo, we ain't done 
 The Beastie Boys has just begun 
  
 Because your sister's def 
 Your sister's def 
  
 Took a walk around the crack of dawn 
 I noticed her bedroom light was on 
 Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower 
 I crept to the window to see a little closer 
 Said to myself, I got it made 
 The window was open, so was the shade 
 Came in real neat, she was in heat 
 Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat 
 Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner 
 Beastie beef is now served for dinner 
 Your sister's def 
  
 Later on I came around the way 
 But sis MCA said he got some play 
 There had to be a reason for the news I learned 
 Time to get on it cause it's Mike D's turn 
 Nobody was home, I didn't see the car 
 She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar 
 We was chilling in the basement, drinking Red Wipple 
 After a while my head between pink nipples 
 Grabbing at your sis cause I can't resist 
 I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish 
 When I got through, next thing she knew 
 On her thighs was a Beastie tattoo 
 Your sister's def 
  
 That's it, Adrock is pissed 
 If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm taking her clit 
 You can bet if she gets wet 
 The King Adrock will make her sweat 
 I throw her down, then take her underwear 
 Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs 
 Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream 
 It's the Adrock inches, and you know what I mean 
 We had her in the week, your sister's cheap 
 The Beastie Boys just made a clean sweep 
 Your sister's def[Intro - Nas] 
 Mic check, mic check 
  
 [Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys) 
 One (one), two (two), three (three) 
 Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs 
 It goes three (three), two (two), one (one) 
 MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done 
 Like ladies and gents, attention 
 Nas in the house with Beastie Boys 
 We can turn it out 
 Perpetrators, we can point 'em out 
 So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out 
  
 [MCA] 
 Like a Nexus-6, comin' home to roost 
 Handheld 58 when it's time to get loose 
 Don't need the ear goggles, just put me through the speakers 
 Like a scientist with tubes and beakers 
 Have MCs over my house and fix 'em brunch 
 But you rappers? We goin' out, goin' dutch 
 So pass me the sword, I'll start swingin' 
 Just randomly chopping on a crazy ass mission 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie 
 Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie 
 Oh my God, just look at me 
 Grandpa been rappin' since '83 
 I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad 
 Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag 
 Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad 
 All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs 
  
 [Nas] 
 I have carte blanche, the vagabond 
 Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund 
 I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a 
 You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer 
 A slug peeler, you're not 
 Mafioso, no 
 You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner 
 I ain't tryin' to hear your racket 
 You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat 
 You wear that jacket 
  
 [Mike D] 
 How many rappers must get dissed 
 Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this 
 I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss 
 The real hip hop with which I persist 
 Like rum in mojitos 
 Bullets and banditos 
 Matzoh balls in soup 
 Jackets and troop 
 Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books 
 Nasty Nas, what's the word? 
 Count it off on the hook 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [MCA] 
 Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain 
 To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame 
 My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister 
 So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer 
 Too many rappers to shake a stick at 
 I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to 
 Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records 
 My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack 
  
 [Ad-Rock] 
 To all you crab rappers and hackers 
 And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda 
 I take the cake, I stole the mold 
 The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold 
 And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace? 
 Sniffin', buffin', huffin' 
 And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin 
 Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin' 
  
 [Nas] 
 I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway 
 Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day 
 I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay 
 And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this 
 By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers 
 I hear Russian blonde's the wettest 
 But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas 
 And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up? 
  
 [Mike D] 
 Mike D, the man of mystery 
 History in the makin', and now we're takin' 
 Titles, awards, and accolades 
 Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades 
 We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches 
 Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases 
 Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars 
 Go back in time, send a fax from my car 
  
 [Hook]Oh what you, what are you sayin' 
  
 All you Trekkie's and TV addicts 
 Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static 
 All you Klingon's in the fuckin' house 
 Grab your backstreet friend and get loud 
 Blowin' doors off hinges 
 I'll grab you with the pincher's 
 And no, I didn't retire 
 I'll snatch you up with the needle nose pliers 
 Like Mutual of Omaha got the ill boat 
 You've never seen before glidin' in the glades 
 And like Lorne Greene you know I get paid 
 Like Caprese and with the basil 
 Not goofy like Darren or Hazel 
 I'm a motherfuckin' 'Nick At Nite' with 
 Classics re-running that you know all right 
 Now remain calm no alarm 'cause my farm ain't fat 
 So what's up with that 
 I've got friends and family that I respect 
 When I think I'm too good they put me in check 
 So believe when I say, I'm no better than you 
 Except when I rap so I guess it ain't true 
 Like that y'all and you just don't stop 
 Guaranteed to make your body rock 
 Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out 
 What, wha-what, what, what's it all about 
 Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out 
 Said, Doc, what's the condition? 
 I'm a man that's on a mission 
 Said, Son, you'd better listen 
 Stuck in your ass is an electrician 
 Like a scientist 
 Mmm, when I'm applying this 
 Method of controlling my mind 
 Like Einstein and the rappin' Duke combined 
 Hey baby, bubba now what the deal 
 I didn't know you go for that mass appeal 
 Some call it salugi some hot potato 
 I stole your mic and you won't see it later 
 'Cause I work magic like a magician 
 I add up like a mathematician 
 I'm a bank cashier, engineer 
 I wear cotton but I don't wear sheer 
 Shazam and abracadabra 
 In the whip I'm gonna cruise past ya 
 Yo money, don't chump yourself 
 Put that shit back on the shelf 
 Light rays blazin' 
 You're out of phase and my crews amazin' 
 We're working on the record yo 
 So stay patient 
 Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out 
 What, wha-what, what, what's it all about 
 Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out 
 (Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out) 
 (Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out) 
 (Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out) 
 (Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out) 
 Now, I go by the name of the King Adrock 
 I don't wear a cup nor a jock 
 I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre 
 Like Miss Piggy, who moi 
 I am the one with the clientele 
 You say, Adrock, you rock so well 
 I've got class like pink champ ale 
 MCA grab the mic before the mic goes stale 
 Don't test me they can't arrest me 
 I'll fake right crossover and shoot lefty 
 You look upset, yo, calm down 
 You look like cable guy dunked off of your crown 
 I flow like smoke out a chimney 
 You never been me, you wanna rap 
 But what you're making ain't Hip Hop B 
 Now get your clothes right out the dryer 
 Put armor all up on your tire 
 Sport that fresh attire 
 Tonight we goin' out set the town on fire 
 Set the town ablaze gonna stun and amaze 
 Ready to throw a craze 
 Make your granny shake her head 
 And say, Those were the days 
 Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out 
 What, wha-what, what, what's it all about 
 Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out 
 Let's turn this motherfuckin' party outHahahahaa, you don't stop 
 You keep on and you don't stop 
 You can't front on that 
 To the S-K-B, you don't stop 
 Ha... whoo 
 Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris 
 You're eating crazy cheese like you'd think I'm from Paris 
 You know I get fly, you think I get high 
 You know that I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why 
 So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing 
 The reason that you're smiling or wilding so listen 
 In my head I just want to take 'em down 
 Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down 
 Let it flow like a mud slide 
 When I get on I like to ride and glide 
 I've got depth of perception in my text y'all 
 I get props at my mention 'cause I vex y'all 
 So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?) 
 When you're so funny with the money that you flaunt 
 I said where'd you get your information from huh? 
 You think that you can front when revelation comes? 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 Well they call me Mike D the ever loving man 
 I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah!) 
 You scream and you holler, about my Chevy Impala 
 But the sweat is getting wetter than the ring around your collar 
 But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping 
 Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping 
 Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall 
 Well i'll be calling out you people like a casting call 
 Oh well it's wacked when you're jacked in the back of a ride 
 With your know with your flow when you're out gettin' by 
 Believe me, what you see is what you get 
 And you see me, comin' off as you can bet 
 Well I think I'm losin' my mind, this time 
 This time I'm losin' my mind; that's right 
 I said I think I'm losin' my mind, this time 
 This time, I'm losing my mind (this time!) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 But little do you know about something that I talk about 
 I'm tired of driving it's due time that I walk about 
 But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise 
 I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize 
 Well I'm Dr. Spock I'm here to rock y'all 
 I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall 
 I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?) 
 I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?) 
 Suckers write me checks, and then they bounce 
 So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount 
 See I'm the long leaner victor the cleaner 
 I'm the illest motherf*cker from here to Gardena 
 Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce 
 You've got the rhyme and reason but no cause 
 So if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease 
 I've got news for you crews, you'll be suckin' like a leech! 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?) 
 I got the big brown boots 
 When you wanna get kicked like a rhyme 
 From the heart and the mind 
 There was a time when the blunt got licked 
 I take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen 
 No Visine just a little, Afro-Sheen 
 And a High Times magazine 
 I like to smoke y'all, but the pigs come sweating 
 They like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking 
 They can't have none of the number one sess-stash 
 So keep your hands off the hash 
 Don't act rash, cause if you move too fast 
 I'll pull out my gat and blast your sorry ass... 
 And you can kiss my ass, haha 
 That was the "M" to the "I" to the "K" to the "E" to the "D" y'all

 Shit...Rob and steal from the health food store 
 The ideas you shout that are so hardcore 
 Screaming at the phone man collecting the change 
 Ideas discovered then rearranged 
  
 I won't say that life's a bitch and then you die 
 Because I do my best to enjoy mine 
 You can't bring me down to a world of self-pity 
 Lots of ways to deal with it 
 Deal with it 
  
 You do unto others like they're pieces of shit 
 A righteous man who's flipping the script 
 There's plenty of room for everyone at the table 
 Check yourself before you check the label 
  
 I won't live life being mad holding a grudge 
 It's not my place - sitting back, playing judge 
 Not enough time to always stay mad 
 May as well be glad to Deal With It 
 Deal With ItI can't think straight 
  
 Take a look, look at me 
 What you get is what you see 
 Ride a bike, drive a car 
 Vegan Pie, cut a fart 
 On the bus, on the train 
 Tami D, on the brain 
 Can't explain, like The Who 
 Now it's time to do the do 
 I can't think straight 
  
 On my couch with a pen 
 Where's the phone, again, again 
 Can't control rhythm, rhyme 
 Naked beats on the mind 
  
 I am yes, you are no 
 I am yes, you are no 
 You are no, I am yes 
 I can't think straight

 The Lovely and Thurston howlin' 
 The grasshopper unit is prowlin' 
 And Rufus is back home growlin' 
  
 For all of y'all that be dozin' 
 On Hornblower's lederhosen 
 Like Walt Disney, he is frozen 
 And in the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in 
  
 'Cause when he's out in space carousin' 
 Pick up my mic and start joustin' 
 My name plate medallion 
 Says never trust a Hal 9000 
  
 Check the horizontal hold and check the tint 
 Are these three fools back at it again? 
 Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint 
 Nothin but sparks ignitin' 
  
 Check two one two mic testin' 
 This one goes out to Dechen 
 Rise fallen fighters take your stance again 
 Don't think too much about the color of skin 
  
 Order in vegetarian sharks fin 
 Try to keep my life non-violent 
 Mario, rewind the tape and punch me in 
 Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in 
  
 I'm a long way from where I've been 
 But I gotta keep movin', movin' on 
  
 Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it 
 Ooh my my something's really wrong

 Bitin MCs I'm oustinin' 
 With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin' 
 So on your way out please take a mint 
  
 Got the studio to throw a craze in 
 The basslines Yauch just lays in 
 This song is the grass you're grazin' 
 Just add a little flange and phase in 
  
 Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin' 
 I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin' 
 They're gonna put me in the b.i.n 
 And if I die notify the next of kin

 Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn 
 All your eggs then you you go up the river 
 Listen to the abstract that freaky nigga 
 Now, I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock 
 And I can't stop with the body rock 
 See I've got heart like John Starks, hitting mad sparks 
 Pass me the mic and I'll be rocking the whole park

 The rhymes that we bust on the topic on lust 
 And my moms is not butt 
 But fuck it, let me get down to the rhythm 
 Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism 
 Like John Holmes, the x-rated nigga 
 Listen to the shit 'cause I'm the ill figure 
 Nobody's getting any bigger than this 
 Get it together

 Phone is ringing, oh my God 
 Get it together 
 See what's happening 
 Ad rock down with the ione 
 Listen to the shit because both of them is boney 
 Got to do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie 
 Because she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni 
 So why all the fight and why all the fuss 
 Because I ain't got no dust 
 Yea, you know I'm getting silly 
 Got a grandma Hazel and a grandma Tilly 
 I've got a Grand Royalprez and I'm also a member 
 Born on the cusp in the month of November 
 I do the Patty Duke in case you don't remember 
 Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender 
 Well, I'm long gone, word is born 
 Don't need a mother fucking fool telling me right from wrong 
 I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard 
 But I shall drive the lane like I was Evan Bernhard 
 And I've working on my game because life is taxing 
 Got to get it together and see what's happening 
 Get it together 
 Get it together 
 Get it together 
 See what's happening 
 I go one two like my name was Biz Mark 
 But I had to do the shit just let me embark 
 On the lyric and the noun and the verb 
 Let me kick the shit off 'cause yo, I'm not the herb 
 Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare 
 Tho moog with the funk for your derriere 
 While we're on that topic, yes I'd like to mention 
 When it comes to boning I'm representing 
 Spacing, zoning, talkin' on the phone and 
 My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going 
 Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend 
 I've got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking 
 Well, I'm a funky skull and I'm a Scorpio 
 And when I get my flow I'm Dr on the go 
 So Q-Tip, what you on the mic for 
 Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme 
 And when M.C.S come in my face, I'm like mace 
 Because I back them off with the quills 
 Nigga 'cause I tell you, nigga 'cause I'll keep you under prills 
 Resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the Farmes Boulevard 
 But I'm from Manhattan M.C.A.'s from Brooklyn 
 Yea, M.C.A., your shit be cooking 
 Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat 
 So, yo tip, what's up with the boot on your feet 
 I've got the timbos on the toes and this is how it goes 
 Oh, one two, oh my God 
 One two, oh my God, I've got some shit 
 I've got the Kung Fu grip behind my green trap kit 
 Never, ever, ever smoking crack, never, ever, ever fucking wack 
 I eat the fuckin' pineapple now & laters 
 Listen to me now, don't listen to me later 
 Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real 
 But, yo technically I'm as hard as steel 
 Gonna get it together, watch it

 And what you give is what you get[Instrumental]{Yo Cory this is Al, you can kiss my ass 
 I ain't interested in you anyhow 
 I'm just interested in the B-boys, so fuck you my man} 
 Yeah! 
 Who is that? 
 Who is the man coming down your block? 
 It's me you see with the funk in my walk 
 'Cause I'm doin' just what I like to 
 Today is my day yeah, and I'm a get nice too 
 You gotta keep movin' and you can't say nothing 
 I'm a keep bouncin' and bumpin' and struttin' 
 One thing you ought to know 
 Well I am the maestro 
 Yeah you motherfuckers, I am all that 
 I see you lookin' at me sayin', how can he be so skinny and live so phat? 
 You know why? 'Cause I'm the maestro, yeah you know and I'm 
 You got that? 
 I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance 
 I'm Mike D and I'm known for romance 
 I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side 
 And I'm riding down the block like I'm on a water slide 
 'Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressing my luck 
 'Cause I got nothing to lose 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 See a player, I play, don't play to win, I play to show 
 Yeah, I'm the maestro! 
 Aw yeah, I need everybody's cooperation right about now 
 I'd like to find out whose favorite detective it is 
 Is it Mannix? (No!) 
 Barnaby Jones? (No!) 
 Somebody say Columbo (Yeah!) 
 Micky Mahoney? 
 Clancy Claranin? 
 Barnaby Jones? 
 I said that already 
 Yeah that's right ya'll, you know I got my own shit 
 See this ain't America's Most Wanted, this is America's Most Mackin' 
 That's right other people oughta call it mockin' 
 When I get on there is no stoppin' 
 Who is that? 
 Who is the man? Who is the man? Who is the man? 
 (The maestro) 
 Three cheers for the maestro(Instrumental)Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book? 
 Look give it back, you're wicky wack 
 With your ticky tack calls, didn't touch you at all 
 I didn't touch your hand man, you know its all ball 
 You sold a few records, but don't get slick 
 'Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits 
 You've been in the game, your career is long 
 But when you break it down, you've only got two songs 
 MC's are like clay pigeons and I'm shootin' skeet 
 I just yell pull and MMM drops the beat 
 You people call yourselves MC's, but you're garbage men 
 Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen 
 And if you don't like then hey fuck you! 
 Come on in, now I read about you up on page six 
 They was trashin' your ass, it's sad you're getting dissed 
 Now talk about your face, now don't get pissed 
 But I suggest you see a dermatologist 
 I keep that hot sauce hot, not mild and weak 
 It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak 
 I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex 
 'Cause I've got more rhymes, than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks 
 Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch 
 You're hearing me and you're like "Oh my god its Sasquatch!" 
 I'm walkin' on water, while you're stepping in shit 
 So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit 
 And if you don't like then hey fuck you! 
 So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself 
 So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself 
 And if you don't like then hey fuck you! 
 Sucker MC's it's me they're resenting 
 In the animal kingdom they call it presenting 
 With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle 
 The truth is brutal your grandma's kugel 
 Kings County is my stomping ground 
 The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown 
 So don't ask me to wine and dine ya 
 I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina 
 You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam 
 You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am? 
 With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam 
 But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam 
 And if you don't like then hey fuck you! 
 And if you don't like then hey fuck you! 
 What a loser[Instrumental]Lyrics identical to "Stop That Train"Yeah baby.. 
 Ah yeah baby.. 
  
 Shit happens with the games you run 
 Never thought the day would come 
 It Ain't Tomorrow 'Till the day is done 
 A-Son you caught a bad one 
  
 Yeah son - changes we go through 
 Catch a bad one - think the world owes you 
 Yeah son - what do you owe me 
 You catch a bad one - c'mon son show me 
 Yeah Son - Till the day is done 
 Catch a bad one - time to pay attention 
 Yeah Son - All That's stress can equal none 
 A Son - you caught a bad one 
  
 Shit happens with the games you run 
 Even if it's a battle you won 
 The new day starts when today is done 
 A Son - you caught a bad one

 (InstrumentalMade a noise invented a sound 
 When Brian Wilson used it A hit was found 
  
 If only I could have imagined 
 The square waves running through his head 
  
 Square wave - people couldn't believe it 
 Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave 
  
 One rod for Pitch 
 Electro Magnetic Fields 
 Wired up Sing Sing 
 Hung out with Einstein 
  
 For all All of his brilliant innovation 
 Sent off to a siberian reservation 
 Square wave - people couldn't believe it 
 Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave 
  
 You catch a bad one 
  
 Shit happens with the games you run 
 Never thought the day would come 
 It Ain't Tomorrow 'Till the day is done 
 A-Son - you caught a bad one 
  
 Yea son - changes we go through 
 Catch a bad one - think the world owes you 
 Yea son - what do you owe me? 
 Catch a bad one, c'mon son show me 
 Yea Son - Till the day is done 
 Catch a bad one - time to pay attention 
 Yea Son - All That's stress can equal none 
 A Son - you caught a bad one 
  
 Shit happens with the games you run 
 Even if it's a battle you won 
 The new day starts when today is done 
 A Son - you caught a bad one 
  
 Yea son - what in the fuck the world owes you? 
 Catch a bad one - when nothing goes through 
 Yea son - All about the c.r.e.a.m 
 Catch a bad one - things are not as they seem 
 Yea Son - here your moms comes 
 A Son - you caught a bad oneInstrumental'Cos nobody can do it like Mix Master can, come on now 
 I've got the D double O, D double O style 
 Here we go again 'cos it's been awhile 
 Do me a favor don't touch that dial 
 I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile 
 My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice 
 I want to get next to you like Rose Royce 
 Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice 
 ''Cos when it's time to rhyme you know I get noice 
 Cruisin' like a fan boat on the glade 
 He'll tweak ass, your ass across the cross fade 
 So watch your back when he takes the stage 
 Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage 
 3 MC's and one DJ 
 And we be gettin' down with no delay 
 Mix Master Mike what cha got to say? 
 Sweet and sour like a tangerine 
 Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes 
 Kenny Rogers' Gambler is my gamblin' theme 
 Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine 
 Always updated and in the know 
 You know we break it down goin' toe to toe 
 The bass is boomin' from down below 
 And Norton is chillin' with Mario 
 And well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio 
 Don't ask me 'cos I just don't know 
 I'm known to mop and I'm known to glow 
 But don't get mad when we got to go 
 We just Three MC's and one DJ 
 And we be gettin' down with no delay 
 Mix Master Mike what cha got to say? 
 Mix Master, cut faster 
 Mix Master cut, cut, cut faster 
 This is all top secret and classified 
 I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide 
 It's all hypnotic and sanctified 
 So I never wanna let a bad day slip by 
 We be gettin' stupid in your area 
 We 'cosin' all kinds of hysteria 
 My beats is sick like malaria 
 But don't worry I'll take care of ya 
 Just me and Adam, Adam and Mario C 
 In the studio it's the place to be 
 To all beings everywhere be happy and free 
 With Mix Master Mike we're makin' history 
 We are just Three MC's and one DJ 
 And we be gettin' down with no delay 
 So Mix Master Mike what cha got to say?That's a record 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 So are we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Are you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So are we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Gonna break it all down 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 It's not a put down, I put my foot down 
 And then I make some love, I put my root down 
 I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance 
 Everybody know I'm known for dropping science 
 I'm electric like Dick Hyman 
 I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin' 
 Never let you down with the stereo sound 
 So mike, get on the mic and turn it out 
 We're talking root down, I put my root down 
 And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down 
 I said it's root down, it's time to scoot down 
 I know I'm step up to the mic in my goose down 
 Come up represent from the upper west 
 Money makin' put me to the test 
 Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed 
 'Cause I'm doing what I want so I never rest 
 Well I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys 
 Just strutting like the meters with the look-ka py py 
 'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born 
 But when the snow is falling then I'm gone 
 You do might think that I'm a fanatic 
 A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic 
 So kick it from the root when we break it on down 
 Jimmy Smith is my man I want to give him a pound 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 So are you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So are we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So are we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Break it all down 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Ad Rock, don't stop, just get on the mic with the tic and the toc 
 I'm gonna fill you with the fuckin' rim like brim 
 I'm walking down your block and you say that's him 
 There goes the guy with the funky sound 
 The Beastie Boys you know we come to get down 
 Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick and say 
 "Oh my God that's the funky shit" 
 So I'm a pass the mic and cause a panic 
 The original nasal kid is doing damage 
 Every morning took the train to high street station 
 Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation 
 On the way back up hearing battle tapes 
 Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes 
 It's like Harlem world battles on the Zulu beat show 
 It's kool moe D'vs busy bee there's one you should know 
 Enough of that just want to give some respect due M.C.A 
 Grab the mic and the ma bell connect you 
 Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight 
 If dancin' prays to the Lord then I will feel alright 
 I feel a good to play a little music 
 Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it 
 And no one can stop this flow from flowing on 
 A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone 
 I'll take a little shout out to my dad and mom 
 For bringing me into this world and so on 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 So are we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Are you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So are we gonna fuck it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Break it all down 
 Gonna kick it root down, down 
 [Incomprehensible] 
 And that's a record, that's a record [Incomprehensible] 
 And that's a record, that's a record [Incomprehensible] 
 And that's a record, that's a record [Incomprehensible] 
 Oh now that's a recordYou know that it will be untrue 
 You know that it will be a liar 
 La la la la la la la la... 
 Before we couldn't get much higher 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Try to set the night on, fire 
 The time of two is our own soul 
 No time to war in the mire 
 But darling we can only learn 
 While other people flail on fire 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Try to set the night on fire 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Come on baby light my fire 
 Try to set the night on fireInstrumental Beastie Joint (No Rap IQ™ to be had here...)It's hot here gotta say it's so 
 I got you right where I want 
 Got an honest face so you turn your back 
 When in doubt run up your attack 
  
 At one time you were slick and your grill was cold 
 And now funny how the shit gets old 
 You can run, you can run but it will catch up 
 Like now see me, I'll show you up 
  
 Now you wanna get back when you had your shine 
 But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme 
 Can't stop won't stop no compromise 
 It's a house of cards built out of lies 
  
 Coming down like a bird floating on the mist 
 Turn on the track back track and twist 
 You work hard to climb the list 
 Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift 
  
 I know the danger of a man (that's danger) 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
  
 You're caught now by the skin you're in 
 In a bind now your thoughts go to all your sins 
 Hits much harder back better count on that 
 I tell you what we know always holds us back 
  
 Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop 
 I got in your heart and I shook you up 
 In a bind now you're caught by the fear setting in 
 Choked on the thought that you don't it again 
  
 Keep the competition in check 
 You draft your plans at your drafting desk 
 You try to play to win but now you lost 
 Like clams with no tartar sauce 
  
 Wcheming in the attic, thought you had it 
 So dramatic 
 I got the stats mathematics, automatic-systematic 
 She's super bad now, whatcha watcha want now? 
  
 I know the danger of a man (that's danger) 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
  
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger) 
  
 I know the danger of a man (that's danger) 
 Who's been to hell and back again (danger) 
 Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger) 
 Don't play no game that I can't win (danger) 
  
 Don't play no game that I can't win 
 Don't play no game that I can't win[Instrumental]Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

 Well now, don't you tell me to smile 
 You stick around, I'll make it worth your while 
 Got numbers beyond what you can dial 
 Maybe it's because I'm so versatile 
  
 Style, profile, I said 
 It always brings me back, when I hear 'OOH child!' 
 From the Hudson River out to the Nile 
 I'll run the marathon to the very last mile 
  
 Well if you battle me, I will revile 
 People always say my style is wild 
 You've got gall, you've got guile 
 To step to me!? I'm a rapophile 
  
 If you want to battle, you're in denial 
 Coming from Uranus to check my style 
 Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial 
 Cast you off into exile

 Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene 
 When it comes to beats, well I'm a fiend 
 I like my sugar with coffee and cream 
  
 Well I got to keep it going, keep it going full steam 
 Too sweet to be sour, too nice to be mean 
 Well on the tough guy style- I'm not too keen 
 To try to change the world- I will plot and scheme 
  
 Mario C likes to keep it clean 
 Gonna shine like a sunbeam 
 Keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream 
 A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes

 Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine

 We're from the family tree of old school hip hop 
 Kick off your shoes and relax your socks 
 The rhymes will spread just like a pox 
 'Cause the music is live like an electric shock 
  
 I am known to do the Wop 
 Also known for the Flintstone Flop 
 Tammy D getting biz on the crop 
 Beastie Boys known to let the beat...mmm 'DROP'! 
  
 Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop 
 If my rap's soup, my beats is stock 
 Step from the table when I start to chop 
 I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock 
  
 If you try to knock me you'll get mocked 
 I'll stir fry you in my wok 
 Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop 
 Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

 Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall 
 Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat 
 Two hundred seventy five pounds, that you can't forget 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Spend all your money on your health insurance plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Keep on getting bigger, because you know that you can 
 Why do you force yourself on top of that girl? 
 Laugh with all your buddies, because it's a man's man's world 
 Someday that shit will come back to you 
 You've been throwing your weight around and your shit is through 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Going nowhere, got no master plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Heart attack 
 Weighs in at two seventy five 
 Yeh, my man is lucky to be alive 
 Smokin' and drinkin' too 
 My man, the heart attack man, is gonna be running over you 
 Got no God damn respect 
 Had to put the big big bitch ass in check 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Time to change your ways heart attack man 
 {What do we know about partying or anything else?}[Ad-Rock:] 
 Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser* 
 Back on the mic is the anti-depressor 
 Ad-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this 
 The best is yet to come, and yes, believe this 
 [Mike D:] 
 Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego 
 Step off my Seco, dressed up tuxedo 
 Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino 
 Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino 
 [MCA:] 
 I burn the competition like a flamethrower 
 My rhymes age like wine as I get older 
 I'm getting bolder, competition is waning 
 I got the feeling and assume the lane and 
  
 [Hook:] 
 We got a party on the left, a party on the right 
 We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight 
 Make some noise if you're with me 
 Make some noise if you're with me 
 [Mike D:] 
 Armed insurrection, popular election 
 Get paid every year like tax collection 
 Hear my perfection, rotary connection 
 Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection 
 [MCA:] 
 I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed 
 You must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted 
 And sifted, I'm just whiffed 
 And when I catch MCs it's time for wing-clipping 
 [Ad-Rock:] 
 I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle 
 A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle 
 My ego is off and running and gone 
 Cause I'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong 
  
 [Hook] 
 [MCA:] 
 Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision 
 I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching 
 Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf 
 And you can show it to your friends and say "that's my old self" 
 [Ad-Rock:] 
 Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada 
 Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada 
 The forbidden dance, here's my chance 
 To make romance in my B-boy stance 
 [Mike D:] 
 Parlay romancing into the financing 
 Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson 
 The roaches check in, but they never check out 
 I set the record straight, no doubt 
  
 [Hook]Well they were all impressed with your Halston dress 
 Yes people that you knew at Elaine's 
 Well the story of your latest success 
 Kept 'em so entertained 
  
 Well you had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 Had to turn the party out 
 You had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 You had to open up your mouth 
 You had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 Always got the piece of crowd 
  
 You had to have a white hot spotlight 
 You had to be a big shot last night, whoa 
  
 They were all impressed with your Halston dress 
 And the people that you knew at Elaine's 
 And the stories of your latest success 
 Kept 'em so entertained 
  
 Well I'm not sure what you said last night 
 No I'm not sure that you want to know 
 Well here's one hint honey 
 You sure did put on a show 
  
 Well you had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 Had to go and please the crowd 
 You had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 Always turned the party out 
 Had to have the front page, last night 
 Just to open up your mouth 
 You had to be a big shot, didn't you 
 Had to have the front page, last night Oh

 Listen to the bass pound 
 From all type of angles 
 This ain't no star spangled banner 
 More juice than tropicana 
 Rock from New York to Savannah 
 Cause it's Macka Framma? 
 When I go to a show 
 Some run some come plenty have fun 
 To watch a nig get dumb 
 The right way, the hype way, the tight way 
 You're f**king right that I might say... 
 Chorus 
 Fronters get confronted while stunts get stunted 
 And my homies get blunted while the rats get hunted 
 So if you want it here it is so put em up or shut em up 
 Smack'em down and I'll yell pick'em up so get'em up 
 Word em up, as I f**k it up I tear it up 
 So listen up and don't move just play the groove 
 Don't dime when I crime cause kid that's 
 Fessin' up but when I pull out my mag 
 Just raise em up 
 Chorus 
 One to the Three to the motherf**kin' two 
 And you don't know what I'ma do 
 That's because you're new but 
 I got the kaya ta make you feel higher 
 So say what you want you motherf**kin' liar 
 Don't mean to boast I don't mean to brag but I got the grab bag 
 Of funky shit you wish you had 
 But It's the pace that we gotta pick up so stickem up 
 Hands high reach for the sky 
 But don't try to get fly cause it's easy to die 
 Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang 
 Boom bang rat ta tat tat 
 Watch your back cause I'm coming black 
 Kill that yig yag put the money in the bag 
 Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag 
 But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot 
 Now ya gotta run what'cha got 
 ChorusWho is it? 
  
 Who is it? 
  
 Who is it? 
  
 Who is it?If You Can Feel What I'm Feeling Then It's A Musical Masterpiece 
 But If You Can Hear What I'm Dealing With Then That's Cool At Least

 Mowing Down M.C.'s Like I'm Mowing A Lawn 
 I Go Off Like Nothing Can Phase Me 
 You Think We'll Ever Meet Stevie? One Of These Days, D 
  
 But I Can Stand My Ground And I Am Down 
 To Wax An M.C. Who Acts Like A Clown 
 But For Now, I'd Like To Ask You How 
 You Like The Feel Of The Bass In Your Face In The CrowdGet with it 
 Get with it 
 Get with it 
 Got beats that are boomin' to keep the crowd movin' 
 'Cause this administration needs some removin' 
 Since 9/11, got war on the brain 
 This U.S. nation needs show restraint 
  
 Oh, no way, what’s that, you say? 
 The U.N. don't mean nothin' to the U.S.A.? 
 Oh, no way, what’s that you heard? 
 Bush is makin' money off of the oil, word? 
  
 Never ending government spendin' 
 All for weapons of war, they keep on spendin' more 
 Trouble believing, all this deceiving 
 Is it really freedom that we're fighting for? 
  
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
  
 Imagine public healthcare, public housing 
 Public help without the religious founding 
 Imagine that, well, it could happen yet 
 And we can make it happen, it's a bet 
  
 Now I'm not trying to say I hate the U.S.A 
 I'd live somewhere else if I felt that way 
 But go back to the fifty's, if you think it's all nifty 
 This president is acting mad-shifty 
  
 FBI and the cops keep all filing 
 Who protest the war and who they're dialing 
 So be careful what you say up on the internet 
 We got a nosy government that won't forget 
  
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
  
 Need a little democratic socialism 
 Eassssse up on the capitalism 
 Eassssse up on the militarism 
 Ease up on the campaign finance schism 
  
 The next thing they'll want is abortion deaded 
 If you're not straight, white, and married, it's dreaded 
 Forget it, you know what they say, if you,re gay 
 You're not a real member of society 
  
 If you're with me say, What is this? 
 Our government's being run by big business 
 Wrecking shop, so let's fix this 
 Come on somebody and get with this 
  
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 Get with it 
 Get with it 
 Get with it 
 Get with it 
 Get with itEverybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 I sneak a chicken tikka 
 Marsala at a gala event 
 I represent that's stupid that's for sure 
 You be like "oh yeah Adam, real mature" 
 I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye 
 All this cheese is gonna make me cry 
 Gorgonzola, Provolone 
 Don't even get me started on this microphone 
 Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka 
 I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper 
 On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy 
 Make you do like Fred Sanford with "I'm comin' Wheezy!" 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis 
 Got the edge and I've got the advantage 
 If you could see things from my vantage 
 Point then you could better understand this 
 I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night 
 I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight 
 When it comes to panache I can't be beat 
 I got the most style from below Fourteenth Street 
 Internationally known as the Keebler Elf 
 Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf 
 I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti 
 Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps 
 Posing like you're rolling with that camp 
 In layman's terms let me break it down 
 You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder 
 I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back 
 So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrac 
 I'm a simple man like Chance Gardner 
 Working nine to five Dolly Parton 
 Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama 
 Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama? 
 Goodness gracious golly gee 
 Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie! 
  
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Everybody get down huh 
 Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 
  
 Freak out with the genie...InstrumentalLike stacks of thoughts 
 Got tired and worn 
 Used over and over 'till they were tired and torn 
 Like a broken clock that can’t tell time 
 Like a thick ass book mine that’s mine 
 Like a band… 
  
 That’ll be fine 
 Alright 
 It’ll be fun more than fine, I think 
 No, I think it’ll be fun and fine 
 See, that’s what we’re trying to get, to get 
 That’s... That’s the... You’re in that place again 
 In that special place again. (someone burps) 
 Oh, I’m so happy to be in that special place again. (laughing) 
 I love the place I’m in 
 I’m in that perfect headspace again. (more laughing) 
 (*a small tune*) Oooh, woo, woo, woo 
 Don’t get in my headspace baby 
 Hey, MarioWho's Country Mike? 
 I'm Country Mike 
 Where's Country Mike? 
 Here's Country Mike 
 Who's Country Mike? 
 I'm Country Mike 
 Yeah Country Mike 
 I'm Country Mike 
  
 Read those boys the news

 Where's Country Mike? 
 Here's Country Mike 
 He's Country Mike 
 Ah-Ha!"Bet you're wondering what's been going on 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind" 
  
 My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on 
 We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong 
 And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme 
 When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong 
  
 At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention 
 That I am well aware of your wack intentions 
 To usurp my prose you so-and-so 
 It's my primary bone of contention 
  
 I tell you, everybody, I've had it 
 With all these people with static 
 I'll go insane if it don't rain 
 Sucker MCs are problematic 
  
 I love it when you hit those switches 
 A curve ball's what my pitch is 
 So here we—here we come 
 Like dum-ditty-dum 
 I keep all five boroughs in stitches 
  
 "You're right, man" 
  
 Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound 
 Sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex 
 It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex 
 Until you feel no pain inside your brain 
 All your worries are soothed by the sound effects 
  
 Read it in the Post and the Daily News 
 Listen everybody lets show improve 
 Don't let me begin about heroin 
 Living six feet deep just ain't the move 
  
 We're giving you soul power 
 I like it sweet and sour 
 When it comes to rhymes and beat designs 
 I'm at the control tower 
  
 Tell me what makes you so afraid 
 Of all these people you say you hate 
 Just give it one time for your mind 
 And let's try to negotiate 
 C'mon, let's try to negotiate 
 Let's try to negotiate 
  
 "Bet you're wondering what's been going on 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind 
 Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up 
 And Then I Fuck It Up And Then I Turn It In 
 And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound 
 And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And 
 Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap 
 Because I'm Shopping At Sears, Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap 
 Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations 
 Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations 
 Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line 
 Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes 
 I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit 
 A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick 
 Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets 
 And I Don't Give Fuck Cause I've Got The Beats 
 Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And 
 Right To Left And I'm Death Defying 
  
 (Chorus) 
 I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak 
 Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back 
 I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track 
 Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back 
 As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another 
 In These Times Of Melding Cultures 
 I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent 
 I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent 
 Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion 
 Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion 
 My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy 
 You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy 
 I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Sheep 
 For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step 
 So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am 
 And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann 
  
 (Chorus) 
 I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two 
 A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool 
 A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change 
 For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged 
 I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight 
 And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light 
 Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And 
 I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef 
 I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit 
 I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt 
 I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions 
 Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function 
 We Create This World And The Problems Go On 
 Create Our Lives And The Things That Gor Wrong 
 So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen 
 To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing 
  
 (Chorus)Shall we try it one time? 
 Mikey? 
  
 Shall we start on the one, or in the middle of the bar? 
 No, start on the one 
 Okay 
  
 Is that right? 
 For me, that was too, was that too quick, or? 
 It might have been right, I might have space 
 Let's just try it from the top again and see what happensDrink a six pack and then you play some ball 
 Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall 
 Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat 
 Two hundred seventy five pounds, that you can't forget 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Spend all your money on your health insurance plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Keep on getting bigger, because you know that you can 
 Why do you force yourself on top of that girl? 
 Laugh with all your buddies, because it's a man's man's world 
 Someday that shit will come back to you 
 You've been throwing your weight around and your shit is through 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Going nowhere, got no master plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Heart attack 
 Weighs in at two seventy five 
 Yeh, my man is lucky to be alive 
 Smokin' and drinkin' too 
 My man, the heart attack man, is gonna be running over you 
 Got no God damn respect 
 Had to put the big big bitch ass in check 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Time to change your ways heart attack man 
 {What do we know about partying or anything else?}There weren't no rhymin' at the beginning right there 
  
 Ahh yeah, I'm just gonna bring them in like an introduction 
 I gotcha, I gotcha super Mario. Mario... Mario 
  
 Ahhhhright y'all, comin' to you with full force 
 Yo, I'm not on the sauce 
 But we gonna do it a little something like this 
  
 Never trust a HAL-9000 
 When it comes to fire, I'm dousin' 
 Pick up your mic and start joustin' 
 Prayin' mantis style, not Shaolin 
  
 I don't want the capers, I'm frownin' 
 Order in vegertarian shark's fin 
 Throwin' chrome-domes in a tail spin 
 'Cause I don't drink scotch and I don't drink gin 
  
 When it comes to books with rhymes within 
 Packed like sardines in a tin 
 Tight-ass parties I'm roustin' 
 Karate-chop some round-housin' 
  
 Ahh, that was Mario's fault!

 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, never sound so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin' 
  
 Let me get some action from the back section 
 We need body rocking not perfection 
 Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc 
 Let your spine unwind just take a risk 
  
 I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn 
 Tell me party people is that so wrong? 
 The ship is docking, inter-lockin' 
 And up-rockin' electro-shocking 
  
 We're getting down computer action 
 Do the robotic satisfaction 
 All of y'all get off the wall 
 Have a ball and get involved with 
  
 Body movin', body movin', (Stand erect) 
 A1 sound, never sound so soothing (Arms down) 
 Body movin', body movin', (Swing left arm big) 
 We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin' (Same with the right) 
  
 Flame on, I'm gone 
 I'm so sweet like a nice bon-bon 
 Came out rapping when I was born 
 Mom said "rock it till the break of dawn" 
  
 Puttin' bodies in motion cause I got the notion 
 Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion 
 The sound of the music makin' you insane 
 You can't explain to people this type of mind frame 
  
 Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape 
 I'm fine like wine when I start to rap 
 We need body rockin' not perfection 
 Let me get some action from the back section 
  
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, never sound so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin' 
  
 (Hop it) 
 (Left arm ready and...) 
 (One!) 
 (And again) 
 (Stand erect) 
  
 Mike D with the master plan 
 I said, ooh my my and thank you ma'am 
 And when I grab the mic you scream "Ooh god damn" 
 The crème de la crème is who I am 
  
 MCA where have you been? 
 Packed like sardines in the tin 
 So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins 
 'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim 
  
 Ad Rock light up the place 
 And if you pull my card you pull the ace 
 And if you ask me turn up the bass 
 And if you play Defender, I could be your hyper space 
  
 Body movin', body movin' 
 A1 sound, never sound so soothing 
 Body movin', body movin' 
 We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

 For their Counterclaims against Plaintiff and Counterclaim-Defendant GoldieBlox, Inc. (“GoldieBlox”), Brooklyn Dust Music, Beastie Boys and Adam Horovitz (collectively, the “Beastie Boys Defendants”), together with Michael Diamond and Dechen Yauch as executor of the estate of Adam Yauch, deceased (collectively, with the Beastie Boys Defendants, the “Beastie Boys Parties”), aver as follows: 
  
  
 ...Facts Applicable To All Counterclaims 
 11.	As an integral part of GoldieBlox’s marketing campaign to sell books and toys that it claims are designed to “inspire the next generation of female engineers” (a profession defined by innovation and original thinking), GoldieBlox has engaged in the systematic infringement of intellectual property from numerous popular music groups, including Beastie Boys. 
  
 12.	As part of that systematic campaign of infringement, GoldieBlox has created a series of video advertisements set to well-known songs from popular artists in an effort to achieve the company’s primary goal of selling toys. 
  
 13.	Upon information and belief, GoldieBlox has produced and published videos that infringe upon popular songs by Beastie Boys, Queen, Daft Punk, Kaskade, Krewella, Avicii, Slam, k.flay and Trevor Guthrie. 
  
 14.	In some instances, GoldieBlox has altered the lyrics of the popular songs featured in its video advertisements in order to tailor those songs to the company’s goal of selling toys. 
  
 15.	One of the popular songs that GoldieBlox altered for use in its video advertisements is “Girls,” the seventh and final single from the Beastie Boys’ 1987 debut album Licensed to Ill. “Girls” is a sarcastic anthem. 
  
 16.	Upon information and belief, on or about November 18, 2013 GoldieBlox published a video advertisement entitled “GoldieBlox, Rube Goldberg, & Beastie Boys ‘Princess Machine’” on its own website and uploaded it to the popular internet video website Youtube.com. (Hereinafter, the “GoldieBlox Advertisement”.) At or around that time, GoldieBlox began promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement through, among other things, its accounts on the social media websites Twitter.com and Facebook.com. 
  
 17.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement posted on the GoldieBlox website and Youtube.com, as well as substantially all of GoldieBlox’s social media posts promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement, used and explicitly referred to the Beastie Boys’ name and identity. 
  
 18.	The “Beastie Boys” name and identity is readily associated with Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch, both individually and collectively and have come to signify the musical, artistic, and other creations by Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch individually, as well as collectively under the name “Beastie Boys,” and to identify each of them as individual members of the recording and performing group Beastie Boys. 
  
 19.	The Beastie Boys Parties are the owners of the common law and registered trademark BEASTIE BOYS® for use with, among other things, musical sound recordings and video recordings featuring musical performances. The BEASTIE BOYS® mark is registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as U.S. Reg. No. 4,197,406, and has been in continuous use since 1982. That registration is valid and subsisting under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, et seq. 
  
 20.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement is of a commercial nature and used the Copyrighted Work and the BEASTIE BOYS® mark to advertise GoldieBlox’s products, without any of the Beastie Boys Parties’ consent or authorization. 
  
 21.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement featured the Beastie Boys musical composition “Girls” with lyrics modified to become a “jingle” to sell GoldieBlox’s products. 
  
 22.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement promptly became a viral hit on the internet, garnering over 8 million views on Youtube.com alone in just ten days. The GoldieBlox Advertisement also received massive coverage in the press, which primarily focused on its apparently, but not in fact, approved use of the Beastie Boys’ song. 
  
 23.	Upon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement directly coincided with and directly resulted in a massive increase in the sales of GoldieBlox’s products. 
  
 24.	Upon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement and GoldieBlox’s marketing strategy of infringing upon the Copyrighted Work directly resulted in the company’s product line being featured as one of the most popular toy lines for the 2013 holiday season on the internet shopping website Amazon.com. 
  
 25.	Upon information and belief, on or about November 20, 2013, a representative from an advertising agency contacted Universal Music Publishing Group (the administrator of Brooklyn Dust’s and Horovitz’s copyrights in the Copyrighted Work) to ascertain whether GoldieBlox had obtained a license from the Beastie Boys Parties and their publisher or their administrator for the use of the underlying song “Girls” in the GoldieBlox Advertisement. Upon information and belief, the request was made because the advertising agency was in the process of submitting the GoldieBlox Advertisement to a competition, sponsored by Intuit Inc., to win a 30-second television commercial spot during the 2014 Super Bowl. 
  
 26.	On November 21, 2013, counsel for the Beastie Boys Parties contacted counsel for GoldieBlox to inquire about the company’s use of the Beastie Boys song in the GoldieBlox Advertisement. 
  
 27.	On that very same day, GoldieBlox filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 
  
 28.	Upon information and belief, GoldieBlox achieved and continues to achieve additional publicity, press coverage, and, upon information and belief, greater sales of its products, as a direct result of the Beastie Boys’ perceived affiliation with the GoldieBlox Advertisement. 
  
 29.	Unfortunately, rather than developing an original advertising campaign to inspire its customers to create and innovate, GoldieBlox has instead developed an advertising campaign that condones and encourages stealing from others. Accordingly, the Beastie Boys Parties assert the following counterclaims.(strange sounds in the background) 
 "You don't stop" 
 "You don..."InstrumentalRiddle me this my brother, can you handle it? 
 Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it 
 Equinox symmetry and the balance is right 
 Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night 
 It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it 
 I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic 
 For those about to rock we salute you 
 The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 The music washes over and you're one with the sound 
 Well, who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall 
 And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al 
 And then the man upstairs, well I hope that he cares 
 If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire 
 We're just three MC's and we're on the go 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Only twenty four hours in a day 
 Only twelve notes well a man can play 
 Music for all, and not just one people 
 And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel 
 More Adidas sneakers that a plumber's got pliers 
 Got more suitst than Jacoby and Meyers 
 If not for my vices and my bugged out desires 
 My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires 
 So I'm out pickin' pockets at the atlantic antic 
 And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic 
 I mix business with pleasure way too much 
 You know wine, and women, and song, and such 
 I don't get blue, I gotta mean red streak 
 You don't pay the band, your friends, yo that's weak 
 Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks 
 Giving to the poor and I always give thanks 
 Becuase I got more stories that JD's got Salinger 
 I hold the title and you are the challenger 
 I've got money like Charles Dickens 
 I've got the girlies in the coup like the Colonel's got the chickens 
 And I always go out dapper like the Harry S. Truman 
 I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman 
 {I'm never gonna let them say that I don't love you} 
 Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts 
 And Adam's yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course 
 Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion 
 Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians 
 Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell 
 You like Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well 
 Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born 
 And we love the hot butter, on what? The popcorn 
 Sippin on wine and mackin' 
 Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin' 
 Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me holmes 
 {Being very proud of being MCs} 
 And the man upstairs I hope that he cares 
 If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire 
 Amps and crossovers, under my rear hood 
 Becuase the bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood 
 They tell us what to do? Hell no 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago 
 Shadrach, Mesach, AbednagoRoot down, I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my boot down 
 So how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down 
 Yeah, how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down 
 So how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down 
 Gonna break or damn, gonna kick it root down 
 It's not a put down, I put my foot down 
 And then I make some love, I put my root down 
 I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance 
 Everbody knows I'm known for dropping science 
 I'm electric like Dick Hyman 
 I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin' 
 Never let you down with the stereo sound 
 So Mike, get on the mic and turn it out 
 We're talking root down, I put my root down 
 And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down 
 I said root down, it's time to scoot down 
 I'm a step up to the mic in my goose down 
 Come up representing from the upper west 
 Money makin' putting me to the test 
 Sometimes I feel as low, I've been blessed 
 Because I'm doing what I want, so I never rest 
 Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys 
 Just strutting like the meters with the look-ka py py 
 'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born 
 But when the snow is falling, then I am gone 
 You might think that I'm a fanatic 
 A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic 
 But we kick it from the root when we break it on down 
 Jimmy Smith is my man, I wanna give him a pound 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 So how you wanna kick it, gonna kick it root down 
 Yes, how we gonna kick it, we gonna kick it root down 
 So how we gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down 
 We gonna break it or damn, gonna kick it root down 
 Well, Ad Rock, don't stop, come on 
 Just get on the mic with the tic and the tac 
 I'll fill you with the fuckin' rim like brim 
 I'm walking down your block and you say that's him 
 There goes the guy with the funky sound 
 The Beastie Boys, you know we come to get down 
 Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick 
 And say oh my God, that's the funky shit 
 So I'm going to pass the mic and cause a panic 
 The original nasal kid is doing damage 
 Every morning I took the train to High Street station 
 Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation 
 On the way back up hearing battle tapes 
 Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes 
 It's like Harlem world battles on the Zulu beat show 
 It's Kool Moe D. vs. Busy Bee, there's one you should know 
 Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due

 Coffin going around 
 Have you seen mister Brown? 
 Coffin going around going around the town 
 Have you seen mister Brown? 
  
 Whispering voices 
 Whispering voices 
 Whispering voices 
 (Have you seen mister Brown) 
 They who want to control always lose control 
 They who wants everything always lose everything 
  
 Coffin going around 
 Have you seen mister Brown in town? 
 (Have you seen mister Brown) 
  
 They who want total control always lose control 
 Some always lose their soul for silver and gold 
 Silver and gold are by none 
 Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
 Rise up and walk, rise up and walk 
 Rise up and walk, rise up and walk 
  
 A weepin' time, weepin' time and reapin' time 
 Weepin' time and creepin' time 
 Reap what you sow 
 Rockin' comin' from the weepin' mind 
 And all that I reap is mine 
 So you cannot reap what is mine, say 
  
 Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
 Black ganja cigarette 
 Kindly weed and ganja marijuana lung's breath 
 Rise up and walk, rise up and clap 
 Rise up and hap, rise up and lift your cap 
 Lift up your cap and rise up and hap 
 Do the thunder clap, great ball of fire on the sky 
  
 And reap your time, weep your mind 
 Weepin' time, reapin' time, harvest, harvest time 
 You reap what you sow, I reap what I sow

 I. N. R. I. Production that takes over France 
 With voodoo dance and science arts 
 Science machine and science dream 
 This is a living dream from the Beastly Brothers 
 And the Beastie Boys with their beastly toys 
 To give you some beastly joys 
 So put on your beastly drawers 
 And show me a beastly pose 
  
 Heh, heh, heh, heh[Instrumental]That's a record 
  
 Uhhhh... 
 Huh 
  
 Yeah, I kick it root down 
 I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down

 Yeah, how you wanna’ kick it? 
 Gonna’ kick it root down 
 So how you gonna’ kick it? 
 Gonna’ kick it root down 
 Gonna’ break it on down, gonna’ kick it root down 
  
 It's not a put down 
 I put my foot down 
 And then I make some love, I put my root down 
 I’m like sweetie pie by the stone alliance 
 Everbody knows I'm known for dropping science 
 ‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman 
 I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin' 
 Never let you down with the stereo sound 
 So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out 
  
 We're talking root down, I put my boot down (boot down) 
 And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (loot down) 
 I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (scoot down) 
 I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (goose down) 
 Come up representing from the upper west 
 Money Making putting me to the test 
 Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed 
 Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it) 
  
 Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys 
 Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py" 
 Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born 
 But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee) 
 You might think that I'm a fanatic 
 A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic 
 So break it to the root when we kick it on down 
 Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound 
  
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 I kick it root down, I put my root down 
 So how you wanna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Cause how we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 So how we gonna kick it? 
 Gonna kick it root down 
 Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down (yeah) 
  
 Well, Adrock (huh) 
 Don't stop, come on 
 Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc 
  
 I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like brim 
 I'm walking down your block and you say that's him 
 There goes the guy with the funky sound 
 The Beastie Boys, you know we come to get down 
 Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick 
 And say “Oh my god, that's the funky shit! 
 So I’m-a pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah) 
 The original nasal kid is doing damage 
  
 Every morning I took the train to High Street Station 
 Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation 
 On the way back up, hearing battle tapes 
 Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes 
 Like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show 
 It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee 
 There's one you should know, (yeah) 
 Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due 
 MCA, grab the mic and ma bell will connect you 
  
 Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight 
 "If dancin' prays to the lord then I will feel alright" 
 It feels good to play a little music (music) 
 Tears running down my face ‘cause I love to do it (love to do it) 
 And no one can stop this flow from flowing on 
 A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah) 
 I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah)

 Gonna kick it root down 
 So how we gonna rock it? 
 Gonna rock it root down 
 Break it on down, gonna kick it root down 
  
 Yeah, that shit's on down 
  
 And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario 
 And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario 
 And that's a record, that's a record to Mario 
  
 Awww, now that's a record, buddy(Bet you're wonderin' what's been goin' on) 
 (Bet you think I've almost lost my mind) 
  
 My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on 
 We're comin with the lyrics and we're comin' strong 
 And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme 
 When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw 
  
 At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention 
 That I'm well aware of your wack intentions 
 To usurp my prose you so and so 
 It's my primary bone of contention 
  
 I tell you everybody I've had it 
 With all these people with static 
 I'll go insane if it don't rain 
 Sucker MC's are problematic 
  
 I love it when you hit those switches 
 A curve ball's what my pitch is 
 So here we here we come like dum ditty dum 
 I keep all five boroughs in stitches 
  
 The sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex 
 It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex 
 Until you feel no pain inside your brain 
 All your worries are soothed by the sound effects 
  
 Read it in the Post and the Daily News 
 Listen everybody let's show improve 
 Don't let me begin about heroin 
 Living six feet deep just ain't the move 
  
 We're giving you soul power 
 I like it sweet and sour 
 When it comes to rhymes and beat designs 
 I'm at the control tower 
  
 Tell me what makes you so afraid 
 Of all those people you say you hate 
 Just give it one time for your mind 
 And let's try to negotiate 
  
 Let's try to negotiate 
 Oh, let's try to negotiateOh my God. This record’s incredibleBeatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot 
 Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got 
 We keep the party movin to the broad day light 
 G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright 
  
 Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it 
 No limits to this style you know you can't lock it 
 First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it 
 But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket 
  
 Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze 
 Every thought in the mind is a planted seed 
 So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack 
 Before you know it they're boomeranging on back 
  
 I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher 
 I get 11 points off the word Quagmire 
 Fools can't see me and that's how it is 
 And that's how I like it cause that's my biz 
  
 Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot 
 Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got 
 We keep the party movin to the broad day light 
 G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright 
  
 Time's an illusion as the moments race by 
 Too fast to really grasp though we may try 
 Deny, till we die, ooh my my 
 These thoughts that mislead and then multiply 
  
 Second by second and minute by minute 
 It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it 
 Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise 
 Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes 
  
 So tell me what you need that you have got 
 Feeding on power will make your blood clot 
 It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong 
 That's why we can't all just get along 
  
 We're all connected like a Leggo set 
 One equaling one together like a croquette 
 Whether we have or have not yet met 
 Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat 
  
 Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot 
 Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got 
 We keep the party movin to the broad day light 
 G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright 
  
 You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain 
 The selfish ways just can't maintain 
 But these are the breaks when you try to come fake 
 Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked 
  
 I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12 
 I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf 
 You be like, hello nasty where you been 
 It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon 
  
 I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on 
 I get so hyped when I hear this song 
 It's gonna keep me happy like all day long 
 So go and talk shit 'cause it just makes me strong 
  
 Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash 
 Multinationals spreading like a rash 
 I might stick around or I might be a fad 
 But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad 
  
 Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot 
 Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got 
 We keep the party movin to the broad day light 
 G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright 
  
 Junior[Instrumental]Yeah, that's right 
 It's time to set the record straight 
 Ain't nobody got to spell it for me 
 I said, "Ain't nobody got to yell I can see" 
 I said, "Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear" 
 But if I have to I will yell in your ear 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 Check this out 
 Ain't nobody got to spell it for me 
 I said, "Ain't nobody got to yell I can see" 
 I said, "Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear" 
 But if I have to I will yell in your ear 
 Soul on fire 
 Soul on fire 
 And we ain't got no water 
 We don't have no water 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 No time for making up a monster to sell 
 Time for living, time for giving 
 No time for breakin' out a lie to sellThe shit with this bitch 
 Yo I said I'm calling you B 
 Yo B it's the phone 
 Yo B 
 "May I help you?" 
 "Yes what's your name?"

 "Yo yo yo" 
 "Yo yo yo" 
 "Beastie Boys rock!" 
 "Beastie Boys"And I’m dancin’ like I never 
 Woooh! Oow! Haaa! Yo WOOOH![Instrumental]Like many of the millions of people who have seen your toy commercial "GoldieBlox, Rube Goldberg & the Beastie Boys," we were very impressed by the creativity and the message behind your ad. 
  
 We strongly support empowering young girls, breaking down gender stereotypes and igniting a passion for technology and engineering. 
  
 As creative as it is, make no mistake, your video is an advertisement that is designed to sell a product, and long ago, we made a conscious decision not to permit our music and/or name to be used in product ads. When we tried to simply ask how and why our song "Girls" had been used in your ad without our permission, YOU sued US.Yeah... GET UP! 
 Yeah, uhh... 
 And then... 
 Yes here we go again, give you more, nothin lesser 
 Back on the mic is the anti-depressor 
 Ad-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this 
 The best is yet to come and yes, believe this 
 Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego 
 Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo 
 Sippin coffee playin Keno, in the casino 
 Want a lucky number? Ask Mike Dino 
 Yo I burn the competition like a flame thrower 
 My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older 
 I'm gettin bolder, competition is wanin 
 I got the feelin, assume the lane and 
 Make some noise if you're with me... 
 Make some noise if you're with me... 
 Armed insurrection, popular election 
 Get paid every year like tax collection 
 Hear my perfection, rotary connection 
 Takin emcees down by lethal rap injection 
 I'm like an ornithologist, when I get pissed 
 You must have drank a fizzy-liftin drink and you got lifted 
 And sifted, I'm just whiffin 
 When I catch you emcees it's time for wing-clippin 
 I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle 
 A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle 
 My ego, is off, and runnin, and gone 
 Cause I'm about the best and if you diss then that's wrong 
 Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision 
 I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitchin 
 Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf 
 Then you can show it to your friends and say "That's my old self" 
 Can't do me nuttin, can't tell me nada 
 Don't quote me now because I'm doin the lambada 
 The forbidden dance, here's my chance 
 To make romance in my b-boy stance 
 Parlayed romancin, into financin 
 Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson 
 The roaches check in, but they never check out 
 I set the record straight, no doubt(instrumental)[Instrumental]"C'mon"

 Yo, what's up? 
 Sucka emcees, check the footnotes, ya'll 
 Word up. Ready, bite 'cha ass 
 Oh, word? 
  
 Yo what the schnitzel, we're back 
 Shit's getting duller and duller and that's a fact 
 I don't care what you heard or care what you seen 
 I swear it wasn't me in Bear magazine 
 Because I'm not that hairy, oh contrary 
 I go with the flow though the tempo varies 
 So twist the cap and pop the cork 
 You know it's Adrock, made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 What the ponytail, I don't eat snail 
 I'll steal your keys and then I'll check your mail 
 Cause I'm the creepy crawler that be crawling your walls 
 And I'm the shot caller when it comes to shot calls 
 And I'll be rockin' parties from block to block 
 And block party to party the neighborhoods on lock 
 So hide your eyes, wait, I saw you looking 
 The name's MCA, made in downtown Brooklyn 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo what the parsley, parsley to the teeth 
 I'm a rhyme style writer, you're a rhyme style thief 
 I may be paranoid, you tried to fade me 
 Here's a song for you, "Lady" 
 Make you bug out like you don't know what to do 
 Your momma says, "Shame on you" 
 When you're dancing with your crew 
 So get that poor chicken up off your fork 
 My name's Mike D, made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo what the falafel, you gotta get up awful 
 Early to fool Mr. Furley 
 And that's word to Aunt Shirley and you could 
 Stick your head in the toilet give yourself a swirley 
 Listen up, biters - go please stop 
 While I'm politicin' at Murray's Cheese Shop 
 Believe what you heard, when you talk 
 You know it's Adrock made in New York 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 What the phone booth, word to hair mouse 
 You're on the corner and you're selling a hog's tooth 
 Don't mean to dis but I've got to point out 
 The hogs tooth belong inside the hog's mouth 
 Like Ernest Shackleton said to Ord Lees 
 I'll have dog pemmican with my tea 
 Now pass me the wok cause I'm cookin' 
 The names MCA, made in Downtown Brooklyn 
  
 Oh word? 
  
 Yo, what the doofus, say good night 
 You're Snidely Whiplash, I'm Dudley Do-you-right 
 Times are off the hinges, leave your 2-way at the door 
 We're all up the creek, a long way from shore 
 I'm not walking around, looking to get you cake 
 The D is for Diamonds, not for Drakes 
 This is not a fantasy and I'm not Mr. O'Rourke 
 The name's Mike D, made in New York 
  
 Oh word?[Instrumental](instrumental)[Instrumental]Drink a six pack and then you play som ball 
 Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall 
 Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat 
 Two hundred seventy five punds that you can't forget 
  
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Spend all your money on your health insurance plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Keep on getting bigger because you know that you can 
  
 Why do you force yourself on top of that girl 
 Laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's man's world 
 Someday that shit will come back to you 
 You've been throwing your weight around and 
 Your shit is through 
  
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Going nowhere, got no master plan 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Heart attack 
  
 Weighs in at two seventy five 
 Yeh my man is lucky to be alive 
 Smokin' and drinkin' too 
 My man the heart attack man is gonna be running over you 
 Got no god damn respect 
 Had to put the big big bitch-ass in check 
  
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam 
 Heart attack, heart attack man 
 Time to change your ways heart attack man 
  
 What do we know about partying or anything else?[Ad-Rock:] 
 Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser 
 Back on the mic is the anti-depressor 
 Ad-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this 
 The best is yet to come, and yes, believe this'Cause nobody can do it 
 Like Mix Master can! C'mon 
 I got the D, Double O 
 D, Double O STYLE![Intro] 
 I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now 
 Never 
 It's all been leading up to this moment 
 All right now, right here, know'm'sayin' 
 My whole life, right here 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 We got rhyme selections in a wide array 
 J'ai des bonbons pour vous manger 
 The party people scream, "Oui, oui, c'est vrai" 
 'Cause I got a remote for my bidet 
  
 Now A-D-R-O-C-K 
 I use the microphone like Picasso used clay 
 Down with Freckles from around the way 
 Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay 
  
 I rock on the mic from here to Bombay 
 I give it my best and say come what may 
 'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay 
 I'm looking sideways like my man Pele 
  
 Gettin' on like Ali bomaye 
 So fed up with racism today 
 Time to speak up and not turn away 
 Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Dip dip dive, so socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be alive 
  
 ("Bringin' back that old New York rap") 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height 
 I shine on the mic like UltraBright 
 Created a monster with these rhymes I write 
 Goatee metal rap, please say goodnight 
  
 Now here's a little something that you might not like 
 My DJ's name is Mix Master Mike 
 It's a real pity that you people got to bite 
 But I could understand because he sounds so nice 
  
 Reading you the news 'cause I'm Country Mike 
 Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights 
 Try to keep clear of that hate and spite 
 So I keep my mind still like the still of night 
  
 Now, who in the world do you want to fight? 
 It's against the system, we should unite 
 Homophobics ain't alright 
 If you learn to love, then you might love life 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Dip dip dive so-socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be alive 
  
 [DJ Babu scratch] 
 ("Bringin' back that old New York rap") 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts 
 So many billionaires while so many lack 
 So before the poor decide to react 
 Well, come on party people and share up your stacks 
  
 Now I'm-a break it down to the brass tacks 
 Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch 
 You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch 
 Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch 
  
 I'd like to have a say on the income tax 
 Don't wanna help build bombs and that's the facts 
 No money for health care so what's the catch? 
 The man got you locked with no key to the latch 
  
 Mike and Adam have got my back 
 You bring the mic and we'll bring the raps 
 Turn on the PA and rock your shack 
 Don't smoke cheeba, can't stand crack 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Dip dip dive, so-socialize 
 Open up your ears and clean out your eyes 
 If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise 
 It could be nice to be alive

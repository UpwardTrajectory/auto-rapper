[Intro: Justin Timberlake] 
 You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you 
 You'd steal the food right out my mouth 
 And I'd watch you eat it 
 I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh 
 (Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me) 
 You curse my name in spite to put me to shame 
 Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean 
 Give it up for fame 
 But I still don't know why, why I love it so much 
 (Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me) 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you 
 I just can't crack your code 
 One day you screamin' you love me loud 
 The next day you're so cold 
 One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care 
 You're so unfair 
 Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over 
 Holy Grail 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Blue told me remind you niggas, uh 
 Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh 
 Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh 
 But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh 
 Goddamn it, I like it 
 Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson 
 All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight 
 But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight 
 Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me 
 What I do? I took her back 
 Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that 
 Enough to make me wanna murder 
 Momma, please just get my bail 
 I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh 
  
 [Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Jay Z] 
 And we all just entertainers 
 And we're stupid and contagious 
 And we all just entertainers 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you 
 I just can't crack your code 
 One day you screamin' you love me loud 
 The next day you're so cold 
 One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care 
 You're so unfair 
 Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over 
 Holy Grail 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 Now I got tattoos on my body 
 Psycho bitches in my lobby 
 I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi 
 Can't even take my daughter for a walk 
 See 'em by the corner store 
 I feel like I'm cornered off 
 Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off 
 Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though? 
 I'm gettin' high, sittin' low 
 Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window 
 This fame hurt, but this chain worse 
 I think back you asked the same person 
 If this is all you had to deal with 
 Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work 
 This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt 
 Niggas dying back where I was birthed 
 Fuck your iris and the IRS 
 Get the hell up off your high horse 
 You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours 
 Why you mad? Take the good with the bad 
 Or throw the baby out with that bath water 
  
 [Bridge: Jay Z] 
 You still alive, still that nigga 
 Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger 
 Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa 
 Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you 
 I just can't crack your code 
 One day you screamin' you love me loud 
 The next day you're so cold 
 One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care 
 You're so unfair 
 Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over 
 Holy Grail 
  
 [Bridge: Justin Timberlake] 
 You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it 
 And you take the blade right out my heart 
 Just so you can watch me bleed 
 And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah 
 (Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me) 
 And you play this game in spite to drive me insane 
 I got it tattooed on my sleeve 
 Forever in ink with guess whose name 
 But I still don't know why, why our love is so much, yeah 
 (Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me) 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you 
 I just can't crack your code 
 One day you screamin' you love me loud 
 The next day you're so cold 
 One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care 
 You're so unfair 
 Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over 
 Holy Grail

 Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway? 
 Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché 
 Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway? 
 Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché 
 What about the bad guy goes good, yeah? 
 An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah? 
 Black hour glass, our glass 
 Toast to clichés in a dark past 
 Toast to clichés in a dark past 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman 
 Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running 
 Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh 
 Fuck what you say, boys in blue say 
  
 [Beyoncé] 
 I don't care if we on the run 
 Baby as long I'm next to you 
 (Uhuu) 
 And if loving you is a crime 
 Tell me why do I bring out the best in you 
 Why 
  
 [Bridge: Beyoncé] 
 I hear sirens while we make love 
 Loud as hell, but they don't know 
 They're nowhere near us 
 I will hold your heart and your gun 
 I don't care if they come, noooo 
 I know it's crazy but 
  
 [Hook: Beyoncé] 
 They can take me 
 Now that I found the places that you 
 Take me 
 Without you I got nothing to lose 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick 
 Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit 
 Matching tats, this Ink don't come off 
 Even if rings come off, if things ring off 
 My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty 
 My lady is, my Mercedes is 
 My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas 
 Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas 
 You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga 
 You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas 
 Ugh 
 Cross the line, speak about mine 
 I'ma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine 
 Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack 
 Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that 
 I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl 
 'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming 
  
 [Hook: Beyoncé] 
 They can take me 
 Now that I found the places that you 
 Take me 
 Without you I got nothing to lose 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Deeper than words, beyond right 
 Die for your love, beyond life 
 Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice 
 Blind me baby with your neon lights 
 Ray Bans on, police in sight 
 Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white 
 If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell 
 Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's 
 She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy 
 What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys 
 They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it 
 If it's me and you against the world, then so be it 
  
 [Beyoncé] 
 I don't care if they give me life 
 I get all of my life from you 
 (Uhuu) 
 And if loving you had a price 
 I would pay my life for you 
  
 [Bridge: Beyoncé] 
 I hear sirens while we make love 
 Loud as hell, but they don't know 
 They're nowhere near us 
 I will hold your heart and your gun 
 I don't care if they come, noooo 
 I know it's crazy but 
  
 [Outro: Beyoncé] 
 I don't care I'll never give it up 
 Give it up, give it up, give it all away 
 No I swear I'll never give it up 
 Give it up, give it up, give it all away 
 I don't care I'll never give it up 
 Give it up, give it up, give it all away 
 No I swear I'll never give it up 
 Give it up, give it up, give it all away

 House nigga, don't fuck with me 
 I'm a field nigga, with shined cutlery 
 Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be 
 I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be 
 I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood 
 That your mama rentin' 
 Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood 
 That's how you rinse it" 
 I bought every V12 engine 
 Wish I could take it back to the beginnin' 
 I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO 
 For like 2 million 
 That same building today is worth 25 million 
 Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

 You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit 
 You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Financial freedom my only hope 
 Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke 
 I bought some artwork for one million 
 Two years later, that shit worth two million 
 Few years later, that shit worth eight million 
 I can't wait to give this shit to my children 
 Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine 
 But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99 
 I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8 
 I turned my life into a nice first week release date 
 Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh? 
 Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh 
 Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear 
 There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga

 Do I find it so hard 
 When I know in my heart 
 I'm letting you down every day 
 Letting you down every day 
 Why do I keep on running away? 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Look, I apologize, often womanize 
 Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes 
 Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles 
 Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you 
 I harassed you out in Paris 
 "Please come back to Rome," you make it home 
 We talked for hours when you were on tour 
 “Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!” 
 I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine” 
 That was my proposal for us to go steady 
 That was your 21st birthday 
 You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready 
 So I apologize 
 I seen the innocence leave your eyes 
 I still mourn this death and 
 I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present 
 Your body wouldn't accept it 
 I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions 
 'Cause I was emotionless 
 And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love 
 And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about 
 Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed 
 And you stare blankly into space 
 Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit 
 So I apologize 
  
 [Chorus: Kim Burrell] 
 I'm never gonna treat you 
 I'm never gonna treat you like I should 
 Ohhhhhh 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us 
 And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive 
 Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions 
 Or sleep with our back turned 
 We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn 
 We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops 
 And then meet in a space where the dark stop 
 And let love light the way 
 Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face 
 I never wanted another woman to know 
 Something about me that you didn't know 
 I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold 
 I suck at love, I think I need a do-over 
 I will be emotionally available if I invited you over 
 I stew over, what if you over my shit? 
  
 [Chorus: Kim Burrell] 
 I'm never gonna treat you 
 I'm never gonna treat you like I should 
 Ohhhhhh 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 And if my children knew 
 I don't even know what I would do 
 If they ain't look at me the same 
 I would prob'ly die with all the shame 
 "You did what with who?" 
 What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? 
 "You risked that for Blue?" 
 If I wasn't a superhero in your face 
 My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes 
 And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake 
 And you go online and see 
 For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay 
  
 [Chorus: Hannah Williams] 
 I'm never gonna treat you like I should[Intro: Pimp C] 
 "A little over a year ago I was in bondage. And now I'm back out here, reaping the blessings, and getting the benefits that go along with it. Everything that's out here for kings like us. The reason why we like this—this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff—they don't understand, it's because we really from Africa. And that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying? So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things. It's in our genes, know what I'm saying? We just don't all know our history, so…"

 I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here 
 I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere 
 I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos 
 Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's 
 Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street 
 Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry 
 Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus 
 Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas 
 Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie 
 Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me 
 Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais 
 Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives 
 Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee 
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from…

 You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though 
 But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though 
 Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks 
 Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop 
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back 
 For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add 
 Eight million stories out there in the naked 
 City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it 
 Me? I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"

 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders 
 So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is 
 Lined with casualties who sip the life casually 
 Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve! 
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style 
 And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out 
 The city of sin is a pity on a whim 
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them 
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out 
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route 
 "Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin 
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends 
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life 
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight 
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion 
 The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z] 
 In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah) 
 Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

 Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, "Yeah" (come on) 
 (Come on) Yeah (come on)

 Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast

 This water tells my story, this water knows it all 
 Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water 
 Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

 Dope boy still smelling like cocaina 
 White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner? 
 The oil spill that BP ain't clean up 
 I'm anti-Santa Maria 
 Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace 
 I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket 
 Black card go hard when I'm shopping 
 Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton 
 Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus 
 Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick 
 See me in shit you never saw 
 If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all 
 Aww, whole world's in awe 
 I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors 
 I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven

 I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those? 
 If you grew up with holes in your zapatos 
 You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough 
 I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole! 
 If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward." 
 Got beef with radio if I don't play they show 
 They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so 
 Rap mags try and use my black ass 
 So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads 
 Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as 
 Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has 
 I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
  
 [Hook] 
 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one 
 If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The year is '94, in my trunk is raw 
 In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law 
 Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or 
 Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor 
 And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake 
 Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case 
 So I pull over to the side of the road 
 I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?" 
 ‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low? 
 Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know 
 Am I under arrest or should I guess some more? 
 "Well, you was doing 55 in a 54 
 License and registration and step out of the car 
 Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are." 
 I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit 
 "Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?" 
 Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back 
 And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that 
 "Aren't you sharp as a tack? 
 You some type of lawyer or something? 
 Somebody important or something?" 
 Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit 
 Enough that you won't illegally search my shit 
 "Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!" 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
  
 [Hook] 
 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one 
 If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one 
 If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now once upon a time not too long ago 
 A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho 
 This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy 
 But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me 
 I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord 
 Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform 
 You know the type, loud as a motorbike 
 But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight 
 And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin' 
 And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain 
 And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again 
 Back through the system with the riff-raff again 
 Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again 
 Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em 
 D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again 
 Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African 
 All because this fool was harassin' them 
 Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine 
 But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun 
 I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
  
 [Hook] 
 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one 
 If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son 
 I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 
  
 [Outro] 
 You crazy for this one, Rick 
 It's your boy[Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling) 
 Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? 
 See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined 
 The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin' 
 What I do, through and through and 
 I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view 
 The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture 
 Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters 
 And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters 
 From botched robberies, niggas crouched over 
 Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over 
 Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked 
 "No, he's not around." Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down 
 I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round 
 Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways 
 Just read a magazine that fucked up my day 
 How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it? 
 I help them see they way through it—not you 
 Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes 
 Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt 
  
 [Verse 2: Eminem] 
 Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen 
 I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute 
 ‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it 
 But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it 
 Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? 
 Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics 
 Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? 
 But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it 
 Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit 
 Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish 
 But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America 
 As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment? 
 Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror 
 And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed 
 And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents 
 You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!) 
 And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? 
 I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo 
 ‘Cause, here we go; he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga 
 And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a— 
  
 [Hook: Eminem (& JAY-Z)] 
 —renegade! Never been afraid to say 
 What's on my mind at any given time of day 
 ‘Cause I'm a renegade! 
 Never been afraid to talk about anything 
 (Anything?) Anything! (Anything) 
 Renegade! (Never been afraid to say) 
 (What's on my mind at any given time of day) 
 (‘Cause I'm a) renegade! 
 (Never been afraid to holler about anything) 
 Anything? (Anything) Anything! 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles 
 Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent 
 Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench 
 What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in 
 By the bodega, iron under my coat 
 Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope 
 Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty 
 An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home 
 Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown 
 'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings 
 My demeanor, thirty years my senior 
 My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up 
 Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky 
 Big, I did it, multi before I die 
 No lie, just know I chose my own fate 
 I drove by the fork in the road and went straight 
  
 [Verse 4: Eminem] 
 See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare 
 Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here 
 To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as 
 A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist 
 But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste 
 We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is 
 Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? 
 Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today 
 See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie" 
 While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me 
 Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics 
 In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer 
 I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful 
 The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you 
 What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter 
 Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

 Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you 
 You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z 
 Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother 
 How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z? 
 And you know better, nigga, I know you do 
 But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue 
 You had no father, you had the armor 
 But you got a daughter, gotta get softer 
 Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days 
 You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z 
 Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real 
 But you can't heal what you never reveal 
 What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth 
 To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z 
 You got people you love you sold drugs to 
 You got high on the life, that shit drugged you 
 You walkin' around like you invincible 
 You dropped outta school, you lost your principles 
 I know people backstab you, I felt bad too 
 But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural 
 But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye 
 But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye 
 You gave him 20 million without blinkin' 
 He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'? 
 "Fuck wrong with everybody?" is what you sayin' 
 But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane 
 Crazy how life works 
 You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts 
 You stabbed Un over some records 
 Your excuse was "He was talkin' too reckless!" 
 Let go your ego over your right shoulder 
 Your left is sayin', "Finish your breakfast!" 
 You egged Solange on 
 Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong 
 You almost went Eric Benét 
 Let the baddest girl in the world get away 
 I don't even know what else to say 
 Nigga, never go Eric Benét! 
 I don't even know what you woulda done 
 In the future other niggas playin' football with your son 
 You woulda lost it 
 13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston 
 Nah, JAY-Z 
 Bye, JAY-Z[Produced by Timbaland] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I just want a Picasso 
 In my casa, no, my castle 
 I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole 
 I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle 
 I want a Rothko, no I want a brothel 
 No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute 
 Let's make love on a million 
 In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling 
 All for the love of drug dealing 
 Marble floors, gold ceilings 
 Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a billion 
 Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up 
 Condos in my condos, I wanna row of 
 Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA 
 Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Oh, what a feeling 
 Picasso baby 
 Picasso 
 Picasso baby 
 Oh, what a feeling 
 Picasso baby 
 Picasso 
 Picasso baby 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel 
 Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball 
 Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel 
 I just wanna live life colossal 
 Leonardo Da Vinci flows 
 Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes 
 See me throning at the Met 
 Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes 
 House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern 
 Cause I be going ape at the auction 
 Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion 
 Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa 
 The modern day version with better features 
 Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner 
 Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Oh, what a feeling 
 Picasso baby 
 Picasso 
 Picasso baby 
 Oh, what a feeling 
 Picasso baby 
 Picasso 
 Picasso baby

 [Verse 3] 
 I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but 
 Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box 
 They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox 
 My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops 
 Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop" 
 I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot 
 And you blow, I'm still the man to watch 
 Hublot on my left hand or not 
 Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops 
 Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop 
 Now my hand on the Bible on the stand 
 Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff 
 I'm like goddamn enough 
 I put down the cans and they ran amok 
 My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens 
 Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things 
 No sympathy for the king, huh? 
 Niggas even talk about your baby crazy 
 Eventually the pendulum swings 
 Don't forget America this how you made me 
 Come through with the 'Ye mask on 
 Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo 
 What's it gon take for me to go 
 For you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby[Intro] 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Goddammit 
 Let this shit knock 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I done turned Havana to Atlanta 
 Guayabera shirts and bandanas 
 Every time you think they got me I switch the planner 
 Bulletproof this, radio scanners (you got scanners, we got scanners) 
 Balling 'til they ban us 
 You getting too much bread, they try to jam you 
 Boy from the hood but got White House clearance 
 Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents 
 Politicians never did shit for me 
 Except lie to me, distort history 
 Wanna give me jail time and a fine 
 Fine, let me commit a real crime 
 I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef 
 Out of spite, I just might flood these streets 
 Hear the freedom in my speech 
 Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep 
 Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free 
 Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb 
 I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat 
 Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt 
 Obama said "Chill, you gonna get me impeached" 
 But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach 
  
 [Hook: Swizz Beatz] 
 Y'all gon' learn today 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Y'all must want to start a revolution 
 You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (Bang!) 
 Catch a body, head to Houston 
 I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans 
 This communist talk is so confusing 
 When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using 
 Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music 
 You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student 
 Oh, you gonna learn today 
 Where the fuck have you been 
 The world's under new management 
 The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit 
  
 [Hook][Intro: JAY-Z] 
 (Ha-ya) My nigga got on 
 (Ha-ya) My nigga got on all white, no socks 
 (Ha-ya, ha-ya) 
 My nigga got that cocaina on today 
 That's how he feel, turn my vocal up (Ha-ya) 
 That's how you feel, Emory? (Ha-ya) 
 Turn my vocal up some more 
 Turn my vocal up, Guru! (Ha-ya) 
 Turn the music up too (Ha-ya-ya-ya) 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Super Bowl goals 
 My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold 
 We in a whole different mode 
 The kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed 
 I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed 
 Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first 
 I told my wife the spiritual shit really work 
 Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all 
 Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt 
 All this old talk left me confused 
 You'd rather be old rich me or new you? 
 And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new 
 Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh 
 Nobody wins when the family feuds 
 But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit 
 I'm clear why I'm here, how about you? 
 Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute 
 (Mmmmm) Pretty much 
 If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us 
 Fuck rap, crack cocaine 
 Nah, we did that, Black-owned things 
 Hundred percent Black-owned champagne 
 And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams 
 Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah 
 But we ain't get through to you yet, uh 
 What's better than one billionaire? Two (two) 
 'Specially if they're from the same hue as you 
 Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth 
  
 [Interlude: JAY-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Hahahaha (Ha-ya) 
 I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin' (Ha-ya) 
 But that ain't even a statement (Ha-ya) 
 That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget (Ha-ya) 
 Wait, that ain't politically correct, forget it (Ha-ya) 
 Can I get "Amen" from the congregation? 
 Amen, amen (Ha-ya) 
 Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation? 
 Amen, amen (Ha-ya) 
 Ha-ya-ya-ya 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me 
 Let me alone, Becky 
 A man that don't take care his family can't be rich 
 I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit 
 My consciousness was Michael's common sense 
 I missed the karma that came as a consequence 
 Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin' 
 Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain 
 Nobody wins when the family feuds 
 We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools 
 I'm tryna fix you 
 I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official 
 Y'all think small, I think Biggie 
 Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi 
 Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies 
 How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me? 
 Old niggas never accepted me 
 New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis 
 We all lose when the family feuds 
 What's better than one billionaire? Two 
  
 [Interlude: JAY-Z] 
 Hahahah 
 I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC 
 Y'all need to stop

 Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war

 Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest 
 You bringin' them boys to men, how them boys gonna win? 
 This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch 
 Your reach ain't long enough, dunny 
 Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker 
 Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy 
 Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady

 You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya 
 Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour 
 Well, we don't believe you, you need more people

 ‘Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do 
 Don't let 'em gas you like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you."

 Mind from spirit, body from soul 
 They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole

 But along with celebrity comes about 70 shots to your frame 
 Nigga, you a (lame) 
 You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads 
 Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash 
 Had a spark when you started, but now you're just garbage 
 Fell from top 10 to not mentioned at all 
 To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours 
 Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin' song 
 But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine 
 That's why your (lame) career's come to an end 
 It's only so long fake thugs can pretend 
 Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad 
 You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life 
 I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor 
 Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser 
 So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong 
 You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song 
 And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then 
 I know who I paid, God – Serchlite publishin' 
 Use your (brain) – you said you've been in this 10 
 I've been in it five; smarten up, Nas! 
 Four albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide 
 That's one every… let's say two, two of them shits was doo 
 One was "nah," the other was Illmatic 
 That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average 
 And that's so (lame) 
 Nigga, switch up your flow, your shit is garbage 
 What you tryin' to kick, knowledge? 
 You niggas gonna learn to respect the king 
 Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen

 Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you

 Please, not Jay, he's not for play 
 I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks

 Get your fatigues on, all black everything 
 Black cards, black cars, all black everything 
 And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers 
 I get more in depth if you boys really real enough 
 This is la Familia, I'll explain later 
 But for now, let me get back to this paper 
 I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back 
 I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks 
 Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug 
 Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up 
 Hold up! 
  
 [Hook: Rihanna] 
 Life’s a game, but it's not fair 
 I break the rules, so I don’t care 
 So I keep doin' my own thang 
 Walkin' tall against the rain 
 Victory’s within the mile 
 Almost there, don’t give up now 
 Only thing that's on my mind 
 Is who’s gon' run this town tonight 
 Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy 
 Who’s gon' run this town tonight? 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 We are, yeah, I said it: we are 
 You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar 
 Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are 
 Microphone fiend, this the return of the God 
 Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher 
 I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela 
 On the table, screamin' 
 "Fuck the other side! They're jealous!" 
 We got a banquette full of broads 
 They got a table full of fellas 
 Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake 
 They should throw their hand in 
 ‘Cause they ain't got no spades 
 Yeah, my whole team got dough 
 So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row 
  
 [Hook: Rihanna] 
 Life’s a game, but it's not fair 
 I break the rules, so I don’t care 
 So I keep doin' my own thang 
 Walkin' tall against the rain

 Only thing that's on my mind

 Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy 
 Who’s gon' run this town tonight? 
  
 [Verse 3: Kanye West] 
 It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow 
 To everybody on your dick; no homo 
 I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos 
 Next time I’m in church: please, no photos 
 Police escorts, everybody passports 
 This the life that everybody ask for 
 This the fast life, we are on a crash course 
 What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4? 
 But I know that if I stay stunting 
 All these girls only gon' want one thing 
 I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting 
 Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming 
 She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string 
 And up top, ungh, two bee stings 
 And I'm beasting off the Riesling 
 And my nigga just made it out the precinct 
 We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring 
 I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring 
 Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things 
 Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings? 
 "What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels." 
 "Is that a May— what?!" "Baby, these wheels." 
 You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill 
 You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel 
  
 [Outro: Jay Z & Rihanna] 
 Whassup! 
 Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy 
 Yeah, yeah, whassup! 
 Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy

 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 Have you ever been to heaven? 
 Have you ever seen the gates? 
 Have you bowed unto your highness? 
 And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body 
 Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality 
 Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace 
 Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets 
 Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati 
 They can't believe this much skill is in the human body 
 He's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti? 
 Aw, fuck it, you got me 
 Question religion, question it all 
 Question existence until them questions are solved 
 Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh 
 Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship 
 Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo 
 Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit 
 Hello bitch, it's me again 
 Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 Have you ever been to heaven? 
 Have you ever seen the gates? 
 Have you bowed unto your highness? 
 And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down 
  
 [Bridge: Jay-Z] 
 That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion, losing my religion 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me? 
 Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini 
 I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down 
 Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition 
 And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova 
 From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up 
 I confess, God in the flesh 
 Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches 
 I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's 
 These are verses from the Bible 
 Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet 
 Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice 
 You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates 
 I had luggage, meaning I had baggage 
 Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters 
 Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh 
  
 [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] 
 Have you ever been to heaven? 
 Have you ever seen the gates? 
 Have you bowed unto your highness? 
 And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

 [Intro: Bobby Glenn + Jay Z] 
 Picture all the possibilities 
 Picture all the possibilities 
 Sounds like a love song 
 Sounds like a love song 
 The most incredible, baby 
 I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food 
 Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move 
 We was together on the block since free lunch 
 We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch 
 We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather 
 So now we travel first class to change the forecast 
 Never in bunches, just me and you 
 I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches 
 Still I left you for months on end 
 It's been months since I checked back in 
 We're somewhere in a small town 
 Somewhere lockin' a mall down 
 Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down 
 I can understand why you want a divorce now 
 Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it 
 Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with 
 But deep inside a nigga so sick 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z] 
 I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
 I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to let the song cry 
 I can't see it comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
 I can't see it comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 On repeat, the CD of Big's "Me & My Bitch" 
 Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit 
 Empty gun in your hand, sayin', "Let me see that clip!" 
 Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick 
 A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip 
 You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6 
 We was so happy poor, but when we got rich 
 That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped 
 Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit 
 Made me speed that quick, let me see — that's it 
 It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick 
 I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me 
 Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me 
 Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy 
 And then they got fuzzy 
 And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z] 
 I can't see it comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
 I can't see it comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
 Yeah, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes 
 But I got to make the song cry 
 I can't see it comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Z] 
 A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone 
 Word back home is that you had a special friend 
 So what was oh so special then? 
 You have given away without gettin' at me 
 That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me? 
 How was I to know that you was plain sick of me? 
 I know the way a nigga livin' was whack 
 But you don't get a nigga back like that! 
 Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that 
 You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that 
 You don't throw away what we had, just like that 
 I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back 
 They say you can't turn a bad girl good 
 But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever 
 I'll mourn forever 
 Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z] 
 I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to make the song cry 
 I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes 
 So I got to let the song cry

 This is a public service announcement 
 Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records 
  
 [Just Blaze] 
 Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Allow me to re-introduce myself 
 My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V 
 I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z 
 I guess even back then you can call me 
 CEO of the R-O-C, Hov! 
 Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire 
 I be the music biz number one supplier 
 Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name 
 Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right 
 Hov, OH—not D.O.C 
 But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better" 
 I check cheddar like a food inspector 
 My homey Strict told me, "Dude finish your breakfast" 
 So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude 
 With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace 
 Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this 
 I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*) 
 This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit) 
  
 [Interlude: Just Blaze] 
 Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE! 
 And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK! 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Ving ain't lie 
 I done came through the block in everything that's fly 
 I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex 
 I never claimed to have wings on 
 Nigga, I get my "by any means" on whenever there's a drought 
 Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm 
 You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game 
 I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change 
 And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me 
 Lying as if I am a different man 
 And I could blame my environment but 
 There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains 
 Hope you don't think users are the only abusers 
 Niggas getting high within the game 
 If you do then, how would you explain? 
 I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins 
 I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period 
 Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it 
 Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer 
 No matter where you go, you are what you are player 
 And you can try to change but that's just the top layer 
 Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here 
 Only God can judge me, so I'm gone 
 Either love me, or leave me alone 
  
 Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album[Intro: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder] 
 Good morn' or evening, friends 
 Smile, you recordin'? 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors 
 20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures 
 We drinkin' Cristal then 
 Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then 
 Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now 
 Tryna put a million on the whole team now 
 Push through the pain so we can see new life 
 So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice 
 Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian 
 Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian 
 Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate 
 Society shame and the pain was too much to take 
 Cried tears of joy when you fell in love 
 Don't matter to me if it's a him or her 
 I just wanna see you smile through all the hate 
 Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder] 
 Bad times turn to good memories, smile 
 Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile 
 Good times never fade away, smile 
 Even if I'm not with you here today, smile 
 Good morn' or evening, friends

 Here's your friendly announcer

 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Far as draft picks, my name did not get called 
 Bet before I go I put a billion on the board 
 Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen 
 Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh? 
 Flyin' paper planes through the projects 
 Now the whole projects on my jet 
 Now you see the real in the front row 
 In every one of y'all televised shows 
 Super facts 
 Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that 
 A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson 
 Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin' 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder] 
 Bad times turn to good memories, smile 
 Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile 
 Good times never fade away, smile 
 Even if I'm not with you here today, smile 
 Good morn' or evening, friends 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 I mastered my aesthetics 
 I know you often heard me wax poetic 
 'Bout bein' back in the Lexus 
 But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in 
 The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings 
 Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy 
 Anita Baker's "You Bring Me Joy" slappin' out of the toy 
 The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror 
 Objects is further than they appear 
 Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes 
 Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear 
 How niggas can't relate? 
 Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake 
 In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine 
 But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime 
 And niggas playin' for power, huh 
 So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses 
 Ours was, "Fuck you, pay me" 
 Now it's, "Fuck payin' me, I pay you 
 Put the rest away for Blue" 
 That blood money I giggle at it 
 Can't even support my miss' habit 
 Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed 
 Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin' 
 That's life, winners and losers 
 Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless 
 My therapist said I relapsed 
 I said, "Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips" 
 God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin' 
 God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain 
 A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ 
 Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you 
 Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you 
 Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you 
 Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh 
 Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to 
 This was meant to be a haiku, huh 
 But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two 
 Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove 
 This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you? 
 Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you 
 Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners 
 Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh 
 Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church 
 When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt 
 Fear for you, bro, we know the system don't work 
 Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt 
 Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny 
 Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise 
 That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap 
 That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that 
 All these people was gon' kill me, heh 
 'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me 
 Welcome back Carter, smile 
  
 [Outro: Gloria Carter] 
 Living in the shadow 
 Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live? 
 In the shadows people see you as happy and free 
 Because that's what you want them to see 
 Living two lives, happy, but not free 
 You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love 
 The world is changing and they say it's time to be free 
 But you live with the fear of just being me 
 Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be 
 No harm for them, no harm for me 
 But life is short, and it's time to be free 
 Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

 Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh 
 Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah 
 Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em 
 ‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em 
 Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good 
 But I don't fuckin' feed 'em 
 First time they fuss I'm breezin' 
 Talkin' about, "What's the reasons?" 
 I'm a pimp in every sense of the word 
 Bitch, better trust and believe 'em 
 In the cut where I keep 'em 
 'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts 
 Then it's "beep beep" and I'm pickin' them up 
 Let 'em play with the dick in the truck 
 Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs 
 Divorce him and split his bucks 
 Just because you got good head 
 I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up? 
 Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin' 
 Me give my heart to a woman? 
 Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin' 
 Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion 
 I got no patience and I hate waitin' 
 Ho, get your ass in and let's ride! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay Z] 
 We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese 
 Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s 
 We doin' big pimpin' up in N.Y.C 
 It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B 
  
 [Verse 2: Bun B] 
 Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario 
 Comin' straight up out the black barrio 
 Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho 
 Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o 
 Oops, my bad, that's "my scenario" 
 No, I can't fuck a scary ho 
 Now every time, every place, everywhere we go 
 Hoes start pointin', they say: "There he go!" 
 Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' 
 Heat than a little bit 
 We don't pull it out over little shit 
 And if you catch a lick when I spit 
 Then it won't be a little hit 
 Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch! 
 And step up your vocab! 
 Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me 
 And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB 
 Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it 
 But nigga if you hatin' I 
 Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked 
 Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh 
 Wet with two pairs of clothes on 
 Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track 
 Timbaland, let me spit my prose on 
 Pump it up in the pro-zone 
 That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on 
 Ain't the track that we flows on 
 But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone 
 We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man 
 For real, it don't get no bigger, man 
 Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip 
 Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool! 
  
 [Chorus 2: Bun B] 
 We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese 
 We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s 
 We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T 
 It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B 
  
 [Verse 3: Pimp C] 
 Smokin' out, pourin' up 
 Keepin' lean up in my cup 
 All my car got leather and wood 
 In my hood we call it "buck" 
 Everybody wanna ball 
 Holla at broads at the mall 
 If he up, watch him fall 
 Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all 
 If I wasn't rappin', baby 
 I would still be ridin' Mercedes 
 Comin' down and sippin' daily 
 No record 'til whitey pay me 
 Uhhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys? 
 Comin' down in candied toys 
 Smokin' weed and talkin' noise 
  
 [Chorus 2: Bun B] 
 We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese 
 We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s 
 We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T 
 It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 On the canopy, my stamina be 
 Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee 
 MTV jam of the week 
 Made my money quick, then back to the streets 
 But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray 
 Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin' 
 Still gettin' that 'caine 
 Half what I paid slippin' right through customs 
 It'll sell by night, its egg shell white 
 I got so many grams, if the man find out 
 It will land me in jail for life 
 But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese 
 With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy 
 We got bitches in the back of the truck 
 Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up! 
  
 [Chorus 2: Bun B] 
 We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese 
 We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s 
 We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T 
 It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N BHit ya ass on the celly, 'cause I ain't got time 
 To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready 
 Girl, why you never ready? For as long as you took 
 You better look like Halle Berry... Or Beyoncé 
 Shit, then we getting married 
 I brought sand to the beach 'cause my beach is better 
 You can keep ya beach 'cause that beach whatever 
 Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak 
 Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke 
 Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket 
 When it's gone I'm like "Fuck it" 
 I replace it with another one 
 Can't take this money with you 
 Burn this shit up like I'm Richard

 The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins? We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Oh God damn I'm shittin' gold these days 
  
 [Soulja Boy] 
 We made it 
 We made it 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Electronica] 
 The devil, the haters, the bloggers 
 The papers, the labels, they labeled me 
 But they can't relate to our struggle, my nigga 
 We came up from slavery 
 Apologies go out to all of my fans cause they waited so patiently 
 This one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me 
 A milli, a milli, niggas love me cause I'm ill 
 The greatest story ever told, niggas in the field 
 From Solomon to Sambo to Django, it's fact 
 I'm the Farrakhan of rap and I get it from the wheel 
 The son of WD, who hung around in the D 
 Who ran around in the three 
 The trap gods raised me 
 Face all on the Sphinx 
 Story all in the wall of the pyramids 
 Niggas know the Black God saved me 
 You can blow the nose off, that won't change it 
 Obamacare won't heal all that anguish 
 We came a long way from the bottom of the boat 
 All praise to the Mahdi, we found our language 
 Gold necklace, middle finger erected 
 God tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record 
 Lost sons of Muhammad, we wildin' in the wreckage 
 Asha du illah illaha is the message 
 All these niggas, I got to fight one 
 All these devils, I got to strike some 
 All these rebels just waitin' on the war cry 
 Mama said: "son, you got to strike drum" 
 Roc Nation, celebration 
 Motivation, elevation 
 Nigga we made it from slaves on a slaveship 
 Live from the cotton fields, straight to the spaceship 
  
 [Interlude: Kenny Powers] 
 Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 Hop off the slave ship 
 Popped off my chain and took it to Jacob, I got it gold plated 
 Walked in that bitch like "Nigga we made it!" 
 I own my own masters 
 You know I ain't missin' no royalty statements 
 I can't be rated (God, God), damn Hov stunt on them haters 
 Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk 
 Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought 
 While these rappers rap about guns they ain't shot 
 And a bunch of other silly shit that they ain't got 
 I'm on my Lupita Nyong'o 
 Stuntin' on stage, after 12 Years A Slave 
 This Ace of Spades look like an Oscar 
 Black tux, look like a mobster 
 Don't make me RRRRAA yah, nigga watch your tone 
 I come to court with black boxers on 
 Y'all hella jealous of my melatonin 
 I could black out at any given moment 
 I'm God, G is the seventh letter made 
 So when my arms and feet shackled I still get paid 
 All praises due 
 I'm ready to chase the Yakub back into caves 
 These are the last days, but do I seem fazed? 
 Showed up to the last supper in some brand new J's 
 I'm the true and livin', book of Hov 
 New religion, 8th wonder of the world, alien, superstition 
 You're blind, baby 
 Blind to the fact of who you are maybe 
 My bloodline's crazy 
 Kings and queens and Michael Jordan rings 
 I go estúpido, sucio 
 The flow is filthy, y'all can't kill me 
 I've been inoculated from the snakes and the fakes 
 And your corny handshakes, cock sucker we made it![Intro] 
 See what you made me do? 
  
 [Verse] 
 Shout out to old Jews and old rules 
 New blacks with new stacks 
 I already been the king 
 Retro act, I'm just bringing it back like Jordan Packs 
 New money, they looking down on me 
 Blue bloods they trying to clown on me 
 You can turn up your nose high society 
 Never gone turn down the homie 
 Knock knock I'm at your neighbor house 
 Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out 
 You should come to the housewarming 
 Come and see what your new neighbor 'bout (SKIRRRRR!) 
 Yellow Lambo in the driveway 
 A buck thirty-five, I'm on the highway 
 Frank Sinatra on my Sonos 
 Loud as fuck, I did it my way 
 A million sold before the album dropped 
 White Lexus before I had a deal 
 Ask Bun B about me 
 This ain't no snap back, a nigga been trill 
 By the way, fuck your mag 
 You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add 
 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million 
 Oh, I'm so good at math 
 Might crash ya Internet 
 And I ain't even into that 
 When I was talking Instagram 
 Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped 
 Feds still lurking 
 They see I'm still putting work in 
 Cause somewhere in America 
 Miley Cyrus is still twerkin' 
  
 [Outro] 
 Twerk, twerk (Miley, Miley) 
 Only in America[Chorus: Damian Marley and JAY-Z] 
 Now greetings to the world 
 Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Rude boy nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Too much watchy, watchy, watchy 
 Too much su, su, su, su, su 
 Them chatty, chatty, chatty 
 Them su, su, su, su, su 
 Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Shawn was on that gospel shit 
 I was on the total fuckin' opposite 
 Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer 
 That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off 
 Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures 
 So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya 
 I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins (ah!) 
 Those were just some words you'll never hear again (uh huh!) 
 For the final time you don't believe these fools 
 I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (never!) 
 I've never seen the runner with so many cars (never!) 
 Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are 
 My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas 
 Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga 
 Once upon a time in the projects 
 Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex 
 I was in fight mode and now it's "fuck me, mijo" 
 I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples 
 Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools 
 Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too 
 Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too 
 We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do 
 We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did 
 Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid 
 Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6" 
 Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget 
 Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin' 
 I pulled out the pot when we was outta options 
  
 [Chorus: Damian Marley and JAY-Z] 
 Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Rude boy nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Too much watchy, watchy, watchy 
 Them su, su, su, su, su 
 Too much chatty, chatty, chatty 
 And them su, su, su, su, su 
 Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Put that drum in your ear, don't get Srem'd 
 I'll Bobby Shmurda anybody you heard of 
 Niggas could not be further, I fathered your style 
 Birth of a Nation, Nat Turner style 
 Uh, y'all make me turn up all this talkin' down 
 Uh, niggas is skippin' leg-day just to run they mouth 
 I be skippin' leg day, I still run the world 
 I pressed ahead of your team with one finger curled 
 I'll line you all up with one finger wave 
 Make niggas weave, niggas is out here fake 
 Laced front to the back, don't front 
 Y'all gonna make me wig, I'ma give y'all what you want, uh 
  
 [Chorus: Damian Marley and JAY-Z] 
 Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Dreadlocks nuh live in a tenement yard 
 Too much watchy, watchy, watchy 
 And them su, su, su, su, su 
 Too much chatty, chatty, chatty 
 And them su, su, su, su, su 
 Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV 
  
 [Outro: Damian Marley] 
 Can't you see it's my ambition 
 I come to nice up the whole nation 
 What a bam bam yeah, Lord 
 And mi seh what a bam bam (Do it, Jay!) 
 Can't you see it's my ambition 
 I come to nice up the whole nation 
 What a bam bam, what a bam bam 
 I don't give a God damn, I don't give a God damn 
 When mi come a dance and mi spliff and Guinness 
 Yow, crowd of people–go and mind yuh business 
 This a hunting season, mek I tell you hunting season 
 Well, I tell ya something season, yow this a hunting season 
 Cake and dumpling season, spinners and dumpling season 
 Don't play by the king, love is all I and I bring you know 
 Voice of the one pon gully banking 
 Top ranking, keep it skanking 
 Ooh wee, huh, hear me now[Intro: Sizzla] 
 They can't keep a good man down 
 Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns 
 Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds 
 They will never ever take my crown 
 Who Jah bless I say no man curse 
 Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse 
 Here comes the officers askin' for a search 
 They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You in the presence of a king 
 Scratch that, you in the presence of a God 
 Put in the belly of the beast 
 I escaped, a nigga never had a job 
 Scott Boras, you over baby 
 Robinson Cano, you coming with me 
 These niggas like rotary phones 
 It's a new day, hit up KD 
 Niggas always try to knock a nigga down 
 Knock me to my knees about a million times 
 Uncle said I'll never sell a million records 
 I sold a million records like a million times 
 These niggas shouldn't let me in 
 I ball so hard on ESPN 
 See my name come across on CNN 
 'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again 
 'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again 
  
 [Hook: Travis Scott] 
 Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me 
 I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history 
 Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me 
 I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 If Fear is your only God 
 Get y'all to fear me is my only job 
 Crown, crown 
 Crown, crown 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope 
 Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk 
 Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say no? 
 You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T 
 You already know what I could do with the coke 
 Dropped it in the water, made it disappear 
 I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope 
 I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold 
 All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov 
 Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able 
 Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead 
 Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged 
  
 [Hook: Travis Scott] 
 Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me 
 I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history 
 Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me 
 I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history[Intro: Jay Z] 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh 
 You ready, B? 
 Let's go get 'em 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 Look for me! 
 Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway 
 Doin' what we like to do, our way 
 Eyes behind shades 
 This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates 
 But today I got my thoroughest girl with me 
 I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy 
 How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney 
 Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City 
 She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over 
 She's right back to being my soldier 
 ‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller 
 Put us together, how they gon' stop both us? 
 Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder 
 When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused 
 So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be 
 The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé] 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin' 
 With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin' 
 That ain't 'bout nothin' 
 If ever you mad about somethin' 
 It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that 
 I don't be at places where we comfy at 
 With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that 
 And no, I ain't perfect 
 Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is 
 But girlfriend, work with the kid 
 I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag 
 Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens 
 600 drops, Mercedes Benz 
 The only time you wear Burberry to swim 
 And I don't have to worry, only worry is him 
 She do anything necessary for him 
 And I do anything necessary for her 
 So don't let the necessary occur, yep! 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé] 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) 
  
 [Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)] 
 (Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend 
 I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you 
 Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!) 
 Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!) 
 Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be 
 And so I put this on my life 
 Nobody or nothing will ever come between us 
 And I promise I'll give my life 
 My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!) 
 Put this on my life 
 The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in 
 I promise I'll give my life 
 And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé] 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) 
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) 
 Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)[Intro: Reign Mosley, Jay-Z]

 Ready for that war, ready for that war, ready 
 You ain't ready yo, you radio, you ain't really ready 
 Real shit chyea, Alpo bought his bricks here 
 Elvis got his records took, it's like we got our seventh gear 
 NFL investigations, oh, don't make me laugh

 Not just in good times, that's that sucka shit 
 But in war times, it's just what it is 
 Head of the family, all my niggas bosses though 
 Y'all don't understand we? We talk that shit bosses know 
 Triple fuckin' OG, what's up to my nigga Juan 
 Tell these niggas pull their fuckin' skirt down, I could see their ovaries 
 Niggas snitching switching teams, out here telling bitches things 
 Industry talk behind your back, ain't nobody got time for that 
 Facts only, everything real in my raps only 
 Every nigga real in my clique really 
 Even the girls keep it two hundred and trilly

 El Padrino[Intro] 
 Just let me be great 
 Let me be great 
 I feel like mothafuckin' Cassius Clay right now 
 Genius! 
 Don't be good my nigga, be great 
 After that government cheese, we eating steak 
 After the projects, now we on estates 
 I'm from the bottom, I know you can relate 
  
 [Hook] 
 Fuck up the world 
 Just fuck up this world 
 Fuck up the world 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Me and destiny got a date 
 Martin had a dream, Hov got a team 
 My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring 
 Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur 
 Turn right in Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curb 
 See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens 
 I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime 
 1% of a billion more than niggas even seen 
 Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean 
  
 [Hook] 
 Fuck up this world 
 Fuck up the, uhh 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold 
 Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl 
 Came through Pasadena in the low-low 
 Just to show respect to the cholos 
 Feelin' like a stranger in my own land 
 Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland 
 I just want a shot to show my genius 
 Standing on the top hold my penis 
 America tried to emasculate the greats 
 Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes 
 Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble 
 Try to dim your lights tell you be humble 
 You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts 
 You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks 
 Sendin' light out to Compton and the hundred blocks 
 Lil bastard boy, basking on top 
  
 [Hook] 
 I fuck up this world 
 Just fuck up this world 
 Let's fuck up the world 
 Fuck up the, uhh 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sipping D'USSÉ boy this ain't your daddy yak 
 He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach 
 This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks 
 This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance 
 Socks is my synopsis is clear 
 Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear 
 Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to unteach ya 
 All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers 
 When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees 
 You front row everywhere, you in the H.O.V.'s 
 Jordan 1's and dungarees 
 And that's just the half of my warpath 
 Make a million another million let my niggas make a million 
 'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling 
 We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top 
 Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop 
  
 [Hook] 
 Just fuck up this world[Chorus] 
 The most amazing feeling I feel 
 Words can't describe the feeling, for real 
 Baby, I paint the sky blue 
 My greatest creation was you, you: Glory 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 False alarms and false starts 
 All made better by the sound of your heart 
 All the pain of the last time 
 I prayed so hard it was the last time 
 Your mama said that you danced for her 
 Did you wiggle your hands for her? 
 Glory! Glory! 
 Glory! Sorry 
 Everything that I prayed for 
 God's gift, I wish I woulda prayed more 
 God makes no mistakes, I made a few 
 Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through 
 I wreak havoc on the world 
 Get ready for part two 
 A younger, smarter, faster me 
 So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bey 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The most amazing feeling I feel 
 Words can't describe the feeling, for real 
 Baby, I paint the sky blue 
 My greatest creation was you, you: Glory 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Your Grandpop died of nigga failure 
 Then he died of liver failure 
 Deep down he was a good man 
 Goddamn, I can't deliver failure 
 Bad-ass lil Hov 
 Two years old, shopping on Savile Row 
 Wicked-ass lil B 
 Hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me 
 The most beautifulest thing in this world 
 Is daddy's little girl 
 You don't yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris 
 And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package 
 Last time the miscarriage was so tragic 
 We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voilà!) 
 So there you have it, shit happens 
 Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage 
 Everybody go through stuff 
 Life is a gift, love, open it up 
 You're a child of destiny 
 You're the child of my destiny 
 You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child 
 That's a hell of a recipe 
 Glory! Glory! 
 Glory! Sorry 
  
 [Chorus] 
 The most amazing feeling I feel 
 Words can't describe the feeling, for real 
 Baby, I paint the sky blue 
 My greatest creation was you, you: Glory

 [Intro] 
 "Ladies and gentlemen 
 Let's put our hands together for this dynasty! 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 Welcome ladies and gentlemen 
 To the 8th wonder of the world! 
 The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV! 
 Thanks for coming out tonight 
 You could've been anywhere in the world 
 But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA 
 Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins 
 Got it dirt cheap for them 
 Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them 
 Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them 
 Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy 
 Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me 
 Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy 
 Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in 
 But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 Not guilty, he who does not feel me 
 Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist 
 So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 Not guilty, y'all got to feel me 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I do this for my culture, to let them know 
 What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster 
 Show them how to move in a room full of vultures 
 Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over 
 Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up 
 I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush 
 Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us 
 We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks 
  
 [Chorus] 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 Not guilty, y'all got to feel me 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Hov is back, life stories told through rap 
 Niggas acting like I sold you crack 
 Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that 
 So hopefully you won't have to go through that 
 I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats 
 Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa 
 Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave 
 Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk 
 Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed? 
 Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law 
 So you know I seen it all before 
 I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight 
 To try and to fail: the two things I hate 
 Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy 
  
 [Chorus] 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 Not guilty, y'all got to feel me 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 [Outro] 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A 
 H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A[Intro] 
 “I work and work 'til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying 
 "She's getting old," and what do I get? A daughter 
 Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her 
 As she cares about ME!” 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Let's do this for these babies 
 Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres 
 Blatantly ballin' on HD 
 Y'all need to step up y'all AV 
 Life changed again I was already taking off 
 My flight changed again 
 Slight change of winds 
 It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again 
 Baby need Pampers 
 Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons 
 Please don't judge me, only hugged the block 
 I thought my daddy didn't love me 
 My baby getting chubby 
 Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely? 
 Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly 
 And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby 
 Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now 
 Just the thought alone fucks with me 
  
 [Hook] 
 High on life 
 I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor 
 Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter 
 If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest 
  
 [Interlude] 
 "Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo." 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I dream filthy (My mom and pops) 
 Mixed me with Jamaican (Rum and whiskey, what a set off) 
 And I know I'm not perfect baby 
 I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it 
 With some doctors and some nurses maybe 
 Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'Cedes 
 This relationship shit is complicated 
 All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it 
 I don't wanna duplicate it 
 I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy 
 And I got that nigga blood in me 
 I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me 
  
 [Hook] 
 High on life 
 I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor 
 Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter 
 If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest 
  
 [Interlude] 
 "No... wire... hangers... EVER!" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother 
 I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another 
 Baby with no daddy want no momma drama 
 I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer 
 Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower 
 And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us 
 For the beauty that you be Blue be 
 Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears 
 Cheer up, why can't you just be happy 
 Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy 
 Badly I just wanna spent more time with him 
 Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him 
 Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps 
 Cut the cord watch her take her first breath 
 And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared 
 But in life and death if I ain't here

 Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while 
 Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies 
 Hoping for the best but expecting the worst 
 Are you gonna drop the bomb or not? 
 Let us die young or let us live forever 
 We don't have the power but we never say never 
 Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip 
 The music's for the sad man 
  
 [Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)] 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young (young) 
 I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays) 
 Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows) 
 Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far) 
 Forever (ya know what I mean?) 
 Forever young 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 So we living life like a video (video) 
 Where the sun is always out and you never get old 
 And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good 
 And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood 
 And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car 
 Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow 
 Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime 
 And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind 
 So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine 
 Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind 
 Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time 
 So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine 
 I'm forever young 
  
 [Chorus: Mr. Hudson] 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young) 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive 
 Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky 
 Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's 
 Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive 
 Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots 
 My name shall be passed down to generations 
 While debating up in barbershops 
 Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here 
 With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah) 
 And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears 
 Young'll get younger every year, yeah 
 So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know 
 Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby 
  
 [Chorus: Mr. Hudson] 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Just let it run.. 
 Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches 
 Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up) 
 Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit 
 I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up) 
 I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit 
 And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit 
 Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in 
 Did you get the picture yet? 
 I'm painting you a portrait of Young

 Forever young, I wanna be forever young

 "I can't die, I can't die, I can't die" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 This shit is wicked on these mean streets 
 None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win 
 But then again, maybe it's for the best though 
 'Cause when they're sayin' too much 
 You know they're tryna get you touched 
 Whoever said illegal was the easy way out 
 Couldn't understand the mechanics 
 And the workings of the underworld, granted 
 Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive 
 I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot 
 Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills 
 I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti 
 That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it 
 Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends 
 I break bread with the late heads 
 Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do 
 It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us 
 And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

 [Verse 2] 
 We used to fight for building blocks 
 Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin' 
 The closest of friends when we first started 
 But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted 
 Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers 
 He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother 
 My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese 
 She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties 
 About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced 
 I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense 
 Who could ever foresee? 
 We used to stay up all night at slumber parties 
 Now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep 
 All the years we were real close 
 Now I see his fears through her tears 
 Know she's wishin' we were still close 
 Don't cry, it is to be; in time 
 I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

 My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed 
 By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses 
 The Exorcist got me doin' sticks 
 Like, "Homie, you don't know me 
 But the whole world owe me, strip!" 
 Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life 
 So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice 
 Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly 
 But now this higher learning got the Remy in me 
 Liquor's invaded my kidneys 
 Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me 
 I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo 
 Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true 
 Come test me, I never cower 
 For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers 
 Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die 
 And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

 [Intro] 
 Take the bass line out 
 Uh-huh, Jigga 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah 
 Let it bump though 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 From standin' on the corners, boppin' 
 To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen 
 From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard 
 From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock 
 Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well 
 From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell 
 But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw 
 Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots 
 And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not 
 I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not 
 Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot 
 Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh 
 Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh 
 And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy 
 Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby! 
 You know it's hell when I come through 
 The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2 
 Y'all niggas get ready! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I flow for those 'dro'ed out 
 All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house 
 We live in hard knocks 
 We don't take over, we borrow blocks 
 Burn 'em down and you can have it back 
 Daddy, I'd rather that 
 I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition 
 I see your vision, mama 
 I put my money on the longshots 
 All my ballers that's born to clock 
 Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not 
 I went from lukewarm to hot 
 Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size 
 Green machines, to green 5's 
 I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills 
 Then I put it down type Braille 
 I'm tight grill with the phony 
 Rappers, y'all might feel we homies 
 I'm like, "Still, y'all don't know me." 
 Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin' 
 I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life! 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes 
 Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes 
 Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress 
 You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me 
 I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out 
 Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out 
 So I stretched the game out, etched your name out 
 Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life![Produced by Irv Gotti] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella 
 We invite you to somethin' epic, you know? 
 Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness 
 Sort of a desperation 
 Through that desperation, we become addicted 
 Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin' 
 But we feel we have nothin' to lose 
 So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right? 
 What do you bring to the table? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely 
 My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me 
 I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be 
 Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet 
 I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days 
 A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away 
 My pain, wish it was quick to see 
 From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee 
 Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me 
 At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly 
 My squad and me lack of respect for authority 
 Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief 
 I know this game got valleys and peaks 
 Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly 
 The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in 
 No more Big Willie, my game has grown 
 Prefer you call me William 
 Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like 
 Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic 
 Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia 
 "I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure." 
 Lock my body, can't trap my mind 
 Easily explain why we adapt to crime 
 I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it 
 Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it 
 Presidential suites my residential for the weekend 
 Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin' 
 The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental 
 We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into? 
 Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables 
 Meet me by the one that starts a G up 
 This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up 
 And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas 
  
 [Hook] 
 Ge-ge-geyeahhh 
 Can I live? 
 Can I live? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle 
 Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you 
 Dual level like duplexes, in unity 
 My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity 
 You guessed it, manifest it 
 In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it 
 We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should 
 My confederation, dead a nation 
 Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient 
 When it boils to steam, it comes to it 
 We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this 
 True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish 
 Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders 
 I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist 
 Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream 
 "Let's do this," it gets tedious 
 So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

 Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth 
 (So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him 
 But he also got a righteous cause for sinning 
 Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first 
 Emergency, doctors performing procedures 
 Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but 
 "Vengeance is mine" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all 
 Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on 
 Respirators for killing my best boy, haters 
 On permanent hiatus as I skate 
 In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan 
 Pumping "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo 
 In Los Angeles, like an evangelist 
 I can introduce you to your maker 
 Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards 
 Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters 
 Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming

 Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water 
 Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic 
 All the static, shall cease to exist 
 Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six! 
 Spread love, to all of my dead thugs 
 I pour out a little Louis, to a head above 
 Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth 
 'til that time, it's on and popping, church 
 Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either 
 Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost 
 Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel 
 I let you see where that bright light lead you 
 The more you talk, the more you irking us 
 The more you gon' need memorial services 
 The Black Album, second verse, is like 
 Devil's pie, save some dessert for us 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Man, I gotta get my soul right 
 I gotta get these devils out my life 
 These cowards gonna make a nigga ride 
 They won't be happy 'til somebody die 
 Oh man, I gotta get my soul right 
 'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life 
 Every time it seems it's alright 
 Somebody want they soul to rise 
 I chase you off of this Earth 
 (Let me get serious for y'all, one second) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer 
 Asking him "why?" as my eyes fill up 
 These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow 
 Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya 
 So, curse the day that birthed the bastard 
 Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash 
 Reverse the blast then reverse the car 
 Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob 
 Lord forgive him, we all have sinned 
 But Bob's a good dude, please let him in 
 And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge 
 Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again[Intro: Frank Ocean]

 Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies 
 May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly 
 Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you 
 I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths 
 I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot 
 You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots 
 I wave to these haters, don't give me dap 
 You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh 
 Y'all body language is all remedial 
 How could you see the difference between you and I? 
 My crash course was much tougher 
 'Round friends who kill they friends 
 Then hug their friends' mothers 
 And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares 
 Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there 
 Memories may sneak down my cheek 
 But I could see a side-eye in my sleep 
  
 [Chorus: Frank Ocean] 
 Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void 
 Eyes open them up, check off the coins 
 Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you 
 I'm ready for earth, ready for real 
 Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there 
 So it seems, so you seem 
 I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare 
 In my dreams, in my dreams 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 I sat down with Prince, eye to eye 
 He told me his wishes before he died 
 Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind 
 They only see green from them purple eyes 
 They eyes hide, they eyes high 
 My eyes wide shut to all the lies 
 These industry niggas, they always been fishy 
 But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh 
 This guy had 'Slave' on his face 
 You think he wanted the masters with his masters? 
 You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house 
 I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket 
 Don't big bro me, don't "Big Homie" 
 I've seen pure admiration become rivals 
 I've been to Paris at least two times 
 I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful

 Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void 
 Eyes open them up, check off the coins

 Niggas make the same shit, me I make The Blueprint 
 Came in the Range, hopped out the Lexus 
 Every year since, I been on that next shit 
 Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes 
 Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records 
 Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner 
 Now I rock a tailored suit, lookin like a owner 
 No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown up 
 No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones

 Can't be scared to fail in the search of perfection 
 Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexin

 Fuck a throwback jersey cause we on to the next one 
 And fuck that Auto-Tune cause we onnnnn 
 And niggas don't be mad cause it's all about progression 
 Loiterers should be arrested 
 I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist 
 So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit 
 You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit 
 On to the next one, somebody call the waitress 
 Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do 
 I don't get dropped, I drop the label 
 World can't hold me, too much ambition 
 Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen 
 Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops 
 Meanin I'm on vacay, chillin on a big yacht 
 Yeah I got on flip-flops, white Louie boat shoes 
 Y'all should grow the fuck up, c'mere let me coach you 
 Hold up

 Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now 
 Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down 
 Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off 
 Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off 
 Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off 
 Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard 
 Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill 
 Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill 
 Can't chill but my neck will 
 Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal 
 Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets 
 Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects 
 Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps 
 Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best 
 M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text 
 Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next 
 Hold up 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Freeze, somebody bring me back some money please 
 I got a million ways to get it, choose one 
 Bring it back, now double your money and make it stack 
 I'm on to the next one, on to the next one 
 I'm on to the next one, on to the next one 
 I'm on to the next one, on to the next one 
 I'm on to the next one, on to the next one 
 Freeze, somebody bring me back some money please[Produced by Eminem and Luis Resto] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah 
 Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down 
 I'm in my zone 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity 
 This moment of honesty 
 The world'll feel my truths 
 All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse 
 I gave you Volume after Volume of my work 
 So you can feel my truths 
 I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out 
 Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt 
 Y'all can't fill my shoes 
 From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending 
 Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about 
 Nigga, feel my truths 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well 
 Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales 
 Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle 
 Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work 
 So a smirk was all on my face 
 Like, "Damn, that man's face is just like my face" 
 So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through 
 It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught 
 Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost 
 My big brothers and so many others I saw 
 I'm just glad we got to see each other 
 Talk and re-meet each other 
 Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity 
 This moment of honesty 
 The world'll feel my truths 
 All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse 
 I gave you Volume after Volume of my work 
 So you can feel my truths 
 I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out 
 Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt 
 Y'all can't fill my shoes 
 From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending 
 Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about 
 Nigga, feel my truths 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me 
 Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making 
 I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars 
 They criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla" 
 If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli 
 Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense 
 But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (wooo!) 
 When your cents got that much in common 
 And you been hustling since your inception 
 Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense 
 Since I know what I'm up against 
 We as rappers must decide what's most important 
 And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them 
 So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win 
 So next time you see the homie and his rims spin 
 Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity 
 This moment of honesty 
 The world'll feel my truths 
 All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse 
 I gave you Volume after Volume of my work 
 So you can feel my truths 
 I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out 
 Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt 
 Y'all can't fill my shoes 
 From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending 
 Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about 
 Nigga, feel my truths 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall 
 ‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off 
 See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball 
 'Til we all got triangles on our wall 
 Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record 
 I recall, ‘cause I really been there before 
 Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow 
 Prepared for war, I should fear no man 
 You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go 
 In one ear, out the other ear, no! 
 Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have 
 What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab 
 What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab 
 Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that 
 I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back 
 And the whole BK, nigga, holla back! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity 
 This moment of honesty 
 The world'll feel my truths 
 All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse 
 I gave you Volume after Volume of my work 
 So you can feel my truths 
 I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out 
 Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt 
 Y'all can't fill my shoes 
 From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending 
 Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about 
 Nigga, feel my truths[Intro] 
 Yeah, got a lil' cold 
 So bear with me 
 Yeah, yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We stuck in La La Land 
 Even when we win, we gon' lose 
 We got the same fuckin' flows 
 I don't know who is who 
 We got the same fuckin' watch 
 She don't got time to choose 
 We stuck in La La Land 
 We got the same fuckin' moves 
  
 [Post-Chorus] 
 Y'all fuck the same fuckin' chicks 
 I'm in the skrt with ya— yeah, right 
 I'm in the skrt with ya— cool story 
 I'm on the j— 'nough of this! 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Look, I know killers, you no killer, huh? 
 Bathing Ape maybe not a gorilla, huh? 
 Glorified seat filler, huh? 
 Stop walkin' around like y'all made Thriller, huh? 
 Fake Dracos all in the videos 
 We show 'em, we shoot 'em in my city though 
 I don't post no threats on the Internet 
 I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S for that 
 I don't be on the 'Gram goin' ham 
 Givin' information to the pork, that's all spam 
  
 [Pre-Chorus] 
 Please don't talk about guns that you ain't never gon' use 
 Y'all always tell on y'all self, I'm just so fuckin' confused 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Y'all stuck in La La Land 
 Even when we win, we gon' lose 
 We got the same fuckin' flows 
 I don't know who is who 
 We got the same fuckin' watch 
 She don't got time to choose 
 We stuck in La La Land 
 We got the same fuckin' moves 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Y'all niggas still signin' deals? Still? 
 After all they done stole, for real? 
 After what they done to our Lauryn Hill? 
 And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill? 
 That's real talk when you behind on your taxes 
 And you pawned all your chains 
 And they run off with your masters 
 And took it to Beverly Hills while we in Calabasas 
 And my head is scratchin' 'cause that shit is backwards 
 That shit ain't right, Lucian is cool 
 But Lucian don't write, Doug ain't this tight 
 So fuck what we sellin', fuck is we makin'? 
 'Cause their grass is greener 'cause they always rakin' in mo' 
  
 [Outro] 
 Na-na-na-na 
 Nah, nah[Intro] 
 Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant 
 The livest one representin' BK to the fullest 
 Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin' 
 Chicken-heads be cluckin' 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen 
 And Jam Master Jay was alive I-I, I was mixin' 
 Cookin' coke in the kitchen 
 Back when Rodman was a Piston 
 Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one 
 Gave birth to my verbal imagination 
 Assume a virtue if you have not 
 Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet 
 "Lord, we know who we are 
 Yet we know not what we may be" 
 So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy 
 I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand 
 Back when Pam was on Martin 
 Yeah, that's where it all started 
 When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a… nine millimeter 
 When Slick Rick made "Mona Lisa" 
 When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all 
 Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah 
 Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts 
 There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort 
 Marcy me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Marcy me 
 Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence 
 I'm the Gotham City heartbeat 
 I, started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis 
 I'ma, Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi 
 That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past 
 Came through the bushes smellin' like roses 
 I need a trophy just for that 
 Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof 
 Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh 
 Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke 
 Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope 
 Shout out to all the murderers turned murals 
 Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau 
 Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle 
 All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile 
 Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes 
 Thus concludin' my concerto 
 Marcy me 
  
 [Outro: The-Dream] 
 Must be in the air 
 Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know 
 Just the way I'm raised 
 I know, I know, I know 
 Oh Marcy, Marcy me 
 Just the way I am always gonna be 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 Couldn't change me if I wanted to 
 You couldn't change me if you wanted to 
 I'ma take this with me to the Moon 
 (Como hás nome, cavaleiro? 
 Eu hei nome Todo o Mundo 
 E meu tempo…)[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 It's not a diss song, it's just a real song 
 Uh, you feel me? Uh 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov 
 Made Hov say, "Okay, so, make another Hov!" 
 Niggas wasn't playin' they day role 
 So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo 
 I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though 
 I put friends over business end of the day though 
 But when friends' business interests is Day Glow 
 Ain't nothin' left to say though 
 I guess we forgot what we came fo' 
 Shoulda stayed in food and beverage 
 Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein 
 I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them 
 Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him 
 And I ain't even want to be famous 
 Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes 
 And I ain't even know how it came to this 
 Except that fame is the worst drug known to man 
 It's stronger than, heroin 
 When you could look in the mirror like, "There I am" 
 And still not see what you've become 
 I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one 
  
 [Hook: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z] 
 Lose, one, let go to get one 
 Get, one, lose some to win some (you lost one) 
 Story of a champion 
 Sorry, I'm a champion 
 You lost one 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I don't think it's meant to be, B 
 For she loves her work more than she does me 
 And honestly, at twenty-three 
 I would probably love my work more than I did she 
 So, we ain't we, it's me and her 
 'Cause what she prefers over me is work 
 And that's where we differ 
 So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts 
 So, breathe, mami, it's deserved 
 You've been put on this Earth 
 To be all you can be like the Reserves 
 And me? My time in the army, it's served 
 So I have to allow she her time to serve 
 The time's now for her, in time she'll mature 
 And maybe we can be we again like we were 
 Finally, my time's too short to share 
 And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one 
  
 [Hook:  Chrisette Michele & Jay-Z] 
 Lose, one, let go to get one 
 Get, one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one) 
 Story of a champion 
 Sorry I'm a champion 
 You lost one 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 My nephew died in the car I bought 
 So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault 
 Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought 
 Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord 
 But time don't go back, it goes forward 
 Can't run from the pain, go towards it 
 Some things can't be explained, what caused it? 
 Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit! 
 Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it 
 'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous 
 Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift 
 Almost lost my faith, that restored it 
 It's like havin' your life restarted 
 Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it 
 So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift 
 To return, when I lost you, I lost it 
  
 [Hook: Chrisette Michele & Jay-Z] 
 Lose, one, let go to get one 
 Get, one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)

 Presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for dead ******' presidents to represent me (whose...) 
  
 [Intro throughout Chorus] 
 Rock.. on, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 The saga continues.. (what the fuck?) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce 
 Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras 
 To the death of us: me and my confidants, we shine 
 You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme 
 By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow 
 We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me? 
 Factions from the other side would love to kill me 
 Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat 
 Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life 
 In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life 
 Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up 
 On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up 
 I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback 
 Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back 
 That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me" 
 I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully 
 Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process 
 And I ain't got nothin' but time 
 I had near brushes, not to mention, three shots 
 Close range, never touched me: divine intervention 
 Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty 
 Down in Nevada, ha ha, poppa, word life 
 I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight 
 Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88... what? 
  
 [Chorus: Nas sample] 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for dead ******' presidents to represent me (whose...) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Geyeah, know what? I'll make.. 
 You and your wack mans fold like bad hands 
 Roll like Monopoly: advance 
 You're coppin' me like white crystal 
 I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to 
 The dead presidential candidate 
 With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you 
 In due time when crime flees my mind 
 All sneak thieves and player haters can shine 
 But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant 
 I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in 
 Long as the villain win 
 I spend Japan yen, attend major events 
 Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin' 
 J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin' 
 I got a good life, man, pounds and pence 
 'nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench 
 Catch me swingin' for the fence 
 Dead Presidents, ya know? Uh-huh 
  
 [Chorus: Nas sample] 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!) 
 I'm out for dead ******' presidents to represent me (whose...) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Ha ha (... ha ha) yeah, yeah, so be it 
 The Soviet, the Unified steady flow 
 You already know: you light, I'm heavy, roll heavy dough 
 Mic-macheted your flow, your paper falls slow like confetti 
 Mine's a steady grow, perico 
 Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show 
 My dough flip like Tae-Kwon 
 Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom 
 Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners 
 Heavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella 
 Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected 
 From chips to chicks to strippin' a Lexus 
 Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung 
 We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done 
 Crime family, well-connected, Jay-Z 
 And you, fake thugs is unplugged like MTV 
 I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure 
 Dead presidentials, politics as usu-al—BLAOW!

 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it 
 X came through, caught lighter fluid 
 Still I came through it; clap for him! 
 But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em 
 I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it 
 Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it 
 Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him 
 If he keep going, pass the torch to him 
 50 came through like hurricanes do 
 I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too 
 I had the Illmatic on bootleg 
 The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead 
 Wayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli 
 Ye too, but what Em did was silly 
 The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him 
 His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome; applaud him!

 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down 
 The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town 
 Luda moved digits after he moved bitches 
 Drake's up next, see what he do with it 
 Rule had a run, couple movie parts 
 T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts 
 What up, Jeezy? What it do? 
 Y’all remind me of us in early '92 
 Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill 
 Like a male version of Lauryn Hill 
 Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it 
 A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn 
 Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate 
 Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape 
 Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface 
 They had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy

 And I am one of one 
 Can’t you see just how long my run? 
 My reign, Lulu's son-shine 
 Been a star since I was duckin' one time 
 One time, give it up for him 
 December 4th, a star was born 
 Clap for him! He went from moving that corner 
 To this corner office, it's so enormous 
 Hey, Pres Carter 
 Watch them get they Monica on all day 
 Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay 
 They come, they go, some real, some faux 
 Some friends, some hoes 
 But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

 [Verse 4: J. Cole] 
 And could I be a star? 
 Does fame in this game have to change who you are? 
 Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life 
 Just to make it in these Broadway lights? 
 Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure 
 A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville 
 Got a deal, a real life saver 
 Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada 
 I chill now, cop a little ice later 
 Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber 
 So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform 
 Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him 
 No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders 
 Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches 
 Told you I’m focused, man 
 I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em!

 [Intro] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
 You're far too kind 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more? 
 Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 Now what the hell are you waitin' for? 
 After me, there shall be no more 
 So for one last time, nigga, make some noise! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that 
 The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at 
 Can't none of y'all mirror me back 
 Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime 
 I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead 
 Back to take over the globe, now break bread 
 I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express 
 Out the country, but the blueberry still connect 
 On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck 
 But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep 
 Grand openin', grand closin' 
 Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again 
 Who you gon' find doper than him? 
 With no pen, just draw off inspiration 
 Soon you gonna see you can't replace him 
 With cheap imitations for these generations 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more? 
 Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 Now what the hell are you waitin' for? 
 After me, there shall be no more 
 So for one last time, nigga, make some noise! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you! 
 Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you 
 When you first come in the game, they try to play you 
 Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you 
 From Marcy to Madison Square 
 To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah) 
 As fate would have it, Jay's status appears 
 To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye 
 When I come back like Jordan 
 Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you 
 It's to aim at you, probably maim you 
 If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens 
 Cocksucker, take one for your team! 
 And I need you to remember one thing (one thing) 
 I came, I saw, I conquered 
 From record sales to sold-out concerts 
 So, motherfucker, if you want this encore 
 I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Owww, it's star time 
 This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys 
 Do y'all want more of the Jigga man? 
 Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man 
 Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage 
 Say "Hova!" – c'mon, say it! 
 Are y'all out there? [crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"] 
 C'mon, louder! 
 Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about 
 They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga! 
  
 [Break] 
 I like the way this one feel 
 It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man! 
 (Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh) 
 Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So this here is the victory lap 
 Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back 
 After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2 
 And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two 
 You wanted to gain attention, new dudes 
 I can get you BET – and TRL, too 
 You want to be in the public, send your budget 
 Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin' 
 Young did it to death, you gotta love it 
 Record companies told me I couldn't cut it 
 Now look at me: all star-studded 
 Golfer above par like I putted 
 All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous 
 How sick is this? 
 You want to bang, send Kanye change 
 Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip 
 Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

 "I had my own little business on the side, a sort of sideline... a rather confidential sort of thing... but you might make a nice bit of money." 
  
 [Hook] 
 Hundred dollar bills 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Benjamin Franklins filled, fold it just for the thrill 
 Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill 
 Stock markets just crash, now I'm just a bill 
 History don't repeat itself, it rhymes, 1929, still 
 Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, I park things 
 Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick, still tip 
 On four-four's (Who?) Four-four's at the 4-0 (Wait) for O 
 Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin 
 Politicians all move for money, what the hell are we calling 'em? 
 Low life, I'm crawling out, 911, I Porsched it out 
 Y'all niggas all hypocrites, y'all know what this shit is all about 
 Hunnid, dolla, hunnid dolla bill, real, uh 
  
 [Interlude: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joel Edgerton] 
 "Her voice is full of money." 
 "He's a crook, George. He throws those parties the papers are always talking about." 
 "I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody." 
 "We were born different. It's in our blood." 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 New heroines, new Marilyns, move coke through Maryland 
 Through Easton, oh, you beasting 
 Move fat packs, Jack Gleason 
 The honeymoon's over with the streets shit 
 Least see my kids on the weekend 
 Carter, new Kennedy 
 No ordinary Joe, you'll remember me 
 No prohibition for my coalition 
 Colin Powell, general admission 
 You're all welcome, new Malcolm, of the talcum 
 "By any means," AK lookin' out the window screen 
 "Let's Get It On," new Marvin 
 Who wanna become my 100th problem? 
 Semi-automatic or revolver, semi-automatic I'll solve em 
 Einstein, my mind, this MC move white squares with my relatives 
 That cheese made us constipated couldn't tell us shit 
 Took that Taylor Swift to a hundred fucking million, bitch 
 I'mma let y'all continue but... ha-ha... 
  
 [Interlude: Leonardo DiCaprio & Tobey Maguire] 
 "It's called greed, old sport." 
 "That's right!" 
 "Who is he anyhow, an actor?" 
 “Meyer? No, he’s a gambler. He’s the man who fixed the 1919 World’s Series." 
 "Fixed it?" 
 "Fixed it." 
 "Well, how'd he manage that?" 
 "Oh... saw the opportunity, I suppose." 
  
 [Outro] 
 I need a hunnid bricks on them hunnid blocks 
 I got a hunnid drops, took a hunnid cops, uh 
 A hunnid blocks, I need a hunnid bricks on them hunnid blocks, uh 
 Decade of decadence, ill reverence, irreverence 
 Decade of decadence, ill reverence, irreverence 
 Uh, young, uh 
 I need a hunnid bricks on them hunnid blocks 
 I got a hunnid, I got a hunnid drops 
 Need a hunnid, got a hunnid 
 Got a hunnid, hunnid, uh 
 Hunnid, dolla, bill, real[Hook: Gonjasufi] 
 Nickels and dimes 
 Sticks to my mind 
 I want more than 
 You have my friends 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes 
 MAC-11, I squeeze like lemon limes 
 Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines 
 'tween beauty and beast, I walk the line 
 Johnny Cash, I'm a real G 
 I cut myself today to see if I still bleed 
 Success is so sublime 
 Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind 
 Something 'bout the struggle so divine 
 This sort of love is hard to define 
 When you scratching for every nickel and dime 
 Got me itching to do this shit for my mom 
 Do this shit for my town 
 Leave the door open hoping they kick it down 
 The purest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous 
 We gon' make it there, I promise this 
  
 [Hook: Gonjasufi] 
 Nickels and dimes 
 Sticks to my mind 
 I want more than 
 You have my friends 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Sometimes I feel survivor's guilt 
 I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell 
 Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell 
 Did I do it for him or do it for myself 
 Can't lie to myself 
 I love my niggas more than my own blood 
 I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up 
 I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route 
 I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now 
 No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out 
 No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason 
 Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth 
 That'll drive me gaga 
 Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime 
 Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down 
 I'm just trying to find common ground 
 'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down 
 Mr. Day O, major fail 
 Respect these youngins boy, it's my time now 
 Hublot homie, two door homie 
 You don't know all the shit I do for the homies 
  
 [Hook: Gonjasufi] 
 Nickels and dimes 
 Sticks to my mind 
 I want more than 
 You have my friends 
  
 [Bridge: Gonjasufi] 
 It all depends 
 How the story is 
 Nickels and dimes 
 Tickle my mind 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Pardon my hubris, Stanley Kubrick 
 With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks 
 Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters 
 Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water 
 And just for clarity, my presence is charity 
 My flow is a gift, philanthropist 
 Everybody 'round me rich, or will be 
 Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me 
 And when a nigga go as the old adage go 
 You die rich and you die disgraced, so just let me grow 
 Watch me cook, throw no looks 
 Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked, yeah 
 Y'all not worthy, sometimes I feel like 
 Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly 
 The greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous 
 So here y'all go, I promise this 
  
 [Hook: Gonjasufi] 
 Nickels and dimes

 I want more than

 I'm a pimp by blood, not relation 
 Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh? 
 Drunk off Cris', mami on E 
 Can't keep her little model hands off me 
 Both in the club, high, singing off key 
 "And I wish I never met her at all!" 
 It gets better, ordered another round 
 It's, about, to go, down 
 Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris' 
 Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere 
 What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh) 
 Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion? 
 Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (okay) 
 Filth Mart jeans, take that off

 Yeah, save the narrative, you saving it for marriage 
 Let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats 
 You wanna see how far I'ma go 
 How, much I'ma spend but you already know 
 Zip, zero, stingy with dinero 
 Might buy you Cris', but that about it 
 Might light your wrist, but that about it 
 Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips 
 Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick 
 Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless 
 Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down 
 Get you bling like the Neptune sound 
 Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold 
 Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul 
 Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies 
 I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me (c'mon)

 Why don't you try me 
 Baby you want to, believe me (Hov'!)

 [Intro] 
 Turn my music high, high, high, high-er! 
 (You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing) 
 Sure I do! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em 
 And bullets'll follow 'em 
 And there's so much coke that you could run the slalom 
 And cops comb this shit top to bottom 
 And say that we are prone to violence 
 But it's home sweet home 
 Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome 
 The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes 
 But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown 
 All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone 
 Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell 
 But when them shells come, you better return 'em 
 All scars, we earn 'em 
 All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand 
 We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans 
 Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan 
 This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it 
 Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous 
 For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I—am—Hov! 
 (You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing) 
 Sure I do! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I tell you the difference between me and them 
 They tryin' to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's 
 One million, two million, three million, four 
 In just five years, forty million more 
 You are now lookin' at the forty million boy 
 I'm rapin' Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man 
  
 [Interlude] 
 R—O—C 
 (You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing) 
 That's where you're wrong 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I came into this motherfucker a hundred grand strong 
 Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs 
 Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back 
 Could make 40 off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that 
 And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothing 
 Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind 
 That's another difference that's between me and them 
 I smarten up, open the market up 
 One million, two million, three million, four 
 In eighteen months, eighty million more 
 Now add that number up with the one I said before 
 You are now lookin' at one smart black boy 
 Momma ain't raised no fool 
 Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Motherfucker, I—will—not—lose 
 (You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing) 
 Put somethin' on it! 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell 
 I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale 
 I was born to get cake, move on and switch states 
 Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates 
 Was born to dictate, never follow orders 
 Dickface, get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay 
  
 [Outro]

 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up 
 Somebody got a problem with Hov 
 What's up? You niggas all fed up ‘cause I got a little cheddar 
 And my record's movin' out the store? 
 Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me 
 My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly 
 "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" – gotta move carefully 
 ‘Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes 
 Youngins ice-grillin' me — oh, you not feelin' me? 
 Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind 
 Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin' 
 Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs 
 Damn, little mans, I'm just tryin' do me 
 If the record's two mil I'm just tryin' move three 
 Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E 
 Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage 
 I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car 
 Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers 
 Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all 
 I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing 
 Where's the love? 
  
 [Hook: Bobby Bland + Jay Z] 
 Ain't no love in the heart of the city 
 I said, where's the love? 
 Ain't no love in the heart of town 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 And then the Fugees gonna break up 
 Now everyday I wake up, somebody got somethin' to say 
 What's all the fuckin' fussin' for? 
 Because I'm grubbin' more and I pack heat like I'm the oven door? 
 Niggas pray and pray on my downfall 
 But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball 
 Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys 
 Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar 
 Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after 
 I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya 
 I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper 
 Can I live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit 
 And I did handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his 
 Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam 
 Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love? 
  
 [Hook: Bobby Bland + Jay Z] 
 Ain't no love in the heart of the city 
 I said, where's the love? 
 Ain't no love in the heart of town 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Z] 
 Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up 
 And Ike and Tina Turner break up 
 Then I wake up to more bullshit 
 You knew me before records, you never disrespected me 
 Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit 
 Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss 
 Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all 
 Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait 
 What, you mad ‘cause you push dimes and he sell weight? 
 Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates 
 Hehehe, and more baggies — why you all aggie? 
 Nigga, respect the game, that should be it 
 What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?

 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ayo, peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh) 
 The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh) 
 I got vendettas in dice games against ass bettors (uh-huh) 
 And niggas who pump wheels and drive Jettas 
 Take that with ya 
  
 [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Jay-Z] 
 Hit ya, back split ya (uh) 
 Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles (uh) 
 Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle (woo) 
 Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle (mhm) 
 Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated 
 Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug-related (haha) 
 Most hated 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G] 
 Can't fade it (uh, what?) 
 While y'all pump Willie, I run up and stunt silly (uh-huh) 
 Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me (uh) 
 But on the con-trilli, I packs the MAC-milli 
 Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin' soft on him 
 "What's ya name?" 
  
 [Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.] 
 Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra (uh) 
 Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet 
 Tryin' to push 700s, they ain't made them yet 
 Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too 
 Niggas 'round the way call me Igloo, stick WHO? 
 Motherfucker!

 Keep rockin', yeah 
 No more mister nice guy, I twist your shit 
 The fuck back with the pistols blazin' 
 Hot like Cajun (uh) 
 Hotter than even holdin' work at the Days Inn 
 With New York plates outside 
 Get up out of there! Fuck the ride!

 Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper (uh!) 
 Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White! 
 Leave the keys to your InnKeeper (That's right) 
 Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me 
 You're holdin' more drugs than a pharmacy 
 You ain't harmin' me, so pardon me 
 Pass the safe, before I blaze the place 
 And here's six shots just in case

 Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough 
 And even worse, if I was broke would you want me 
 If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings 
 Bitches kill for would you still roll 
 If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand 
 Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving 
 If I wasn't a, eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga 
 Would you come around me or would you clown me 
 If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya 
 Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya 
 See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five 
 Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or 
 Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up 
 Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya 
 If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low 
 Baby girl, if this is so, yo 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z & Amil] 
 Can I get a fuck you 
 To these bitches from all of my niggas 
 Who don't love hoes, they get no dough 
 Can I get a woop woop

 Who don't got love for niggas without dubs 
 Can I get a fuck you 
 To these bitches from all of my niggas 
 Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

 You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that 
 How we gonna get around on your bus pass 
 Before I put this pussy on your mustache 
 Can you afford me? My niggas breadwinners, never corny 
 Ambition makes me so horny 
 Not the fussin' and the frontin' 
 If you got nothing, baby boy, you better 
 Get up, get out and get some, shit 
 I like a - lot of Prada, Alizé and vodka 
 Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up 
 Get it up I put it down e'rytime it pop up, huh 
 I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya 
 Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock 
 I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa 
 My - coochie remains in a Gucci name 
 Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance 
 High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass 
 If you ain't holdin' I dash yo 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z & Amil] 
 Can I get a fuck you

 Who don't got love for niggas without dubs 
 Can I get a fuck you 
 To these bitches from all of my niggas 
 Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

 [Verse 3: Ja Rule] 
 It ain't even a question 
 How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes 
 Like my puss wet like damp clothes 
 What y'all niggas don't know: it's e-asy to pimp a hoe 
 Bitches better have my money fo' sho' 
 Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how 
 I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out 
 I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred 
 Makin' 'em feel, slutted even if they don't want it 
 It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm 
 Dead wrong, when I tell 'em, "be gone" 
 So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num 
 'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the i-con 
 With hoodies and Timbs on, 'cause I thugs my bitches 
 VV studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggas 
 I'm talkin' 'bout straight figures, if you here, you with us 
 If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z & Amil] 
 Can I get a fuck you

 To these niggas from all of my bitches 
 Who don't got love for niggas without dubs

 Hehehe, hehehe, for real 
  
 [Chorus: Biz Markie + JAY-Z] 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls 
 Girls, I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at you when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam 
 So she call me "cabron" plus "maricon" 
 Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home 
 I'm like, "Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo" 
 I got this black chick, she don't know how to act 
 Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap 
 She like: "Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap 
 You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me" 
 I got this French chick that love to French kiss 
 She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist 
 "Ma cherie amour, tu es belle" 
 Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell 
 I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her 
 Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather 
 She said: "all you need to know is I'm not a ho 
 And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough" 
 Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black 
 That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat 
 Arroz con pollo, French fries and crepe 
 An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate 
 I love 
  
 [Chorus: Q-Tip + JAY-Z] 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls, uh-huh 
 Girls, I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls 
 Girls all over the globe 
 I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros 
 Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 I got this young chick, she so immature 
 She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more 
 Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor 
 Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla 
 Got a project chick that plays her part 
 And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart 
 Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start 
 Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts 
 I got this model chick that don't cook or clean 
 But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean 
 Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene 
 God damn she's fine but she parties all the time! 
 I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick 
 She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick 
 She gives me extra pillows and seat back love 
 So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club 
 Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model 
 That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo 
 That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef 
 But I never have a problem with my first class seat 
  
 [Chorus: Slick Rick + JAY-Z] 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls 
 Girls, I do adore

 Girls all over the globe 
 I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros 
 Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house 
 A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out 
 Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru 
 She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through 
 Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit 
 Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets 
 Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick 
 'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man 
 I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull 
 She like, "Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?" 
 I'm like, "Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass 
 You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half" 
 I got this ho that after 12 million sold 
 Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov' 
 Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow 
 I've got so many girls across the globe 
  
 [Outro: JAY-Z + (Biz, Tip, Rick)]

 [Chorus: Nas Sample] 
 Presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
  
 [Intro] 
 Rock.. on, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 While others spit that Wonderama shit 
 Me and my conglomerate 
 Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit 
 Live out my dreams until my heart give out 
 Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about 
 Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out 
 Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt 
 My life ain't rosy but I roll with it 
 My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it 
 And told me that the Mo' did it 
 And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic 
 I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches 
 Watch how I'm walkin' 
 'Cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in 
 Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned 
 Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles 
 And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil 
 Thoughts that this sport'll feed you 
 Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a 
 Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that? 
 Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee 
 Rappers goin' broke tryin' to keep up with me 
 My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder 
 You know this nigga: Jay-Z, Shawn Carter 
 G.S. the fuck up, dree-ess the fuck up 
 Watch me shine like a Breitling, Breguets the fuck up 
 All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's 
 Small timers, I said it, I'm addressin' all drama 
 Talk to me! 
  
 [Chorus: Nas sample] 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!) 
 I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 So sick of niggas 
 "I want money like Cosby" – who wouldn't? 
 This the kinda talk 
 That make me think you probably ain't got no puddin' 
 Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail 
 You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail 
 Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail 
 Niggas'll, roast a L but, scared to throw your toast, well 
 I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell 
 There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas 
 One day you're cruisin' in your 7 
 Next day you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies 
 Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up 
 Hit with the RICO, they repo your veh-i-cle 
 Everything was all good just a week ago 
 'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you? 
 Ready to start snitchin', ain't you? 
 I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you 
 Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake they ass at bars 
 You know you wouldn't be involved 
 With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers 
 East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers 
 Little monkey niggas turn gorillas 
 Stopped in the station, filled up on octane 
 And now they not sane and not playin', that goes without sayin' 
 Slayin' day in and day out 
 When money play in, then they play you out 
 Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy 
 Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know? 
  
 [Bridge: Nas sample] 
 Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
 Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
 Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...) 
 Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)

 ("JAY-Z won't hold my hand no more.") 
 "JAY-Z this," "JAY-Z that." 
 "JAY-Z that," "JAY-Z this." 
 ("JAY-Z won't give me no money.") 
 Get off JAY-Z' dick! 
 What, y'all niggas get front page articles? 
 Y'all mention JAY-Z name? 
 (This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z 
 (Check) In JAY-Z news 
 I understand what y'all tryin' to do 
 I brought the flutes this time, though (Check) 
 Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru 
 Give me some more music in the headphone 
 Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening 
 Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time) 
 C'mon! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave 
 Naw, naw, don't be afraid, y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay 
 Y'all from afar threw darts my way 
 What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope! 
 Y'all fell into the booby trap 
 I set the trap just to see dude react 
 And now, and now you's can't leave 
 You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually 
 And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez 
 I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is 
 But you can't give cred to anything dude says 
 Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head 
 Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead 
 You sound a little naive in them articles that I read 
  
 [Hook] 
 H, O, V, A, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way 
 H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave 
 H, O, V, A, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way 
 H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes 
 Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes 
 Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes 
 And this is with whom you want to place your faith 
 I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine 
 When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line 
 Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold 
 When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no? 
 Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself? 
 Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help 
 They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude 
 To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects 
 These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks 
 They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip 
 And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype 
 'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright 
 'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice 
 It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write 
 Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic? 
 Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice? 
 I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit 
 Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat 
 But I will not lose, for even in defeat 
 There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me 
 When the grass is cut, the snakes will show 
 I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though 
 Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes 
 And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa 
 I'm back before you had a chance to miss me 
 My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history 
 Who you know flow vicious as me? 
 Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov' 
 I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga!) 
 You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be 
 You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me 
 I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee 
 I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me 
 You should be happy to be in my presence 
 I should charge you a fee 
 I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob – listen, God, you a flea 
 And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me 
 What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me, nigga 
 Hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga 
 That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga 
 I won't rest 'til you on one knee 
 You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga 
 Until you on one knee 
 You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga

 [Intro] 
 You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest (Jigga) 
 Turn the music up in the headphones (Jigga) 
 Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga 
 I got you, yeah, uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you feeling like a pimp 
 Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
 Get that dirt off your shoulder 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force 
 Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche 
 Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced 
 Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls 
 Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin' 
 All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin' 
 All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin' 
 But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it 
 Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops 
 Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block 
 Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block 
 I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you feeling like a pimp 
 Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
 Get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda 
 I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover 
 Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir 
 Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya 
 But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin' 
 Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em 
 Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin' 
 In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin' 
 With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve 
 At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen 
 I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean 
 No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you feeling like a pimp 
 Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
 Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map 
 Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach 
 I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap 
 I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black 
 I drop that Black Album, then I back out it 
 As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me 
 From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's 
 From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie 
 You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day 
 I'm like a young Marvin in his hey' 
 I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony 
 Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 If you feeling like a pimp 
 Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
 Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder 
 You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

 [Intro: Russell Crowe from Gladiator] 
 "Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?" 
 "Is this not why you are here?" 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 Turn the music up, turn me down 
 Guru, let's go get 'em again 
 This time it's for the money my nigga 
 Brooklyn, stand up 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 There's never been a nigga this good for this long 
 This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong 
 With so many different flows, this one's for this song 
 The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up 
 These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy 
 They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me 
 You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked 
 Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome 
 I'm like, "TAA!" 
 I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others 
 I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother 
 Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it 
 I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish 
 So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out 
 It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth 
 I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas 
 What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you: 
 W-I, double-L, I-E 
 Nobody truer than H-O-V 
 And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador 
 Prime Minister, back to finish my business up 
  
 [Chorus: Hum-V] 
 What more can I say? 
 What more can I do? 
 I gave this up to you 
 I know this much is true, true, true 
 My love 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z] 
 What more can I say to you? You heard it all 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down South 
 Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought 
 Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt 
 But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name 
 Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful 
 Even if they patrol, I make payroll 
 Benz paid for, friends they roll 
 Private jets down to Turks and Caicos 
 Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit 
 Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go 
 By without me bein' fly, fresh to death 
 Head to toe 'til the day I rest 
 And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus 
 Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups 
 S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete 
 What more can I say? Guru, play the beat! 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)] 
 My nigga, hahahaha, woo! 
 We gon' let this ride into the hook 
 - I'ma snap my fingers on this one 
 What more can I say to you? 
 - Get my grown man on 
 LET'S GO! 
 (What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag 
 For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White 
 That mean that shit you write must be illy 
 Either that or your flow is silly, it's both! 
 I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag 
 Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass 
 The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish 
 Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it 
 And no I'm not through with it 
 In fact, I'm just previewin' it 
 This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it 
 One-two and I won't stop abusin' it 
 To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it 
 Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent 
 Niggas got a problem, Houston! 
 What up B, they can't shut up me 
 Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride 
 God forgive me for my brash delivery 
 But I remember vividly what these streets did to me 
 So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me 
 Paint me like a pickany 
 I will literally kiss TT in the forehead 
 Tell her, "Please forgive me," then squeeze into your forehead 
 I'm not the one to score points off, in fact 
 I got a joint that'll knock your points off 
 Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me 
 I'm at the Trump International, ask for me 
 I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there 
 And nigga, why would I ever care? 
 Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here 
 Excludin' nobody, look what I embody: 
 The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street 
 A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me 
 And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times 
 Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines 
 And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes 
 But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines 
 Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times 
 Times that by my influence on pop culture 
 I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list 
 We'll see what happens when I no longer exist 
 Fuck this man! 
  
 [Outro: Hum-V] 
 What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?[Intro: Blue Ivy Carter] 
 Daddy, what's a will? 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Take those monies and spread 'cross families 
 My sisters, Hattie and Lou, the nephews, cousins and TT 
 Eric, the rest to B for whatever she wants to do 
 She might start an institute, she might put poor kids through school 
 My stake in Roc Nation should go to you 
 Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too 
 TIDAL, the champagne, D'USSÉ, I'd like to see 
 A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we 
 We gon' start a society within a society 
 That's major, just like the Negro League 
 There was a time America wouldn't let us ball 
 Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech 
 Generational wealth, that's the key 
 My parents ain't have shit, so that shift started with me 
 My mom took her money, she bought me bonds 
 That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z] 
 Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy 
 Black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see 
 Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy 
 Black excellency, baby, let 'em see

 I remember, like, listenin' to Wu-Tang 
 And niggas like, "Your seed married his seed, married my seed" 
 That's how we keep Carter money all in the family 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 You see, my father, son of a preacher man 
 Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand 
 That charge of energy set all the Carters back 
 It took all these years to get to zero in fact 
 I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian 
 He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday 
 Someday I forgive him 
 'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions 
 I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians 
 And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom 
 See how the universe works? 
 It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself 
 It's a gift and a curse 
 That's called the Red Queen's Race 
  
 [Bridge: JAY-Z] 
 You run this hard just to stay in place 
 Keep up the pace, baby 
 Keep up the pace 
 You run this hard just to stay in place 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z] 
 Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy 
 Black excellence, you gon' let 'em see 
 Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy 
 Black excellency, baby, let 'em see

 Day, someday, someday we'll all 
 Someday we'll all be free[Intro/Hook: Jay-Z & Pharrell] 
 You can't roll a blunt to this one 
 You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J 
 You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales] 
 You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one 
 You gotta drink Crist-ALL 
 Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7 
 You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 This is for the grown and sexy, uhh 
 Have my baby, let's just make it 
 Excuse me; what's your name? 
 Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second? 
 'Cause I see some ladies tonight 
 That should be hangin' with Jay-Z, Jay-Z 
 So hot to trot, lady! 
 Excuse me miss, what's your name? 
 Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh) 
 Possibly, can I take you out, tonight? 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 You already know what it's hittin' for 
 Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on 
 50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off 
 Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more 
 Only thing missin' is a Missus 
 You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers 
 Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner 
 To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST 
 Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us 
 Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us 
 ..it's the Roc in here! 
 Maybach outside, got rocks in ears 
 PJ's on the runway, Young got air 
 I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport 
 Therefore, I don't wanna hear more 
 Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla! 
  
 [Ph.W.] Sexcuse me... damn! 
 [Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 [Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it 
 [Jay-Z] I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now 
 [Ph.W.] Lady 
 [Jay-Z] You gotta puff a J to this one 
 [Jay-Z] Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy

 [Jay-Z] 'Cause I see some ladies tonight 
 That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z 
 [Ph.W.] You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 Everybody's like, "He's no item! Please don't like him 
 He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!" 
 Now she don't like him, she never met him 
 Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em 
 He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em 
 Better them than me, she don't agree with him 
 She's mad at that, he's not havin' that 
 So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets 
 She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along 
 With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song 
 She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that 
 He 2-ways her, so she writes back 
 Smiley faces after all of her phrases 
 Either she the one or I'm caught in "The Matrix" 
 But fuck it, let the Fishburne 
 Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon! 
  
 [Ph.W.] Sex-cuse me, damn! 
 [Jay-Z] You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one 
 [Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 [Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it 
 [Jay-Z] You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's 
 [Ph.W.] Lady 
 [Jay-Z] Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way 
 [Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 [Jay-Z] Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe 
 [Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it 
 [Ph.W.] Excuse me; what's your name? 
 [Jay-Z] This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy 
 [Ph.W.] So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? 
 [Jay-Z] Woo! 
 [Ph.W.] You're so foxy girl, you're so hot to trot 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one 
 You can easily get past, but that chapter is done 
 ...but I'm done readin' for now 
 Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now 
 But ma you got a f'real f'serious role 
 I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes 
 'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin' 
 But, before I jump out the window, what's your name? 
  
 [Outro: Pharrell] 
 Sex-cuse me, damn! 
 You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 Have my baby, let's just make it 
 Lady 
 You're so contagious, I can't take it 
 Have my baby, let's just make it 
 Excuse me; what's your name? 
 So hot to trot, lady! What's your name?

 [Intro: Pain In Da Ass] 
 Ah shit, okay, okay, alright 
 Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh? 
 Let's see how tough you are 
 You know something about cocaine? Digame! 
 You kidding me or what man? 
 There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys 
 They said they got two keys for us, for openers 
 Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche? 
 I want you to go over there 
 And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back 
 You can do that you make five grand 
 Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday 
 You get the buy money then 
 Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money 
 Eh, pobrecito 
 JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z] 
 Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha 
 Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 Check, check 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds 
 Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold 
 Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie 
 High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly 
 Shopping sprees, cop in three 
 Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes 
 Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha 
 50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me 
 Chrome socks beaming 
 Through my peripheral I see you scheming 
 Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming 
 Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning 
 I'm leaning on any nigga intervening 
 With the sound of my money machining (brrrr) 
 My cup runneth over with hundreds 
 I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running 
 Y'all niggas don't want it 
 I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco 
 Swear to God, don't get it fucked up 
  
 [Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige (Jay-Z)] 
 I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what) 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 ('Cause you can't knock the hustle) 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Last seen out of state where I drop my sling 
 I'm deep in the South kicking up top game 
 Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes 
 Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang 
 Your worst fear confirmed 
 Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm 
 Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn 
 Why play with fire, you burn 
 We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire 
 We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm 
 'Til legs spread like germs 
 I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes 
 And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows 
 What y'all don't know? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle 
  
 [Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige (Jay-Z)] 
 But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy? 
 'Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 ('Cause you can't knock the hustle) 
 The way you make me feel 
 I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock 
 My function is to make much and lay back munching 
 Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch 
 Nothing to stop, un-stoppable 
 Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew 
 I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado 
 My motto, stack rocks like Colorado 
 Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle 
 It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me 
 Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z 
 My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me 
 Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what 
 Straight bananas; can a nigga see me 
 Got the US Open, advantage Jigga 
 Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus 
 Le Tigre, son you're too eager 
 You ain't having it, good me either 
 Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh 
 At my arraignment screaming 
 All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even 
 Thieving, as long as I'm breathing 
 Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even! 
  
 [Chorus 1 + 2: Mary J. Blige] 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
 But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy? 
 'Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real

 This is black hoodie rap 
 There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at 
 Better look on map 
 Besides, me nah like to eye fight 
 Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!) 
 But if a man test my Stuy 
 I promise he won't like my reply 
 Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial 
 I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to 
 Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it 
 Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge 
 Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts 
 So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith 
 Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith 
 Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps 
 Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous 
 Please! Tell me what the name of this shit

 Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me 
 Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey 
 From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky 
 Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie 
 I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T 
 With no history in my borough, they borrow 
 With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow 
 The sun don't come out for many, like Annie 
 Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion 
 Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live 
 I go hard, I owe it all to the crib 
 Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

 While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance 
 Cross that bridge, face the consequence 
 Once bid ten, now I paid my dues 
 Risk takers, we break the rules 
 Get so dark, but I see good 
 Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods 
 Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin' 
 (Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in 
 Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar 
 Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder 
 Right into the clip, bring it to the floor 
 One step, one step, give it up more 
 The road is rough and the street's a mess 
 Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish 
 Robbin' out the commercial stash 
 Kill the voice screamin' in my head

 Ha ha, ha ha 
 What.. '96 and forever 
 Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella 
 Yeah, keep it realer than most 
 Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah 
  
 [Chorus: Mecca] 
 I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët 
 Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set 
 I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye 
 Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it 
 Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it 
 Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this 
 On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit 
 Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die 
 But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick 
 Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but 
 Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher 
 We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up 
 I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up 
 If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged 
 Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches 
 I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it 
 These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it 
 Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint 
 If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point? 
  
 [Chorus: Mecca] 
 I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët 
 Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set 
 I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye 
 Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining 
 I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty? 
 (Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining 
 Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in 
 I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in' 
 Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool 
 I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing 
 Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and 
 Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks 
 No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit 
 '95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit 
 And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit 
 And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with 
 Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit 
 These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it? 
  
 [Chorus: Mecca] 
 I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët 
 Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set

 Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot? 
 The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch 
 I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop 
 Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot 
 Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got 
 Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot 
 Y'all feel me, enough to stop the illing right? 
 But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight 
 I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now 
 I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now 
 It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do 
 And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through 
 I get to zoning: me and this chick on the island and then we're boning 
 I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning 
 Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man 
 It got me going, shit 
  
 [Chorus: Mecca] 
 I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët

 [Intro: Gloria Carter] 
 Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child. 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone." 
 So on that note, I'm leavin' after the song 
 So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long 
 At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on 
 I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves 
 Who made love under the sycamore tree 
 Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim 
 At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain 
 Although through the years I gave her her fair share 
 I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here 
 She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care 
 But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear 
 Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 
 'Cause what's buried under there 
 Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared 
 I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted 
 But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted 
  
 [Interlude: Gloria Carter] 
 Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up. 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me 
 And my momma couldn't beat me 
 Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me 
 So, with that disdain in my membrane 
 Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came 
 Then DeHaven introduced me to the game 
 Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now 
 My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd 
 And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now 
 My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag 
 Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged 
 Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had 
 Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass 
 I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap 
 But that came second to me movin' this crack 
 "Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career 
 'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye! 
  
 [Interlude: Gloria Carter] 
 Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble. 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush 
 Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush 
 And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch 
 No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much 
 And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us 
 Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up 
 And the drought will define a man when the well dries up 
 You learn the worth of water without work 
 You thirst 'til you die, yup! 
 And niggas get tied up for product 
 And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up 
 To show mothers they really got 'em 
 And this was the stress I lived with 
 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven 
 For every bad decision I made, every sister I played 
 ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day 
 And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made 
 This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black 
 If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black 
 Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black 
 If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Maybe you'll love me when I fade...[Produced by No I.D.]

 [Verse 1] 
 I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come 
 You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme 
 Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer 
 When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run 
 Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set 
 To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet 
 Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets 
 So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check 
 I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much 
 And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much 
 So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust 
 I don't know what the fuck they thought 
 Those niggas is foul just like us 
 I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable 
 Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new 
 Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do? 
 You did it. Couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it 
 I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about 
 Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas? 
 Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds 
 At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars 
 Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's 
 But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all? 
 I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars 
 I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 (Brooklyn... so where you from?) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest 
 And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist 
 Where you can't put your vest away 
 And say you'll wear it tomorrow 
 'Cause the day after we'll be saying 
 "Damn, I was just with him yesterday" 
 I'm a block away from hell 
 Not enough shots away from stray shells 
 An ounce away from a triple beam 
 Still using a hand-held weight scale 
 You're laughing, you know the place well 
 Where the liquor stores and the base dwell 
 And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves 
 Where we call the cops the A-Team 
 'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things 
 And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens 
 Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies 
 So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize? 
 If the shit is lies, God strike me 
 And I got a question: 
 Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know 
 One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know 
 The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto 
 Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 (Brooklyn... so where you from?) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards 
 Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen 
 I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street 
 From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet 
 We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep 
 And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet 
 Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off leak 
 And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat 
 Whether you're four-feet or Manute size, it always starts out with 
 Three dice and "shoot the five" 
 Niggas thought they deuce was live, now, I hit 'em with trips 
 And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this 
 This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist 
 And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this 
 Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs 
 Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood 
 Where I'm from 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) 
 (So where you from?)[Produced by LV, Sean C, and Diddy]

 The first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!) 
 The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!) 
 Oh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!) 
 Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim 
 Thanks to a little change, I tore you out the game 
 Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery 
 Thanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy 
 To Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who 
 Carry the work cross state for a gentlemen 
 Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers 
 And most importantly you: the customer

 Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore 
 Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more 
 'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw 
 Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores 
 Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours 
 I figure frauds never hit a lick before 
 So they don't know the feeling when them things get across 
 Put ya hand out the window, feel the force 
 Feel the Porsche, hit defrost 
 Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws 
 Drop got no top, you on the top floor

 Her-on got less steps than Britney 
 That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

 Rare Porsches, rare portraits 
 Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress 
 This apple sauce is from the apple orchard 
 This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses 
 Which means I get it from the ground 
 Which means you get it when I'm around 
 Rich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs 
 Mazel tov, it's a celebration bitches! 
 "L'chaim!" 
 I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time 
 Cheers, toast to crime 
 Number one D-boy, shame he could rhyme

 I am a Roc representer, (Hov'), summer to winter

 One CD or three hundred and sixty pies 
 What's up to E and Kirk? Welcome home to Taj 
 Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (uhh) 
 We run streets like drunks run street lights 
 We collidin' with life as we speak 
 We knee-deep in coke, we ki deep in ice 
 We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke 
 We all fish, better teach your folk 
 Give him money to eat, the next week he's broke 
 'Cause when you sleep he's reachin' for your throat 
 Word on the skreet, you reap what you sow 
 Not out of fear but love, love for the game 
 Roc family first, we never change, man

 I'll never mention your name, I promise respect 
 Death before dishonor, correct? 
 Yup, that's what you promised me, since the Bomber League 
 Along with, if we stay strong 
 We can get paper longer than Pippen's arms (woo!) 
 Plead the fifth when it comes to the fam 
 I'm like a dog: I never speak, but I understand 
 Where my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war? 
 Where your balls at? Whoa, gotta pause that, whoa 
 Lost 92 bricks, had to fall back 
 Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back 
 Had A-1 credit, got more crack 
 From the first to the fifth, gave it all back 
 If I'm not a hustler, what you call that? 
 This is before rap, this is all fact; I never change 
  
 [Chorus: Kanye West, sample & (JAY-Z)]

 [Verse 3: Jay Z] 
 What, the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly 
 Well, fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari 
 Was so young my big sis' still playin' with Barbie 
 Young brother, big city, eight million stories 
 Old heads taught me, youngin, walk softly 
 Carry a big clip, that'll get niggas off me 
 Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy 
 Chains is cool to cop but more important is lawyer fees 
 (Uhh) That's how it is now, (uhh) that's how it always be 
 (Uhh) I never change, this is always me 
 From the womb to the tomb, from now until my doom 
 Drink Army from one cup, pass it around the room (that's a family nigga) 
 That's the ritual (yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool 
 And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through 
 This is crew love, move music or move drugs 
 Rival crews, get your black suits up; I'll never change

 Never, never, never, never change 
 I'm still fuckin' with crime 'cause crime pays (come on)

 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 I got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it 
 Let that bitch breathe! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less 
 What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress 
 I guess I blew up quick 
 'Cause friends I grew up with 
 See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big 
 I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious 
 My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with 
 Shit, let that bitch breathe! 
 I'm way too important to be talking about extorting 
 Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin 
 Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch 
 You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss 
 Bye bye, my reply... "BLAH, BLAH" 
 Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty 
 Finish my breakfast, why? 
 I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry 
 Now where was I? 
 Let that bitch breathe! 
 I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more 
 Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor 
 I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about? 
 A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths 
 All this stress, all I got is this big house 
 Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out 
 All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out 
 I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours 
 How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu? 
 Hold up, let me move my bowels 
 I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys 
 (Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!) 
 I got watches I ain't seen in months 
 Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once 
 Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies 
 Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money 
 Y'all ain't got nothing for me 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z] 
 Nas, let that bitch breathe! 
  
 [Verse 2: Nas] 
 Success, McLaren, women staring 
 My villain appearance 
 Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling 
 Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello 
 Camaro driven, I climax from paper 
 Then ask: "Why is life worth living?" 
 Is it to hunt for the shit that you want? 
 To receive's great, but I lust giving 
 The best jewelers wanna make my things 
 I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain 
 Niggas mentioned on One Love 
 Came home to the paper in hand 
 Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man 
 Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments 
 Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents 
 Worst enemies wanna be my best friends 
 Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in 
 But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den 
 Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in 
 Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much 
 Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch 
 Let this bitch breathe! (Ha heh)

 Everything, everything this my only single thing 
 Everything I hear is my answer 
 And if you think I say, then innocent if I say? 
 I never hear that, I be in the posse 
 Never seen a ceiling in my whole life 
 Everything I seen, everything is rotten 
 Never sit in silence, innocent is Carter 
 Innocent we seek them 
 I and say we see them

 [Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview] 
 Gotta try to stay above water, y'know? 
 Just stay busy, stay working 
 Puff told me, like, the key to this joint 
 The key to staying on top of things 
 Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'? 
 Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern 
 Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all wanna know why he don't stop? 
 Y'all wanna know why he don't flop? 
 Let me tell you pe-people why 
 Came from the bottom of the block I 
 When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit 
 Had to pull the opposite out this bitch 
 Had to get my ri-ide on 
 Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to 
 Had to had to get these chips 
 Had to make moves like Olajuwon 
 Started out selling dimes and nicks 
 Graduated to a brick 
 No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip 
 Legendary like a schoolboy 
 Crushin' merely nearly every every chick 
 Heavy shit – that's how schoolboy got whipped 
 And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I 
 On some Trugoy shit 
 Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return 
 Had to play with fire and get burned 
 Only way the boy ever gon' learn 
 Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn 
 Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle 
 The songs that I sing to you is my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst is the same as when I came 
 It's my joy and my tears 
 And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Like I never rode in a limo 
 Like I just dropped flows to a demo 
 Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental 
 Back in the Stu' again 
 No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple 
 When you think back, you thought that 
 You would never make it this far 
 Then you take advantage of the luck you handed 
 Or the talent you been given 
 Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin' 
 Ain't no different from a block that's hittin' 
 Gotta get it while the getting's good 
 Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop 
 Then you gotta bid it, good riddance 
 Goodbye! This is my second major breakup 
 My first was with a pager 
 With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME 
 This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune 
 Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle 
 The songs that I sing to you is my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst is the same as when I came 
 It's my joy and my tears 
 And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst like the first song I sang

 Niggas thought we was crazy, man, remember uhh 
 You had that fucked up ass handwriting 
 You was writing all the numbers that we was spending down 
 For the videos we was doing ourselves

 Your accounting was crazy wrong and shit 
 But we still put it together 
 Biggs, whassup? 
 Member we went to St. Thomas and uh (John Meneilly)

 Emory was there; whattup, Emory? 
 What up, Ty? Hip-Hop, whattup, man? 
 Aye, aye Hop, you ain't, you ain't have no uhh

 (It's intoxicating man, y'all don't know why you do what you do) 
 Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 The allure of breaking the law 
 Was always too much for me to ever ignore 
 I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses 
 In love with a V-Dub engine 
 Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted 
 Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist 
 My women-friends get tennis bracelets 
 Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with 
 The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded 
 Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it 
 I put my feet in the footprints left to me 
 Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy 
 Man, my brother hustled so, naturally 
 Up next was me, but what perplexes me 
 Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play 
 The starring role in "Hovito's Way" 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)] 
 It's just life, I solemnly swear 
 To change my approach, stop shaving coke 
 Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 
 'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!) 
 But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back 
 It called me right back 
 Man, it called me right back (OH NO!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka 
 Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real 
 Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda 
 Turn the pot up, make a soufflé 
 All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way 
 I'm living proof that crime do pay 
 Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads 
 Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game 
 Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train: 
 All in the name of love 
 Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came 
 Over the house to take back everything that they claimed 
 Or even the worse pain is the distress 
 Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain 
 And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust 
 Now it gets tough to ever love again 
 But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name 
 To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain 
 To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes: 
 We all hustlers in love with the same thing 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)] 
 It's just life, I solemnly swear 
 To change my approach, stop shaving coke 
 Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 
 'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!) 
 But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back 
 It called me right back 
 Man, it called me right back (OH NO!) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I never felt more alive than riding shotgun 
 In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns 
 And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need - 
 What the game did to my pulse - with no results 
 And you can treat your nose and still won't come close 
 The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts 
 And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss 
 The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off 
 By any means necessary, whatever the cost 
 Even if it means lives is lost 
 And I can't explain why I just love to get high 
 Drink, "life!" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice 
 I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times 
 I may not even be alive 
 I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure 
 Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse, of course 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)] 
 It's just life, I solemnly swear 
 To change my approach, stop shaving coke 
 Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 
 'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!) 
 But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back 
 It called me right back 
 Man, it called me right back (OH NO!) 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)] 
 Once again its the life 
 Yeah I said its the life 
 Once I again its the life 
 (OH NO! I don't know why, I... 
 Get so high oh 
 Get so high oh 
 Get so high, high off the life)Hey sucka nigga, wherever you are 
 I thought about you, fool, while I was driving my car 
 I wonder if you fools realize how far, you are 
 You're no where in my rear mirror 
  
 Your last shit ain't better than my first shit 
 Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit 
 The truth in my verses versus 
 Your metaphors about what your net worth is 
  
 Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha![Audience clapping] 
  
 [Intro: Maria Davis] 
 Yo wassup everybody, this is Maria Davis, Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time 
 ("Yo! Start the show! Start the show!") 
 Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z 
 Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that lil tape of yours, and it's phat 
 Why don't you come up here and kick a lil freestyle 
 Put that champagne down, and kick a lil freestyle for me tonight 
  
 [Intro: Jay-Z & Audience] 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit 
 Let's do it again! 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Well I'm gone... check this out 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Too much West Coast dick lickin' 
 And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition 
 Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions 
 That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen 
 Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho 
 I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady 
 Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances 
 Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is 
 Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances 
 No question; Jay-Z got too many answers 
 I been around this block too many times 
 Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too 
 To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together 
 'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever 
 I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine 
 So I change styles every two rhymes 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 Hah, what the fuck 
 That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean? 
 Shall I continue? Check it out, what? 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z] 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) 
 Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya 
 Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up 
 Too many faggot niggas clockin' my spendin' 
 Exercisin' your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons 
 If you could catch Jay right, on the late night 
 Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right 
 I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen 
 Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name 
 At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket 
 Feelin' sarcastic, "Look at him, still sleepin'" 
 You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty 
 Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy 
 Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what? 
 Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me? 
  
 [Outro: Maria Davis] 
 Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track (aight) 
 Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96? 
 (No doubt, no doubt) 
 Well, it is definitely the bomb! But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know you've been havin' a lot of problems with the law 
 But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time! 
 (Hah, thanks a lot) 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly 
 ("Hey, shut the fuck up!") 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech! 
 Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'... we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies goin' like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got this, put our own money in our businesses...[Hook] 
 I got myself a gun 
 Yeah, I got myself a gun 
  
 Brooklyn stand up, I got myself a gun 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 But really, I don't need the heat 
 Your heart pump project Kool-Aid, you're sweet 
 I don't gotta two-way you gays 
 This is not beef, this is rap homie 
 I don't have a scratch on me 
 You feel Jay soft, rip Jay off 
 Damn I'm only worth over a hundred million 
 Look, I got beef with like a hundred children 
 Niggas with pink suits (faggot) tryna get cute 
 You a little outta line homie, don't let the 9 homie 
 Put you out your mind homie, just rhyme homie 
 Kick your little lies I kick my real facts 
 Like you sneaking out the back of the Source Soundlab 
 We wasn't chasing you, we had a taping too 
 We came through to do our one-two thing 
 It wasn't a Roc-A-Fella come-through thing 
 'Cause if it was on like that, I would come through Queens 
 With Queens niggas, you know how I do 
 Look, I got more shooters in Queensbridge than you 
 Niggas'll tie you up on the Colosseum roof 
 And open beer bottles off the boy chipped tooth 
 Look here 
  
 [Hook] 
 I got myself a gun 
 Yeah, I got myself a gun 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Listen, I'm the J, the A, to the fuck this broad 
 This nigga never sold Aspirin, how you Escobar? 
 Had to buy your chain back last time you got robbed 
 The nerve of this coward nigga, oh my God 
 And I don't rap rumors or innuendos 
 I bring it to you live, lift up your window 
 Let the public peek in, see your dirty laundry 
 Y'all dont want me to continue 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Super ugly 
 I don't give a fuck! 
 All I really know is your ho wants to be with me 
 And she ain't playing, and what I'm saying 
 She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Me and the boy A.I. got more in common 
 Than just balling and rhyming; get it? More in Carmen 
 I came in your Bentley backseat, skeeted in your Jeep 
 Left condoms on your baby seat 
 Here nigga, the gloves is off, the love is done 
 It's whatever, whenever, however nigga - one 
 And since you infatuated with saying that gay shit 
 Yes you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch 
 Nasty shit, you thought I was boning Renette 
 You calling Carm' a hundred times, I was boning her neck 
 You got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet 
 When does your lies end, when does the truth begin 
 When does reality set in or does it not matter 
 Gotta hurt I'm your baby mama's favorite rapper 
 And ask your current girl, she know what's up 
 Holla at a real nigga, Jigga (I don't give a fuck!)[Intro: Jay-Z & (Funkmaster Flex)] 
 I been crushing the building since Izod socks 
 I'm so independent, sh..I might buy Koch 
 I might not stop 
 Places to cop, seventy-six floors, you can call me the Doc| 
 Say when, say when 
 (When!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire 
 Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired 
 Build me up, break me down to build me up again 
 They like: "Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again" 
 Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close 
 How I'm 'posed to win, they got me fightin' ghosts 
 Same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with 
 Sh.., Thats' only half if they like you 
 That ain't even the half what they might do 
 Don't believe me, ask Michael 
 See Martin, see Malcolm 
 You see Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome 
 See Jesus, see Judas; see Caesar, see Brutus 
 See success is like suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 If you succeed, prepare to be crucified 
 Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle 
 Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto 
 So it's tough bein' Bobby Brown 
 To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now 
 Now the question is, is to have had and lost 
 Better than not having at [all] 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Everybody wanna be the King then shots ring 
 You layin' on your balcony with holes in your dream 
 Or you Malcolm X'd out, get distracted by screams 
 Everybody get your hand off my jeans 
 Everybody look at you strange, say you changed 
 Uhh! Like you work that hard to stay the same 
 Uhh! Game stays the same, the name changes 
 So its best for those to not overdose on being famous 
 Most kings get driven so insane 
 That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did 
 No dangers, so shameless 
 Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers 
 Low chain 'em as the enemies approach 
 So raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat 
 And the Spirit I'm evoking 
 Hold on 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Everybody screaming they want the old Hov 
 But the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols 
 Everybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto 
 But my mind is on Pluto 
 Bills that I do fold, I now invest on 
 Trying to find some loopholes in the IRS 
 As where I used to have a few hoes I am just 
 Concentrating on making a new Hov through sex 
 I've awakened just in time to school those putos 
 Trying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze 
 Better adhere to this text 'fore you go 
 Broke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes 
 I know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own 
 At least my conscience is clear, I'm no longer steering you wrong 
 Ain't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home 
 Take care of your home, you can go back and—ugh! 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 I'm getting courted by the bosses 
 The Edgars And Doug Morris-es-es 
 Jimmy I's and Lyors-es -- it's 
 Gotta be more than the choruses 
 They respecting my mind now 
 Just a matter of time now 
 Operation: Takeover Corporate 
 Makeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it 
 Please may these words be recorded 
 To serve as testimony that I saw it all before it 
 Came to fruition, sort of a premonition 
 Uncontrollable hustler's ambition 
 Alias Superstition, like Stevie 
 The writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby? 
 Saw it all before, some of y'all thought I was crazy, maybe 
 Like a fox, I'm cagey, ah-ah 
 The more successful, the more stressful 
 The more and more I transform to Gordon Gekko 
 In the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling 
 Got my knees on the floor please Lord forgive him 
 Has he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him? 
 He's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him? 
 I got the Forbes on my living room floor 
 And I'm still talking to the poor, nigga I want more 
 TIME's most influential, was impressive 
 'Specially since I wasn't in the artist section 
 Had me with the builders and the titans 
 Had me right with Rupert Murdoch 
 Billionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of 
 Word up on Madison Ave is I'm a cash cow 
 Word down on Wall Street, homie, you get the cash out 
 IPO Hov, no need for reverse merger 
 The boy money talk no need to converse further 
 The baby blue Maybach like I own Gerber 
 Boardroom I'm lifting ya skirt up[Produced by No I.D. and Kanye West] 
  
 [Intro: JAY-Z] 
 Yeezy, Hova, Yeezy 
 Yeezy Yeezy, Hova, hold up 
 You either love me or leave me alone 
 You either love me or leave me alone

 These niggas want me to go, don’t they know that I'm gone 
 They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen 
 Don't they know that they boring? Don’t they know that I yawn? 
 Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn 
 Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde? 
 Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them 
 Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on 
 Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs 
 What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly 
 You talk me to death, only thing you do is talk 
 I open the door for them, what else can I do 
 These niggas want me to walk for them 
 Somebody talk to them before I go off on them 
  
 [Hook: Kid Cudi & JAY-Z] 
 Oh, they want me to fall (fall)

 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 I taught 'em 'bout fish scale, they want me to fish for them 
 They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them 
 All of this just for them or they got a diss for him 
 They want me to disappear like it's gon shift for them 
 They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them 
 But what they admitting is they ain't got shit for him 
 And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket 
 Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets 
 Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches 
 So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing? 
 Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone 
 The shit that you just witnessing I been on 
 And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it 
 Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it 
 Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel 
 But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal 
 Half man half mammal, my sign is a Sag 
 This is just what I planned to do, oh, don't be mad 
  
 [Hook: Kid Cudi & JAY-Z] 
 Oh, they want me to fall (fall)

 Geah.. whassup? 
 To all my street niggas, project niggas 
 Real niggas, worldwide 
 Let's reflect, everybody got a story 
 We all ghetto B, here's mine 
 Geah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 See I was born in sewage, born to make bomb music 
 Flow tight like I was born Jewish 
 Used the streets as a conduit 
 I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick 
 At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news 
 Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid 
 Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too 
 Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it 
 My life is getting too wild 
 I need to bring some sort calm to it 
 Bout to lose it voices screaming "Don't do it!" 
 It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year 
 That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked 
 Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked 
 Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block 
 Like "Damn, I'ma be a failure" 
 Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia 
 Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us 
 Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts 
 Trying to figure where your mail is 
 Guesstimate the weight you selling 
 So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait! 
 It gets worse, baby momma water burst 
 Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on 
 Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb 
 Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
  
 [Verse 2: Beanie Sigel] 
 Chill dog 
 Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother 
 Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother 
 Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another 
 I'm thinking damn; how my older sister goin' make me tougher 
 When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real 
 I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills 
 Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real 
 Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real 
 What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real 
 What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real 
 Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans 
 Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min 
 Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an 
 I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine 
 Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body 
 Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me 
 I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me 
 Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me 
 There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans 
 Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin 
 My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog 
 Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog 
 I come back in the afterlife 
 Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
  
 [Verse 3: Scarface] 
 Life.. yeah.. uhh.. 
 Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig' 
 I got a phone call from one of my nigs 
 Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids 
 And when I heard that I just broke into tears 
 And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is 
 But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib 
 So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news 
 Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two 
 Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars 
 Loving your kids just like you was ours 
 And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours 
 I just know that heaven'll open these doors 
 And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this 
 God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company 
 Who loves all and hates not one 
 And one day you gon' be with your son 
 I could've rapped about my hard times on this song 
 But heaven knows I woulda been wrong 
 I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love 
 It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us 
 This can't be life 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
 This can't be life, this can't be love 
 This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us 
 This can't be life...[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Young Hov in the house, it's so necessary 
 Green Lantern in the house, so necessary 
 Why you fronting on me? Is that necessary? 
 You know you've become a star 
 Because you're the biggest target out there, right? 
 When everyone's on the court, they're coming for you 
 When the opposing player walks into that arena 
 They're thinkin of upstaging you 
 You're, you're like a trophy to them 
 They're thinkin' "if I'm better than this guy 
 The spotlight turns on me" 
 So, you know you're a superstar because you're a marked man 
 And everyone's coming for you 
  
 [Run DMC sample] 
 The, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king (king) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z (Chris Martin)] 
 Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire 
 Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired 
 Build me up to break me down to build me up again 
 They like "Hov', we need you back so we can kill your ass again" 
 Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close 
 How I'm 'posed to win? They got me fighting ghosts 
 Most kings (... get their heads cut off) 
 With the same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with 
 Shit, that's only half if they like you 
 That ain't even the half what they might do 
 Don't believe me, ask Michael 
 See Martin, see Malcolm 
 See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome 
 See Jesus, see Judas 
 See Caesar, see Brutus 
 See success is like suicide 
 Suicide, it's a suicide 
 When you succeed, prepare to be crucified, uhh 
 Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle 
 Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto 
 So it's tough being Bobby Brown 
 To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now 
 Now the question is, "Is to have had and lost 
 Better than not having at all?" 
 Because dawg 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Martin & Run DMC sample] 
 Most kings get their heads cut off 
 Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top 
 Keep on coming if they ready or not 
 Most kings get their heads cut off 
 The, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king 
 They wanna be 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, everybody wanna be the king then shots ring 
 You laying on your balcony with holes in your dream 
 Or you Malcolm X'd out, get distracted by screams 
 Everybody get your hand off my jeans 
 Everybody look at you strange, say you changed 
 Like you work that hard to stay the same, uhh 
 Game stays the same, the name changes 
 So it's best for those to not overdose on being famous 
 Most kings get driven so insane 
 That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did 
 So dangerous, so no strangers 
 Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers 
 Load chambers, the enemy's approaching 
 So raise your draw bridge and drown 'em in the moat 
 Then, spirit I'm evoking 
 There's kings who've been awoken 
 From shots from those who was most close to them 
 They won't stop until you ghost to 'em 
 But real kings don't die 
 They become martyrs, let's toast to 'em 
 King Arthur, put a robe to him 
 Like James Brown, no the show ain't over 
 Until Rome's ruined 
 'Til the republic is overthrown 
 'Til my loyal subjects is over Hov' 
 Long live the king, no, the reign won't stop 
 They want my head on the chopping block 
 I won't die, nah 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Martin, Jay-Z & Run DMC sample] 
 Most kings get their heads cut off 
 Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top 
 Keep on coming if they ready or not 
 Most kings get their heads cut off 
 Keep on coming if they ready or not 
 Long live the king, know the reign won't stop 
 The, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king 
 They wanna be 
 Long live the, the, the king 
 They wanna be the, the, the king 
 They wanna be 
 Most kings get their heads cut off 
 Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top 
 Keep on coming if they ready or not[Intro]

 [Verse 1] 
 You can catch me 
 Skatin' through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin' 
 No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan 
 Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to 
 Hustle behind the wheel, tryin' to escape my trouble 
 Kids stop they greetin' me, I'm talking sweet to keys 
 Cursin' the very God that brought this grief to be 
 My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis 
 And fools that think I slip, you fuck around 
 You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy 
 On some I-do-or-die shit, for real 
 The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and 
 Just think, Winter's here, I'm tryin' to feel mink, nigga 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Politics as usual 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I took my Frito to Tito in the district 
 Blessed me with some VS 
 Somethings I can live with: stop frontin' 
 And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised 
 No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true 
 I'm takin' wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson 
 Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off 
 You ain't seen money in your life, when it 
 Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice 
 I'm smokin' bros who pump Willie, I expose 
 The furthest you Chiles been is the Poconos 
 My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please 
 10-year felon, heavy on the wrist, I faze yous 
 With the diamond flooded Jesus and blind your facials 
 For life, right, it's Jigga, I keep it tight nigga 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Politics as usual 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You feel my triumph never - feel my pain 
 I'm lyin' low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came 
 The game changes like my mind just ain't right 
 Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night 
 Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember 
 Tellin' my family: "I'll be back soon"; that was December 
 '85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later 
 Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties 
 I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot 
 Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox 
 Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage 
 It's a lot of big money in my sentence 
 Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that 
 Chick baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that 
 Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin' 
 The drawers from droppin', the law from watchin' - I hate 'em

 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, uhh, yes sir! 
 Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh 
 Y'all niggas got me really confused out there 
 I make Big Pimpin' or Give It 2 Me one of those 
 Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century 
 I make some thought provokin' shit 
 Y'all question whether he fallin' off? 
 I'ma really confuse y'all on this one... follow! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down 
 Like when them shots come out, make cops come around 
 When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town 
 Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds 
 Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out 
 The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out 
 "That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout 
 Either what chick he with, or his chip amount 
 'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out 
 Watchin' Erik Estrada 
 Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder 
 A/C broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour 
 Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight 
 You might see me anywhere, a day in the life 
 Only thing changed the tail number on the flight 
 I can touch down and take off the same night 
 I'm so bossy, bitch get off me 
 Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me 
 I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees 
 Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 This is that ignorant shit you like 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you love 
 Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you need 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon 
 I'm only tryin' to give you what you want 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front! 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards 
 Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers 
 They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice 
 So don't believe everything your earlobe captures 
 It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me 
 And everything said in song you happen to see 
 Then, actually, believe half of what you see 
 None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me 
 And with that said, I will kill niggas dead 
 Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs 
 I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell 
 Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa! 
 This ain't B.R., no, it's S.C., CEO 
 The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world 
 And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go... 
  
 [Verse 3: Beanie Sigel] 
 Uhh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate 
 It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate 
 The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig so rude 
 Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food 
 Now see if I care if this verse get aired 
 Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah 
 I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me 
 Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 I missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout Imus 
 What do my lyrics got to do with this shit! 
 Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me 
 Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me 
 Are you saying what I'm spittin' 
 Is worse than these celebrataunts showin' they kitten, you kiddin'! 
 Let's stop the bullshittin' 
 'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin' 
 Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me 
 Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me 
 Let's stop the bullshittin' 
 'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 This is that ignorant shit you like 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you love 
 Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you need 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon

 Put ya inside the mattress like drug money, nigga

 Yeah, I done told you niggas 9 or 10 times, stop fuckin' with me

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya 
 Am I frightenin' ya? Shall I continue? 
 I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song 
 I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along 
 Now it's a duet and you wet when you check out 
 The technique from the two TECs and I don't need two lips 
 To blow this like a trumpet, you dumb shit 
 This is a unusual musical I conductin' 
 You lookin' at the black Warren Buffett 
 So all critics can duck sick 
 I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it 
 Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rilin' me up 
 For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup 
 Now they 'bout to free me up, what you think I'm gon' be, what? 
 Rehabilitated, man, I still feel hatred 
 I'm young, black and rich so they wanna strip me naked 
 But you never had me like Christina Aguiler-y 
 But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry 
 Or the FDR in the seat of my car 
 Screamin' out the sunroof "death to y'all" 
 You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars 
 I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head 
 The whole hood'll want ya, you startin' to look like bread 
 I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' 'bout feds 
 Nigga, them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin' 
 Put your smarts on the side of your garment 
 Nigga stop fuckin' with me 
 R … I … P … 
  
 [Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer] 
 That's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild 
 Nigga I keep trash bags with me 
 Never know when you gotta dump a nigga out 
 This sincere, this some sincere shit right here! 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Grown man, I put hands on you 
 I dig a hole in the desert, they build the Sands on you 
 Lay out blueprint plans on you 
 We Rat Pack niggas, let Sam tap dance on you 
 Then I Sinatra shot ya, goddamn you 
 I put the boy in the box like David Blaine 
 Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang 
 Y'all wish I was frontin', I George Bush the button 
 For the oil in your car, lift up your hood, nigga run it 
 Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it 
 Your boy got the goods, y'all don't want nothin' of it 
 Like, castor oil, I'll Castor Troy you 
 Change your face or the bullets change all that for you 
 Y'all niggas is targets 
 Y'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it 
 In your upper level 
 Valet a couple strays from the .38 Special, nigga, God bless you 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin' 
 Put your smarts on the side of your garment 
 Nigga stop fuckin' with me 
 R … I … P … 
  
 [Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer] 
 Yeah I'm threatenin' ya, YEAH I'm threatenin' ya! 
 Who you thank you dealin' with? 
 They call me Threats, nigga 
 I been makin' threats since I been in kindergarten, nigga! 
 Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 When the gun's tucked, untucked, nigga you dies 
 Like nunchuks held by the Jet L-I 
 I'm the one, thus meaning no one must try 
 No two, no three, no four—know why? 
 Because one's four-five might blow yo' high 
 You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God 
 It's a match made in heaven when I [blaow] 'splay the 7 
 Put you on the nigga news, UPN and 11 
 Where you been? You ain't heard? 
 Got the word that I'm [blaow blaow] that I'm so sincere? 
 I'm especially Joe Pesci with it, friend 
 I will kill you, commit suicide and kill you again 
 That's right

 Whattup? Motherfucker, I keep three motherfuckers what? 
 Nigga I'll throw a Molotov cocktail 
 Through your momma's momma's house 
 Nigga what the, where everybody live! 
 Undercover nigga, take your teeth out your mouth nigga 
 Chew your food up and put the shit back in your mouth nigga 
 And help you swallow 
 Nigga I take a mop handle off nigga 
 And sweep nigga, hold on, I'll be, nigga what?[Intro: Jay-Z & Too $hort] 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right 
 It was all good just a week ago 
 Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago 
 Last week I had everything 
 Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago 
 I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches 
 Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago 
 And the jewelry.. 
 And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin' 
 Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo 
 Beatch! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me 
 We used to hustle in the hood for all to see 
 Problems; I called on him, he called on me 
 We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P 
 Let him unlock doors off my keys 
 Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially 
 Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly 
 The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly 
 Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me 
 Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed 
 Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change 
 And when he called collect and I heard his name 
 I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone 
 He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone 
 I said: "Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?" 
 He said: "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home." 
 I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone 
 Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin' 
 I said: "The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on." 
 From there I sensed the beef was on 
 I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone 
 To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone 
 Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced 
 And they show the other side, when they catch a new case 
 It's on 
  
 [Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z] 
 It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke 
 And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks 
 I don't see how this side of you could be provoked 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago 
 Funny what seven days can change 
 A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim 
 Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names 
 It was all good just a week ago 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell 
 We both came in this game, blind as hell 
 I did a little better, had more clientele 
 Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail 
 Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill' 
 I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal 
 Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real 
 I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill 
 Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville 
 Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30 
 Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack 
 Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at? 
 Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack 
 You tell them Feds I said: "I'm never going back" 
 I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats 
 You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious 
  
 [Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z] 
 It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke 
 And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks 
 I don't see how this side of you could be provoked 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago 
 Funny what seven days can change 
 A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim 
 Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names 
 It was all good just a week ago 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things 
 All this after a week in the bing 
 I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling 
 I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing 
 Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke 
 Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us 
 We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that? 
 Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor 
 Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right) 
 The same game that make you math could make you die 
 (That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap 
 Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat? 
 Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad 
 And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?" 
 The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar 
 You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars 
  
 [Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z] 
 It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke 
 And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks 
 I don't see how this side of you could be provoked 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago 
 Funny what seven days can change 
 A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim 
 Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names 
 It was all good just a week ago 
  
 [Outro: Too $hort] 
 Shit is crazy man 
 All these niggas out here snitchin' 
 We was one step away from takin' this crack money 
 And recyclin' it through the ghettos 
 And buildin' back up our own hoods 
 Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other 
 I got partners doin' 15-20 
 Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT 
 If you didn't snitch, beatch! 
 It's about time y'all check that shit out man 
 It ain't all good, shut your mouth 
 Just watch the game 
 And don't snitch 
 We'd sure go a lot whole further 
 Believe that baby 
 Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane 
 You know I got it 
 Got it goin' on 
 We got the money 
 Ain't got nuthin' to do with crime baby 
 But I'm recognizin'

 'Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps 
 (New York, New York!) Yeah, where my troopers at? 
 Where my hustlers, where my boosters at? 
 I don't care what you do for stacks 
 I know the world glued your back to the wall 
 You gotta brawl, do that 
 I been through that, been shot at, shoot back 
 Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist 
 I ain't a New Jack; nobody gon' Wesley Snipe me 
 It's less than likely, move back 
 Let I breathe, Jedi Knight 
 The more space I get the better I write 
 Oh, never I write, but if, ever I write 
 I need the space to say whatever I like, now just

 Or you can come by yourself if you can stand him 
 Best believe, I sweat out weaves

 Aww you get if could move it 
 Back it on up like a U-Haul truck 
 Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit 
 He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music 
 He is to the East coast what Snoop is 
 To the West Coast, what 'Face is to Houston 
 Young Hov' in the house is so necessary 
 No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary 
 No panties and jeans, that's so necessary 
 Now why you fronting on me, is that necessary? 
 Do I, to you, look like a lame 
 Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game 
 Who's up on dot dot dot and Vera Wang 
 Ma are you insane? Let's just

 Wearing that platinum shit

 I'm going to show you how to do it, check it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, I spit that other shit 
 That's a nice motherfucker shit 
 That Fed time follow me around, Deep Cover shit, nigga 
 You beer money, I'm all year money 
 I'm "Papi, you ain't got to count it, it's all there" money 
 I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money 
 NARC'd up, marked up, fucked up in the game money 
 I got bail money, double-XL money 
 You got flash now, but time will reveal money 
 I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit 
 That down-South, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit 
 I got blood money, straight up thug money 
 That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money 
 You got show dough, little to no dough 
 Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough 
 I got 900 and 96 plus 4 mo' dough 
 You crazy, you fugazi, I'm loco with dough papo

 [Verse 2] 
 And now you got these young cats acting like they slung caps 
 All in they dumb raps, talking about how they funds stack 
 When I see them in the street, I don't see none of that 
 Damn playboy, where the fuck is the hummer at? 
 Where is all the ice with all the platinum under that? 
 Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that? 
 Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me 
 You're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me 
 I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me 
 And still you running around thinking you got something on me 
 But I done did it 
 And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it 
 That's cool, I was the first one with it 
 Origin-al, Jigga's the future, flow digit-al 
 Still busting a gat when shit gets criti-cal 
 Sit it down, I don't want y'all to get it confused 
 I rip it down, like I ain't got nothing to lose 
 (Y'all get it now?) 
  
 [Chorus: René & Angela sample] 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Groupies I leave 'em all fucked; niggas, awe struck 
 Your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks 
 Last year, when niggas thought it was all up 
 But this year I've done it again, Jigga! What the fuck? 
 Nigga stop whining, Jigga, still shining 
 Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds 
 Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet 
 I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party 
 Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me 
 Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me 
 I flow like the 5 Series, in various areas 
 And blow holes in your weak niggas theories 
 It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game 
 You bought a 4.0 you better get your change 
 Ain't no platinum in those Cartiers, switch your frames 
 Ain't no manicurist on board, then switch your plane 
  
 [Chorus: René & Angela sample] 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
 Imaginary playmates 
  
 [Outro] 
 I mean, like, be truthful, man: how you think you gon' feel, right? 
 You pull up in your 4.0 with your bitch 
 I pull up in the 4.6 with my bitch with the seat back 
 Bumping some other shit, you know, some OTHER shit 
 You'll probably hop on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch 
 Ask me some stupid shit like 
 "Yo, yo dog, what’s the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6?" 
 Like 30 to 40 grand, cocksucker, beat it! Haha 
 Yo, them shits even got leathers?[Refrain] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause 
 For I just applied logic keys, keys open doors 
 Now I'm balcony, Opera, black tux, binocular 
 Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular 
 Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up 
 On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up 
 How would I know HBO would get a shot of us 
 Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us 
 Please don't bow in my presence – how am I a legend? 
 I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven 
 More hits than a Now 11 
 That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven 
 Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes 
 Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace! 
 Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate 
 For the winter I be fly all summer? Might I say 
  
 [Refrain] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight 
 We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright 
 We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive 
 If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die 
 No no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched 
 I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits 
 For The Color of Money like a Tom Cruise flick 
 'Cept I put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks 
 Beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh 
 Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh 
 Dangers approaches, we're like: "Wait, who's this?" 
 Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is? 
 This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips 
 You can lay in your casket just as you is 
 We appreciate the target practices 
 We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid 
  
 [Refrain] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves 
 I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales 
 I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help 
 And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell 
 'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well 
 Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell 
 Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled 
 Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled 
 Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell 
 'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills 
 Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ILL 
 And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel 
  
 [Refrain] 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines 
  
 [Outro] 
 We are really high, really really high, no 
 Really really high, really high tonight, ha 
 We are really high, really high tonight 
 We are really high, really high tonight

 Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uhh 
 Wooo! Wooo! Wooo! Wooo! 
 I, am, back, niggas 
 Ha ha ha ha ha.. uh-oh, uh-oh - wooo! 
 Ladies and gentlemen -- H, to the Izzo 
 I wanna thank everybody out there for they purchase 
 I surely appreciate it - woo! 
 What you about to witness is my thoughts 
 Just my thoughts, man—right or wrong 
 Just what I was feeling at the time, uhh 
 You ever felt like this, vibe with me 
 Walk with a nigga, man, just vibe with me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, gather round hustlers—that's if you still livin' 
 And get on down to that ol' Jig rhythm 
 Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison 
 A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high 
 I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people 
 Mouthpiece for hustlers - I'm back, motherfuckers 
 Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns 
 Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on? 
 I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm 
 Charges don't stick to dude, he's Teflon 
 I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred 
 I'm not guilty, now gimme back my bread 
 Mr. District Attorney, I'm not sure if they told you 
 I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to? 
 Plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight 
 Hov' a soldier, Hov' been fightin' all his life so 
 What could you do to me? It's not new to me 
 Sue me? Fuck you, what's a couple dollars to me? 
 But you will respect me, simple as that 
 Or I got no problem goin' back 
 I'm representin' for the seat where Rosa Parks sat 
 Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped 
 So off we go, let the trumpets blow 
 And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro 
 The ruler's back 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh 
 I, am, BACK, niggas - woo! woo! woo! woo! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Turn the motherfuckin' music up 
 The ruler's back 
 I, am, back, niggas 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Well, in these times—well, at least to me 
 There's a lot of rappers out there tryin' to sound like Jay-Z 
 I'll help you out, here's what you do 
 You gonna need a wide lens 'cause that's a VER' big shoe 
 And you got a couple of beans and you don't have a clue? 
 You situation is bleek, I'ma keep it real cause 
 Fuckin' with me, you gotta drop a mill 
 'Cause if you gonna cop somethin' you gotta cop for real 
 Don't only talk it, walk like it - from the bricks to the booth 
 I could predict the future like Cleo the psychic 
 You can't date skee-os and wife it 
 And you can't sell me bullshit, we know the prices 
 So what your life is? 
 We gon' roll 'til the wheels fall off - y'all muh'fuckers check the tires 
 Off we go, let the trumpets blow 
 And hold on, because the driver of that Bentley is a pro 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Uhh, uhh 
 I, am, back, niggas 
 Feels good! Ha 
 Pah, holla at me! 
 The ruler's back 
 Yeah.. whoo! 
 Yeah.. yeah.. yeah.. 
  
 [Outro] 
 Now bounce, c'mon, bounce 
 Uhh, woo! Woo! 
 Bounce, c'mon, bounce

 Bounce, c'mon, bounce 
 Uhh, yeah, just my thoughts ladies and gentlemen 
 Just what I'm feelin at the time, you know what I mean?

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Fox Brown.. 
 Yeah, Jay-Z, what 
 I keep it fresher than the next, bitch 
 No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch 
 With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed 
 You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me 
 You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver 
 You got your own '96 somethin' to ride 
 And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why 
 You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin' 
 Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me 
 All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas 
 From the village to the telly 
 Time to kill it on your belly no question 
 Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence 
 They say sex is a weapon 
 So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds 
 Still poundin' in my afterlife 
 Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right? 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with ​​Jay-Z​​] 
 Ain't no nigga like the one I got 
 (No one can fuck you better) 
 Sleeps around but he gives me a lot 
 (Keeps you in diamonds and leathers) 
 Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone 
 ​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​ 
 (Tell the freaks to find a man of their own 
 Man of their own, man of their own) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fresh to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag 
 Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks 
 Got you a beeper to feel important 
 Surroundin' your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan 
 I keep you dove, but love 
 You know these hoes be makin' me weak 
 Y'all knows how it goes, B, and so I creep 
 I've been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken and 
 You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning 
 The chrome rim spinnin' keeps them grinnin' 
 So I run way the fuck up in 'em 
 And wrinkle they face like linen 
 I play hard until they say "God 
 He's keepin' it real, Jigga stay hard." 
 Lord, don't even trip, shit, I never slip 
 Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get 
 Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel 
 When you niggas play sick we can all get ill 
 Fox Brown.. (what the deal?) 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with ​​Jay-Z​​] 
 Ain't no nigga like the one I got 
 (No one can fuck you better) 
 Sleeps around but he gives me a lot

 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Ha, ha, right, right 
 Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie 
 Promise to stay monogamous, I try 
 But, love, you know these hoes be makin' me weak 
 Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep 
  
 [Verse 4: Foxy Brown] 
 What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes 
 Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs 
 Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga 
 So when you flip that coke 
 Remember the days you was dead broke 
 But now you style and I raised you, basically made you 
 Into a don, flippin' weight, her-on and shit 
 You know the pussy is all that 
 That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that 
 From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringin' bells 
 So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators 
 Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin' 
 On how I fuck the best and shit 
 Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys 
 Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis 
 I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life 
 Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was 
 I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters 
 Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas 
 And E classes with Mo in the glasses 
 Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's 
 Now all your mens is up in your Benz's 
 High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs 
 I never worry about them other chicks 
 'Cause you proved who was your wiz 
 When you was spendin' that bitch 
 I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin' 
 How you livin' large on the island? 
 All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home 
 Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks 
 Now we on the rise 
 Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes 
 Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit 
 Fucks no, I see half of that dough 
 Made you into a star, pushin' hundred-thousand-dollar cars 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with ​​Jay-Z​​] 
 Ain't no nigga like the one I got 
 (No one can fuck you better) 
 Sleeps around but he gives me a lot 
 (Keeps you in diamonds and leathers) 
 Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone

 [Intro: Pain In Da Ass] 
 Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground 
 I ain't panicked, I been here before 
 Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage 
 In front of that crowd 
 And showed them who was who, and what was what 
 Man look at these suckers 
 I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler 
 It just so happens that I know how to rap 
 OKAY, I'M RELOADED! 
  
 [Hook: Aaliyah] 
 A million 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas 
 Fucked up, right? Ha, I know 
 I know what y'all niggas asking yourself 
 Is he gon' ever fall off? 
 No... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 ... A lot of speculation on the monies I've made, honies I've slayed 
 How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid? 
 Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct 
 Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC? 
 What's the position you hold? 
 Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck 
 But only a single goin' gold? 
 If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold 
 Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O? 
 For the millionth time, asking me questions 
 Like Wendy Williams, harrassing me 
 Then get upset when I catch feelings 
 Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave 
 While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve 
 Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot? 
 Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block? 
 What you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses? 
 Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico 
 I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go 
 Now the question I ask you is, "How bad you wanna know?" 
 BLAOW! 
  
 [Hook: Aaliyah] 
 A million 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 Roc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh 
 Know my style 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more 
 'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw 
 My flow expose holes that they find in yours 
 Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores 
 But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours 
 Youngblood, you better get that, we frying because 
 Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse 
 And don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss 
 I used to be O.T., applyin' the force 
 Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss 
 Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross 
 I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be 
 Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V 
 I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me 
 And kiss my cold cheek 
 Chicks crying like I was Cochise 
 Tombstone read, "He was holdin' no leaks" 
 Started from the crack game and then so sweet 
 Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G 
 On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D 
 And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B 
 Me and my homie, started out co-d's 
 Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key 
 Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie' 
 Then I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on 
 Motherfuckers! 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Jigga, uh-huh, yeah

 Uhh, feel this[Produced by Bink!]

 [Verse] 
 Momma loved me, Pop left me 
 Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me 
 Eric fought me, made me tougher 
 Love you for that, my nigga; no matter what, bruh 
 Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong 
 Streets gave me all I write in this song 
 Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers 
 Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up 
 East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school 
 Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves 
 Momma raised me; Pop, I miss you 
 God, help me forgive him; I got some issues 
 Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair 
 Eric was fly... Shit, I used to steal his gear 
 I was the baby boy; I could do no wrong 
 Years going past fast; let's move along 
 Kitchen table: that's where I honed my skills 
 Jaz made me believe this shit was real 
 Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee 
 Clark sought me out, Dame believed 
 Primo laced me; Ski did too 
 Reasonable Doubt classic, shoulda went triple 
 Momma loved me, Pop left me 
 Grandma dressed me, plus she fed me 
 Banana pudding was in the hood then 
 Puffin on Ls, drinking pink Champale 
 Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot 
 Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked 
 Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up Hoff'? 
 B.I. hated the fact I put rap to the back 
 Money pouring in, clientele growing now 
 Birth of my first nephew; time to slow it down 
 October 21st: Lavelle came to the world 
 Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl 
 Momma loved me; Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay... 
 Loves you to death; won't let no trouble come your way 
 Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland 
 He's gone 'til November; how can I not remember? 
 Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra 
 And your son too—there's nothing I won't do 
 Unless you was me, how could you judge me? 
 I was brought up in pain; y'all can't touch me 
 Police pursued me; chased, cuffed, and subdued me 
 Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black 
 And living a movie, not living by rules 
 New rap patroling the city, follow my crews 
 Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say? 
 Your time is coming: you one hit away 
 Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game 
 To make the transition from the street to the fame 
 My momma loves me[Intro] 
 Stress... 
 Sunshine, shade, geyeah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I sold it all, from crack to opium 
 In third person, I don't wanna see 'em 
 So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em 
 From a remote location in the BM 
 Scopin' the whole situation, like, "Damn!" 
 Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream 
 But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean 
 It's difficult to read 'em 
 The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in 
 Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein' 
 Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in 
 Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars 
 This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars 
 Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna 
 Prayin' my people bailed out like Time/Warner 
 Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner 
 Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner 
 Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind 
 How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets? 
 (This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck) 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 This is the number one rule for your set 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 This is the number one rule for your set 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 If through our travels we get separated, never forget 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin' 
 In search of higher learnin' 
 Turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction 
 My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin' 
 Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin' 
 A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit 
 But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it 
 They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it 
 You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic 
 My hand got this pistol shakin' 
 'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and 
 Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him 
 Trapped, within this infrared dot 
 About to hot him and hit rock bottom 
 No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin' 
 My life found I got to live for the right now 
 Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands 
 Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 You used to hold me, told me that I was the best 
 Anything in this world I want I could possess 
 All that made me want is all that I could get 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 (When I was young) you used to hold me 
 Told me that I was the best 
 Anything in this world I want I could possess 
 All that made me want is all that I could get 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I found myself reminiscin', remember this one? 
 When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son 
 I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories 
 He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies 
 In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy 
 I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be 
 Remember Newton, mutual friend? 
 Well, me and him feudin', on your life I tried to talk to him 
 But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas 
 Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas 
 Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'? 
 I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin' 
 But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him 
 You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them 
 Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched 
 This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 This is the number one rule for your set 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 This is the number one rule for your set 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
 If through our travels we get separated, never forget 
 In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets 
  
 [Outro] 
 Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A-Fella y'all[Verse 1; Jay-Z] 
 Geah, yeah 
 Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up 
 Thirty odd years without having my cake up 
 So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year 
 I don't know why we here 
 Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair 
 Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road 
 Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov'?) 
 I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life 
 Colleek, are you praying for me? 
 See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way 
 If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay 
 For the sins of a father 
 So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays 
 In hopes that she'll be okay 
 And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare 
 I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Martin] 
 I hear my angels sing... 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Life is but a dream to me 
 Gun shots sing to these other guys 
 But lullabies don't mean a thing to me 
 I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying 
 Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian 
 I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace 
 Too busy letting my voice vibrate 
 Carving out my space in this world of fly girls 
 Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls 
 Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine 
 I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind 
 Some said: "Hov', how you get so fly?" 
 I said: "From not being afraid to fall out the sky" 
 My physical's a shell so when I say farewell 
 My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell 
 So have no fear, just know that 
 Life is but a beach chair 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z] 
 I hear my angels sing... 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Life is but a dream 
 Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice 
 Intercut, the winner's cup 
 With winters rough enough to interrupt life 
 That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice 
 This is Jay everyday, no compromise 
 No compass comes with this life just eyes 
 So to map it out you must look inside 
 Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica 
 Your corazón is what brought us home 
 In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricón, I am on 
 Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair 
 This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here 
 So 'til she's here, and she's declared 
 The heir, I will prepare 
 A blueprint for you to print 
 A map for you to get back 
 A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent 
 I'll make a stink for you to think 
 I ink these verses full of prose 
 So you won't get conned out of two cent 
 My last will and testament I leave my heir 
 My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair 
  
 [Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z] 
 I hear my angels sing... 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream 
 I hear my angels sing... 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up 
 (I hear my angels sing) 
 Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave 
 Life is but a dream

 If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, shorty is a Sidekick 
 She used to have a man, I used to have a side chick 
 Shorty got wind, I had to blow the chick off 
 She got rid of him, they both took the shit hard 
 Shorty played the piano, me I played with white keys 
 Shorty from the South, oh I think she like me 
 Shorty like Pac, me, Big Poppa 
 She screaming Hit 'Em Up, I'm screaming Who Shot Ya? 
 I'm on that red wine, shorty like white 
 Same shit, different toilet, we both getting nice 
 Me I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac 
 She's a PC, she lives in my lap 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Whether black or white, we both like Mike 
 We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight 
 I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch 
 Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch 
 Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man 
 Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can 
 Started at the window, end up at the wall 
 The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off 
 In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front 
 The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun 
 Both covered in gold like C3P0 
 James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater 
 We were supposed to Takeover, I caught her bumping Ether 
 I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince 
 Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since 
 My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros 
 Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero 
 We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq 
 Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back 
 Said I party too much, shorty got fed up 
 Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up 
 We used to make out, kissing each other's face off 
 Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard 
 Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars[Intro] 
 It's the Roc! Wooo! 
 Nike Airs is right (check) 
 My bucket is low (check) 
 My Rocawear is fittin' incredible

 Fuck it, I guess I got my swagger back 
 Mama, they said I killed a man 
 Well, I guess I got the dagger back 
 It's the Roc, bastards, we are BACK!

 Jigga Man, B. Sige to M-Easy (what up, fam?) 
 Oschino and Sparks and Freeweezy (holla!) 
 Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hey! 
 All I need is the love of my crew 
 The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through 
 And all I need is a chick that hold a jammy 
 Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uhh 
 Now understand we can't be stopped 
 From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops 
 Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty 
 A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?) 
 Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me 
 Better watch and observe me 
 And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar 
 I set fire to your empire 
 I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires 
 Yes I-ah, Jay I-ah... 
 Double G-A, livewire nigga, holla back! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I need...

 Couple chicks by my side, let's ride

 A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot (got those) 
 A sunny day some chicks that wanna play 
 And I'll be on my way 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Come on… now 
 All I need in this world of sin 
 Is me and my girlfriend! (ha ha) 
 I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue 
 When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!) 
 Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh) 
 A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch 
 Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!) 
 But no ad-libbin', nigga, stick to the script 
 Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer 
 'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you 
 And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew 
 Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue 
 In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucka to do 
 When I'm surrounded by squeal muh'fuckas like you? 
 But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew 
 R to the O to the C comin' true 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I need...

 [Verse 3] 
 Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong 
 Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone 
 Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all) 
 Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!) 
 The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith 
 Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe) 
 Any given Sunday gunplay's optional 
 However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waant it) 
 Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole 
 Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit 
 Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick 
 Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six 
 Now run along wit'cha little-ass hits 
 Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics! 
 Shut your bumba', got A-Rod numbers 
 All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk 
 When I blast the pump 
 I leave you relaxed in the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months 
 Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk 
 And flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps 
 We've got no respect, no law or governin' 
 Why you fuckin' with him? 
 Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them? 
 All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby 
  
 [Chorus]

 Uhh 
 She wants that old thing back 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 She want those Heroin tracks 
 She likes me 
 She fiends for me nightly 
 She leans for me 
 Morning, she rush for my touch 
 This is about lust 
 Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her 
 My presence is a must- must- must- 
 Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on 
 If I didn't when we cutting, the feeling'll be too strong 
 In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams 
 That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing 
 That Black Rain will take away your pain 
 Just for one night, baby, take me in vein 
 Now that feelin' got you tripping 
 You don't wanna feel no different 
 This here lust has got you itching 
 Nose wide open and it's dripping (eh, eh, eh, eh) 
 I know what you like, I am your prescription 
 I'm your physician, I'm your addiction

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I am so dope (uhh) 
 Like Louboutins with the red bottoms 
 You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em 
 Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me 
 It's so much fun, you shun therapy 
 Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting 
 Shopping's like copping, you constantly need it 
 I'm never around, you constantly seek it 
 You'll never be down, I know where your peak is 
 9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps 
 I keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself 
 Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!" 
 Like you better get help 
 But when that medicine's felt? 
 We're back together, don't ever leave me 
 Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me 
 My China White, 'til we D.O.A 
 Its Montega forever, baby, lets get away... 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell (Jay-Z)]

 Everything you love, DAMN! 
 (Baby you love ....HOV'!) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 How could you leave me? 
 I thought that you needed me! 
 When the world got too much and you pleaded with me 
 Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me! 
 How could you deny me so vehemently? 
 Now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me 
 And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me 
 And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me 
 Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D! 
  
 [Chorus: Pharrell (Jay-Z)] 
 (HOV'!) 
 And I know, and I know

 Just point out the bounce 
 Yes, just point out the bounce nigga 
 Yo, listen 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Rumor has it The Blueprint classic 
 Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden 
 So September 11th marks the era forever 
 Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera 
 Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers 
 Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em 
 Everybody loopin' up soul 
 It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov 
 Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy 
 See how we adjusted the game so easy 
 Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get 
 Like - oh shit, he's so handsome 
 Still in demand in the longest run standin 
 Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom 
 Can't one nigga get it back no rap 
 Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in 
 Large amounts 'til it's hard to count 
 Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce 
 To a whole ki to the R.O.C 
 Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga 
 Uhh, yeah, uhh 
 Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga 
 Uhh, I got y'all 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n 
 Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English 
 They only know what the single is, and single that out 
 To be the meaning of what he is about 
 And bein I'm about my business, not minglin' much 
 Runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin' 
 But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin' 
 The album width to keep the registers ringin' 
 In real life, I'm much more distinguished 
 I'm like a bloke from London, England 
 Jeah, you jinglin' baby 
 See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby 
 Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul 
 Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row 
 Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good 
 Slangin them O's like a real OG should 
 Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out, he's so hood 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in 
 Large amounts 'til it's hard to count 
 Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce 
 To a whole ki to the R.O.C 
 Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga 
 Uhh, yeah, uhh 
 Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga 
  
 [Verse 3: Kanye West] 
 Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star 
 Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star 
 Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps, we mobsters 
 Gingerbread Man even said, "You're a monster!" 
 Yeah, that's how I feel 
 To be down, you must appeal 
 To the crew, we're rated R 
 O.C., OG, Bobby Johnson son 
 Ask me, "Ray Ray, is that yo' car?" 
 I seen MTV, I know who you are 
 You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas? 
 I did take over the game, brought back the soul 
 Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold 
 Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow 
 All I, know, I gots to blow 
 And I don't play pause I'm from Chicago 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in 
 Large amounts 'til it's hard to count 
 Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce 
 To a whole ki to the R.O.C 
 Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga 
 Uhh, yeah, uhh 
 Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

 [Chorus: Sample] 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that 
 Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours 
 Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa 
 Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall 
 My brother from another pop, minus one shot 
 We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got 
 From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops 
 And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof 
 Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress 
 But look at us now man, we're young execs 
 My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty 
 My nigga High, my nigga Gotti 
 We embody all that’s right with the world 
 No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl 
 That's how we run, when you ain’t around 
 I'll spank ya son, keep him in line 
 If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine 
 God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I know Momma, your little baby 
 But these streets raised me crazy 
 Product of my environment, nothing can save me 
 Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb 
 For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed 
 For the most important lesson in life was when you said 
 "Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them" 
 Thanks for the days you kept me breathing 
 When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezin' 
 Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving 
 On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving 
 Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad 
 As a man, I apologize for my dad 
 When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do 
 That wasn’t the life meant for you 
 You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed 
 Everything that shines, everything that’s mine 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Check it out, uh, uh 
 Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad 
 And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad 
 Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad 
 I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab 
 If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad 
 Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody 
 Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man 
 Stand on your own two, do your shit man 
 The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores 
 Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you 
 Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view 
 You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass 
 Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said 
 Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed 
 You know my number when it’s code red 
 If you're wrong, my nigga 
 You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Sample] 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you 
 I'd risk everything 
 For one kiss, everything 
 Yes I'd do anything (Anything?) 
 Anything for you[Produced by Just Blaze]

 [Verse] 
 The theme song to The Sopranos 
 Plays in the key of life on my mental piano 
 Got a strange way of seein' life like 
 I'm Stevie Wonder with beads under the doo-rag 
 Intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah 
 Knowin' I can go just switchin' a spare 
 On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight 
 Oh! Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches 
 Every time somebody like Ennis was mentioned 
 I would turn green, me bein' in the trenches 
 Him livin' adventurous, not worryin' about expenditures 
 I'm bravin' temperatures below zero, no hero 
 No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga 
 But I'm starvin', my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure 
 Is startin' to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver 
 Watch it my niggas, I'm tryin' to be calm but I'm gon' get richer 
 Through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture 
 Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures 
 Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas 
 Tattooed, so I carry on like I'm non-religious 
 Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures 
 Niggas, say it's the dawn, but I'm superstitious 
 Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin' has gone as you predicted 
 I move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas actin' too suspicious 
 This is, food for thought—you do the dishes![Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Haters, haters; these niggas is haters 
 And I made myself so easy to love 
  
 [Verse 1: Kanye West] 
 How much they hate it? very! 
 Kiss girls like Katy Perry 
 I am never sprung, but I Spring 'er, Jerry 
 Don’t try this at home: results may vary 
 King like T.I., but in the Chi, Larry... 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Hoover, Hova 
 Both are American Gangsters 
 You choose who's colder 
 Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser 
 I can’t even stomach myself, ulcer! 
 More realer 'cause I'm closer 
 Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to 
 Poser, no sir 
 My hustle, so Russell, I stretch work, yoga 
 You know I got it down, dog 
 Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off 
 It ain’t nothing for me to knock some nouns off 
 At these MCs praying for my downfall 
 They just haters, I wave at you, I’m so player

 We killing the game, it's not fair

 Nigga, pee-une, pee-une, pee-une 
 Get back, gimme room room room

 Young Hov', what we doin', doin', doin'? 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 We ballin', bitches 
 Eating y'all food, leaving dishes 
 Why these niggas always talking Lear talk, 'Ye? 
 Why I never see 'em at the Clearport, 'Ye? 
 Why always hear they at the airport? 
 While I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force? 
 Therefore, please stop talking my ears off 
 Millionaire talk 
 You haters, you mad at me 'cause your paper 
 Need to get its motherfucking weight up 
 Hold up, wait up, I ain’t done 
 Name one thing I ain’t done 
 It hurts when you say that I ain't the one 
 You haters, how do I gain your favor? 
 I need to know 'cause I care 
 I need you to love me, I swear, look here! 
 See 'Ye is running the Chi like Gale Sayers 
 I'm running New York, I got the mayor on my pager 
 You can’t fade us, you haters

 [Intro: Sauce Money] 
 Ayo, Jay, word up 
 These motherfuckers fucking talking 
 That comeback shit like they cooking crack 
 Shit, I ain't fronting 
 All I want my pockets green like slum change 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, motherfucker, for real 
 With no trace of AIDS 
 We keep our pockets fully blown 
 Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga 
  
 [Verse 1: Sauce Money] 
 Ayo, we patting down pussy from Sugar Hill to the Shark Bar 
 Fuck a bitch D in the marked car 
 We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen 
 Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing 
 You cling we do our thing and bring 
 Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing 
 East coast host is hostile colossal 
 Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles 
 Al Pacino down to Nino Brown 
 Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino 
 Teflon, make sure your jammy is full 
 'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull 
 Tropical leaves where I got a few keys 
 With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese 
 Said we was garbage, so fuck college 
 Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars 
 Star studded bitches with crystals 
 Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss 
 I drop the stellar, even acapella 
 I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella 
  
 [Chorus: Fat Joe sample] 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms 
 In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe 
 I cream, I diamond gleam 
 High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop 
 Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam 
 Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans 
 Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene 
 In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean 
 Liaison for days on end 
 Money make the world go around so I made some to spend 
 Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow 
 Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig 
 Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo 
 That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto 
 Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson 
 I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano 
 You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns 
 Horizontal, get your weight up, I am 
 Two point two pounds 
 You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams 
 Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money 
 Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish 
 Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck? 
  
 [Chorus: Fat Joe] 
 Bring it on if you think you can hang 
  
 [Verse 3: Big Jaz] 
 Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit 
 Pure platinum fetish for cheddars 
 Spread lettuce heroes get deadish 
 I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes 
 You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal 
 John Stockton couldn't assist you 
 Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N 
 So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga 
 Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished 
 Spanking dollars with the commas 
 Banging bitches out the Bahamas 
 On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther 
 Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana 
 Absence of malice in my palace 
 Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus 
 Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance 
 Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me 
 Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams 
 Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams 
 Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream 
  
 [Chorus: Fat Joe sample] 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang 
 And if not then let me do my thing 
 Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Bring it on, if you think, if you think, if you think[Produced by DJ Quik] 
  
 [Intro: JAY-Z] 
 Uhh, this feel right right here, Quik 
 It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here 
 Young! God damn 
 Let me justify my thug on this one right here 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc 
 Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc 
 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, the party 'bout to pop 
 Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot 
 And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga 
 To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself 
 I will never tell, even if it means sittin' in a cell 
 I ain't never ran, never will 
 I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands 
 To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt 
 I never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself 
 Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth 
 Death before dishonor and I tell you what else 
 I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help 
 Foolish pride is what held me together through the years 
 I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself 
 I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt 
 Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail 
 But I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself 
 If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell 
 'Til it's heaven 
  
 [Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson] 
 Justify my thug for you 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 To justify my thug 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 For you 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat 
 Just the unwritten laws in rap, know that 
 For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin' 
 Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine 
 Don't be actin like you can't see street action 
 Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time 
 You see my mind's on the finish line, facin' the wreck 
 I put my muh'fuckin' faith in the TEC, tell Satan not yet 
 You understand I am chasin' my breath 
 I am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes 
 I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster 
 Travellin' Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God 
 God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you 
 Until, I won this race, then eventually 
 My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me 
 However it turns out fine, red line! 
  
 [Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson] 
 Justify my thug for you 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 To justify my thug 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 For you 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight 
 And two wrongs don't make a right 
 But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life 
 At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?) 
 'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his 
 Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half 
 Bet that stops all the grinnin' and the laughs 
 When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag 
 When your options is none and the pen is all you have 
 Or the block, niggas standin' tight as lemons on the ave 
 Tryin' to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin' in the cash 
 But can't put they name on paper 'cause, then you on blast 
 Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence 
 Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us 
 Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up 
 Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up? 
  
 [Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson] 
 Justify my thug for you 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 To justify my thug 
 My thug (hoping) 
 My thug (praying) for you 
 For you[Intro] 
 It was all a dream 
  
 [Refrain: Faith Evans] 
 Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racin through my head 
 Felt so real to me, this is what was said 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 "Had a dream," I said; "Bout who?" he said 
 "'Bout B.I.G.," I said; "That's big," he said 
 "Dig what he said"; "Proceed," he said 
 "Indeed," I said, so, breathe I did 
 "Don't repeat what I say," I said, he said nothing 
 He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this 
 What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said 
 "It came to me like a whisper last evening," I said 
 "What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said 
 First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead 
 "Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'" better believe it," he said 
 "Careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said 
 "I see," I said, "jealousy" I said 
 "Got the whole industry mad at me," I said 
 Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself: 
 Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!" 
 "I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self" 
 Getting stoned every day like Jesus did 
 "What he said," I said, "has been said before" 
 "Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more" 
  
 [Refrain: Faith Evans] 
 Was it all a dream - tell me 
 Was it all a dream, was it a dream 
 Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam 
 I gotta know (It was all a dream) 
 Was it all a dream - was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream, a dream 
 Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam 
  
 [Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.] 
 It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine 
 Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
 Hanging pictures on my wall 
 Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
 I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped 
 Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock 
 Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
 With the hat to match 
 Remember Rapping Duke, "duh-ha, duh-ha" 
 You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far 
 Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight 
 Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade) 
 Born sinner, the opposite of a winner 
 Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner 
 Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri 
 Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky 
 I'm blowing up like you thought I would 
 Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good 
 And if you don't know, now you know, nigga 
  
 [Refrain: Faith Evans] 
 Was it all a dream - tell me 
 Was it all a dream, was it a dream 
 Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam 
 I gotta know (It was all a dream) 
 Was it all a dream - was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream, a dream 
 Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z (spoken)] 
 "I see," I said, "jealousy" I said 
 "Got the whole industry mad at me," I said 
 Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself: 
 Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!" 
 "I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self" 
 Getting stoned every day like Jesus did 
 "What he said," I said, "has been said before" 
 "Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"[Intro] 
 You ain't got enough stamps in ya passport 
 To fuck with Young H-O (heheheh)

 The maturation of Jay-Zeezy, heh 
 Check me out

 30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hot still (uhh) 
 Better broad, better automobile (uhh) 
 Bet a yard (naw!) bet a hundred mil 
 That by the song's end I'll probably start another trend 
 I know everything you wan' do 
 I did all that by the age of 21 
 By 22, I had that brand new Ac' coupe 
 I guess you could say that my legend just begun 
 I'm, young enough to know the right car to buy 
 Yet grown enough not to put rims on it 
 I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me 
 And I didn't even have to put tints on it 
 I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch 
 I don't buy out the bar, I bought the nightspot 
 I got the right stock 
 I, got, stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops 
 I know you're like "Fuck! This is child abuse, call DYFS!"

 You young boys ain't ready for real 
 30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still 
  
 [Hook] 
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 I used to play the block like that (like that) 
 I used to carry knots like that (like that) 
 Now I got black cards, good credit and such 
 Baby boy cause I'm all grown up, taha!

 30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still 
 These young boys is like fire drills (uhh)

 Gotta stop playin' with these children (chea) 
 I'm a bully with the bucks (boots) 
 Don't let the patent leather shoes fool you youngin' 
 I got the fully in the tux 
 That was my past, now I'm so grown up 
 I don't got one gun on me 
 Gotta a sum on me to hire a gun army, get ya spun like laundry 
 And I'll be somewhere under palm trees, calmly listenin' to R&B 
 When we get the call he's, no longer with us, fire ya babysitters 
 You little fucks fall back for real 
 30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still 
  
 [Hook] 
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 I used to wear my hoodie like that (like that) 
 Five deep in a hooptie like that (like that) 
 Now I got black cards, good credit and such 
 Baby boy cause I'm all grown up, heheheh 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day 
 Y'all youngins chase, I'm Patronin' it straight 
 I like South Beach but I'm in St. Tropez 
 Y'all drink Dom but not Rosé (hey) 
 Ya chick shop at the mall 
 My chick burnin' down Bergdorf's 
 Comin' back with Birkin bags 
 Ya chick is like, "What type of purse is that?" 
 I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch 
 You from the era where snitchin' is the shit 
 I'm afraid of the future (why?) 
 Y'all respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter 
 Y'all go to parties to ice grill 
 I go to parties to party with nice girls 
 Young boys gotta chill 
 30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still 
  
 [Hook] 
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I'm all grown up 
 Ya, we used to ball like that (like that) 
 Now we own the ball team, holla back (holla back)

 [Verse 1] 
 They say "Hola Hovito!" 
 That's what they sayin' when I ROLL UP with my PEOPLE 
 My music bangin' like them vatos locos got rap in a choke hold 
 And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland 
 Callate la boca, my baby 
 All I want to do is stroke you all crazy 
 My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches 
 Mami keep comin' back 'cause mami came vicious 
 Catch Hov' in the drop, nasty thang, lane switchin' 
 Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missin' 
 "Bujando, bujando!" - the cops is comin' 
 Got that rap patrol behind, yo: get to runnin' 
 I'm unstoppable Hov', untoppable flows 
 I'm the compadre, the Sinatra of my day 
 Ol' Blue Eyes my nigga, "I did it my way" 
 If y'all not rollin' with Hov' then hit the highway 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!" 
 Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin' 
 Put it down for my people 
 "Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!" 
 Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin' 
 Put it down for my people 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.- 
 Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old 
 Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil 
 Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you 
 One life to live - notice you get no sequel 
 So I truly got to live this like my last movie 
 6 oohie, jewels drippin', big tooly 
 I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie 
 And with the third pick, I made the earth sick 
 M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect 
 I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter 
 Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic 
 Because my mind's quicker 
 I'm a '88er, 9-6 to Reasonable Doubt 
 Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out 
 Yeah you shinin', but the only thing you're leavin' out 
 You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!" 
 Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin' 
 Put it down for my people

 [Verse 3] 
 Hold up; naw muh'fuckers - y'all muh'fuckers 
 Better run to the post office and get a job, muh'fuckers 
 Or starve muh'fuckers, 'cause Jay's been the only one 
 Eatin' thus far, sub-par muh'fuckers 
 Naw even though y'all hate, I love y'all muh'fuckers 
 Friend or Foe y'all all my muh'fuckers 
 If you haven't heard, I'm Michael, Magic and Bird 
 All rolled in one - 'cause none got more flows than Young 
 Plus got more flows to come 
 And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one 
 So move over - hoes, choose Hova 
 My food for thought so hot it give you dudes ulcers 
 Rovers, roasters, poseurs 
 Gettin' it in with me, livin' like they supposed to 
 Watches, chain, front row at the game 
 Sold out arena, all screamin' my name, c'mon! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!" 
 Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin' 
 Put it down for my people 
 "Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!" 
 Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin' 
 Put it down for my people[Verse 1] 
 Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote 
 Speeches I prepared that I never spoke 
 Words on a paper that I never read 
 Proses never penned, they stayed in my head 
 Jotted on dotted lines, "I'ma fight you, nigga" 
 From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga 
 Must've been some pain in your past, too 
 Must've been a karma that was past due 
 Must it be the energy that passed through 
 Must've been a pastor, many snafus 
 Started a good man, you married my mama 
 I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer 
 She had two kids from a previous mister 
 One family, I don't believe in half-sisters 
 Never treated my brother like a step, Pop 
 Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out 
  
 [Chorus] 
 What was you preparing us— 
 For? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Did you see the runt as the front-runner 
 Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins 
 What ancestors did you summon to the summit 
 To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em 
 The tsunamis that I swum in to become in 
 Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in 
 Unc in a better place but you couldn't function 
 Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured 
 I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming 
 You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something 
 You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands 
 You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans 
 Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had 
 Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that 
 I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past 
 I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap 
  
 [Chorus] 
 What was you preparing us— 
 For?[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 (Watcher!) 
 Jeah.. uhh.. 
 Shit I do for a livin', nigga 
 Shit I eat for a livin', nigga (Watcher!) 
 That's how I live for a livin', nigga... (Watchin'!) 
 Okay, let's do this 
 (The watcher!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Things just ain't the same for gangstas 
 But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters 
 All of these rap singers claimin' they bangers 
 Doin' all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers 
 Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners 
 I was doin' this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers 
 I was movin' them grams 
 'Fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was 
 Duckin' the vans, radars, the scanners 
 Before you knew what "hard," "white," or "tan" was 
 I was hittin' the turnpike, aight with the bammers 
 I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers 
 I was prickin' my finger 'fore you knew what a "fam" was 
 I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was 
 Three hundred mil' later, now you understand us 
 Y'all ain't see us comin' through Vegas 
 You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night 
 Grand fucked up one fight, I was on the Peter Pan bus 
 You was puttin' Peter Pan up in your room 
 Y'all fuckin' with whom? 
 Allow me to retort 
 You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught 
 You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report 
 'Bout a high speed Porsche 
 I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss 
 'Til I came through the door 
 Like Eric B. for Pres, respect me in this bitch! 
 You can't disrespect us, ‘cause you got a little check cut 
 You was suckin' 'em so long, fuckin' your little neck up 
 Now you too big for your britches 
 You got a few little bitches 
 You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous 
 I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game 
 It's only right I got the right to be king 
 Niggas that got life really like what I sing 
 ‘Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain 
 Know the shit I don't write 
 Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game 
 Word to the hyphen in my name! 
 J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa 
 The past, present, nigga the future, proper 
 The holy trinity of hip-hop is us 
 We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops 
 It's the Roc! 
  
 [Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri] 
 I know 
 You got your eyes on me 
 I feel you watching me 
 But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me 
 You try 
 But what you think you saw 
 Ain't what you thought you saw 
 You better off not looking at all 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before 
 People I used to know just don't know me no more 
 But everywhere that I go, I got people I know 
 Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low 
  
 [Verse 2: Dr. Dre] 
 I'm still on top of the game 
 Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim 
 Still at the top, had to rock for the fame 
 Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came 
 You seen it all, how I got, how I gained 
 The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain 
 When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim 
 The streets; they made a special spot for my name 
 Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign 
 But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins 
 The pride and the pain 
 All the way back from the rise of my name 
 See the world clear through the eyes of the man 
 See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave 
 When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane 
 The odds that I played 
 The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher 
  
 [Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri] 
 I know 
 You got your eyes on me 
 I feel you watching me 
 But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me 
 You try 
 But what you think you saw 
 Ain't what you thought you saw 
 You better off not looking at all 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before 
 People I used to know just don't know me no more 
 But everywhere that I go, I got people I know 
 Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low 
  
 [Verse 3: Rakim] 
 I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphic things 
 It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends 
 It's like watchin' a movie through a panoramic screen 
 Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene 
 Cash is the topic; the object? A fatter pocket 
 Some take the crack and chop it 
 But those that haven't got it take away to add a profit 
 It's catastrophic, I take the gat and cock it 
 And I'll sit back and watch it 
 These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully 
 The world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me 
 Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny 
 In the place where the number-one cause of death is money 
 You can try copin' 
 I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken 
 I'm still alive and scopin' 
 Be 'nother hundred years 'til my skies close in 
 And I'ma die with my eyes open: The Watcher! 
  
 [Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri] 
 I know 
 You got your eyes on me 
 I feel you watching me 
 But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me 
 You try 
 Vut what you think you saw 
 Ain't what you thought you saw 
 You better off not looking at all 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before 
 People I used to know just don't know me no more 
 But everywhere that I go, I got people I know 
 Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low[Intro: JAY-Z] 
 Yeah, uh 
 Vacay the pain away, uh 
 Smoking the pain away, uh 
 Drinking the–uh 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Look at all we been through since last August 
 Skating through the rumors like, "Aw, shit!" 
 Still came back, fucked up the red carpet 
 Shows how big your heart is 
 On the Run, we took a hundred together 
 More than the money, it was the fact that we done it together 
 Uh, healing in real time 
 Song Cry to Resentment, that was real crying 
 Bonnie and Clyde things, we hold it down 
 Had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime 
 Got through it, got blessed times two with it 
 New Bel-Air estates with four pools in it 
 I told my bro, "You gotta go home," over vino 
 Goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't Casino 
 Cost him two mill' plus the child support 
 We'll get the money back, but not the child support 
 It's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes 
 Woulda broke me down had you got away 
 It woulda broke me up, you took my child away 
 I'm glad we found a way 
 Sexin' the pain away 
 Vacay the pain away 
 Drinking the pain away 
 Smoking the pain away 
  
 [Verse 2: James Blake & JAY-Z] 
 Too perfect not to wonder (yeah) 
 If we created a flame that would warm us 'til it’s over 
 We invented lovers from company for the summer 
 I was many faces, but at least I was willing to change 
 I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone 
 Shit feels so beautiful, don't you agree? 
 I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone 
  
 [Beat Change] 
  
 [Interlude: JAY-Z] 
 Our external reality is an opportunity to heal our internal upset 
 Let's build a cathedral these evils couldn't fuck with 
 I wanna spend my Saturdays and my latter-days 
 Eating sundaes and enjoying Mondays 
 Not worrying about what none say 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 Yoncé, all on this mouth like liquor 
 Uh, that my nigga, uh, that my nigga 
 Over everything, each of our mood swings 
 Whenever attitudes change, like a mood ring 
 Ain't nothing like somebody that get ya, baby, I get ya 
 Let's go through this thing, come out stronger, the golden journey 
 Broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi 
 You're fine china, I'm a bull and ball in a china shop 
 I promise to repair with gold each bowl I drop 
 Be grateful for whatever comes because each has been sent 
 From a guy from beyond, that's what Rumi say 
 "Never go to bed mad," that's what my Ummi say 
 It always took her less to say more 
 I always thought she was an angel, now I'm sure, sure[Produced by Sean C, LV, Diddy] 
  
 [Intro: Denzel Washington from American Gangster] 
 Most important thing in business is honesty, integrity 
 Hard work, family 
 Never forgetting where we came from 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back 
 Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back 
 Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home 
 Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at 
 A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all 
 Burned it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at 
 Flash back, not having much, not having that 
 Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and 
 Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack 
 And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat 
 Own boss, own your masters, slaves 
 The mentality I carry with me to this very day 
 Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we? 
 If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me 
  
 [Hook] 
 And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm so fa sho', it's no facade 
 "Stay outta trouble", momma said as momma sighed 
 Her fear: her youngest son be a victim of homicide 
 But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma, die ...inside 
 And either way, you lose me momma so let loose of me 
 I got the rein our direction will soon change 
 To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game 
 Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, I hustle music 
 But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick 
 Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift 
 Weight like I'm using 'roids 
 Rolls-Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering 
 Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in 
 Choices, we make trying to escape, shit 
  
 [Hook] 
 And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This is not for commercial usage 
 Please don't categorize this as music 
 Please don't compare me to other rappers 
 Compare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris 
 And Luda's my dude, I ain't trying to diss 
 Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch 
 I'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'ma get 
 I'ma live and die with the decisions that I'ma pick 
 So fuck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak 
 Made men ain't supposed to make statements 
 End of the story, I followed the code, cracked the safe 
 Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate 
 Leave that boy Hov' alone, why don't cha? 
 You don't have to if you don't want to 
 But don't say I didn't warn ya 
  
 [Hook] 
 Oh... and I don't need no hook for this shiiiit[Produced by Kanye West and No I.D.] 
  
 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Blueprint, trois 
 Yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 What we talkin' about? Real shit, or we talkin' about rhymes? 
 You talkin' about millions, or you talkin' about mine? 
 What we talkin' about? 'Cause I ain't got time 
 For what people be talkin' about all the time 
 What we talkin' about? Fiction, or we talkin' about fact? 
 You talkin' about fiction? Hold up, pardon my back 
 I'm talkin' about life, and all I hear is 
 "Oh yeah, he keeps talkin' about crack." 
 I ain't talkin' about profit, I'm talkin' about pain 
 I'm talkin' about despair, I'm talkin' about shame 
 I ain't talkin' about gossip, I ain't talkin' about Game 
 I ain't talkin' about Jimmy, I ain't talkin' about Dame 
 I'm talkin' about real shit, them people playin' 
 What is you talkin' about? I don't know what y'all sayin' 
 People keep talkin' about "Hov, take it back!" 
 I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that? 
 Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap 
 About worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat 
 Talkin' about revenge while carryin' his casket 
 All teary-eyed, about to take it to a mattress 
 I'm talkin' about music, I ain't talkin' about rap 
 You talkin' about who's hot, I ain't talkin' about that 
 The conversation is changed, let's yap about that 
 I don't run rap no more, I run the map 
  
 [Chorus: Luke Steele & (Jay-Z)] 
 They talk, we live 
 We see what they say, they say, they say 
 (I see what y'all talkin' about, ha ha) 
 They talk, we did 
 Who cares what they say, they say, they say? 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' about me 
 Talkin' about what I wear, talkin' about where I be 
 Check out my hair: these ain't curls, these is peas 
 "Peasey head" still get paid, I'm combin' through G's 
 Please, we ain't focused on naps 
 'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map 
 A small part of the reason the President is black 
 I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack 
 Talkin' about progress, I ain't lookin' back 
 You know I run track; try not to get lapped 
 People keep talkin' about "Hov left 'em flat." 
 Try to rewrite history, let's talk about facts 
 Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps 
 He could've made more, but he ain't sign his contract 
 As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack 
 That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack 
 Grown men want me to sit 'em on my lap 
 But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black 
 I repeat, you can't sit on my lap 
 I don't have a beard, now get off my sack—scream at me! 
  
 [Chorus: Luke Steele & (Jay-Z)] 
 They talk, we live 
 We see what they say, they say, they say 
 They talk, we did 
 Who cares what they say, they say, they say? 
 (Blueprint 3) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 And now that that's that, let's talk about the future 
 We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther 
 Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer 
 Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up 
 Or you could come with me to the White House, get your suit up! 
 You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up 
 Peace out Medusa 
 Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah 
 Tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor 
 Tooter of my own horn, beep beep, moo-ya 
 Rass clot when rude boy come through with the roof up 
 So I could see the sky 
 'Cause everybody talkin' Hov, I think we know why 
  
 [Chorus: Luke Steele] 
 They talk, we live 
 We see what they say, they say, they say 
 They talk, we did 
 Who cares what they say, they say, they say?[Intro: Marvin Gaye] 
 Dreamed of you this morning 
 Then came the dawn, and 
 I thought you were here with me 
 If you could only see 
 How much I love you 
 That's all, that's all baby 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never, felt that before 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never, felt that before 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never, felt that before 
 But there's always; that's all, that's all baby 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, uhh! 
 This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out 
 Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out 
 Seems as our plans to get a grant 
 Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out 
 We need it now, we need a town 
 We need a place to pitch, we need a mound 
 For now, I'm just a lazy boy 
 Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy 
 In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin 
 Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard 
 But that's too far away, niggas are starving 
 Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target 
 I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows 
 I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose 
 I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those 
 Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow 
  
 [Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)] 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (I'm just American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 But there's always, that's all, that's all baby 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Uh, uhhhh! 
 Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there 
 It's not quite near, and it's not like we're 
 Professionals, moving the decimals 
 Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No! 
 Who in the F knows how to be successful 
 Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode 
 They say its celestial, it's all in the stars 
 Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards 
 'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are 
 At all costs better avoid these bars 
 Now let's start, on your mark 
 Get set, let's go, get out the car 
 Going in circles it's a vicious cycle 
 This is a crash course, this ain't high school 
 Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again 
 Your own reality show, the season begins 
  
 [Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)] 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (I'm just American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 But there's always, that's all, that's all baby 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects 
 And head to the heights where big coke is processed 
 You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct 
 Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English 
 If he takes a liking after a couple of trips 
 And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment 
 You're now in a game where only time can tell 
 Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up 
 Survive the droughts? I wish you well? 
 How sick am I? I wish you health 
 I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth 
 I wish you insight so you could see for yourself 
 You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming 
 And the cops is coming, you could read they mind 
 You could see from behind, you could redefine 
 The game as we know it, one dream at a time 
 I'm, American dreamin' 
  
 [Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)] 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (I'm just American dreamin') 
 Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way 
 I never felt that before 
 (American dreamin') 
 But there's always, that's all, that's all baby

 Turn the lights all the way down 
 What, uh-huh yeah

 Come on (GGRRRRRR) 
 Come on yeah come on 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, yo 
 J-A-Y, I flow sick 
 Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick 
 I spits the game for those that throw bricks 
 Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks 
 Sex, murder and mayhem - romance for the street 
 Only wife of mines is a life of crime 
 And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests 
 How can I not flirt with death? 
 That's life's enigma, long as life's within us 
 We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us 
 Fuck it! 
 Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas 
 Y'all can't floss on my level 
 I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter 
 When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture 
 If you get close enough, you can read the scripture 
 It reads: money, cash, hoes, how real was that nigga? What! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)] 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)

 Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon) 
 Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch 
 Yeah I rap now, fast money done slowed up 
 Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck 
 Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?) 
 Us the villains? Fuck your feelings 
 While y'all playa hate we in the upper millions 
 What's the dealings? (huh) It's like New York's been soft 
 Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings 
 I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing 
 More money, more cash, more chilling 
 I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song 
 Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song 
 Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam took on the world 
 Shit, I led a life you can write a book on 
 Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street 
 Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)] 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon) 
 Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!) 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)

 [Verse 3: DMX] 
 D-M-X and my dogs bite 
 Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night 
 Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit 
 Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen 
 When we clap shit 
 Acting like we owe 'em something 
 Then we show 'em something 
 Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh) Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood 
 Is like fucking with a mad dog that wasn't fed food 
 And the only thing that's stopping him is you (WHAT!) 
 So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (WHAT!) 
 Chopping in two (COME ON!) 
 Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street: 
 This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!) 
 But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas 
 I shed blood, for my niggas 
 Let a nigga holla, "where my niggas?" 
 All I'ma hear is "right here my nigga!" 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)] 
 Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)

 [Interlude: Pain In Da Ass] 
 Okay okay okay, so now the guy's working for Jay-Z 
 Making hot songs 
 But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z 
 Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z 
 But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what 
 Not selling any records, fuck you pay me 
 Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me 
 No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me 
 And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label? 
 You can't sell any singles in the stores? 
 You light a match....you blow the joint *explosion*[Intro: Kelly Price (Jay-Z)] 
 Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh) 
 No matter what I've done (right) 
 You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah) 
 Through all things (yeah) 
 For that I am eternally grateful 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt 
 Play those video games, stole change from ya purse 
 Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt 
 Saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk 
 All you did was motivate me, "Don't let 'em hold you back" 
 What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack 
 I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame 
 Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame 
 You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world 
 And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse 
 I hated me and everybody that created crack 
 Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat 
 Still haven't apologized, so please play this back 
 While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act 
 You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain 
 All I did was think about how the funds once came 
 Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain 
 How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came 
 That's a savage, you're the reason 
 Why me and these beats make a marriage 
 Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit 
 Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me 
 Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be 
 You must love me 
  
 [Chorus: Kelly Price] 
 You must love me... 
 Say that you love me 
 All I know say that you must love me 
 Ohh yeah 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 We used to fight every night but I never would suffer 
 Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher 
 As we grew fussing and fighting continued 
 As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school 
 Got intense, real intense as we got older 
 Never believed it would lead to me poppin' one in your shoulder 
 Where my rings? Knew you had it 'cause you took too long 
 As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on 
 Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside 
 Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride 
 Made our way down the steps 
 Maybe you thought it was just a threat 
 Or maybe ya life was just that crazy 
 And you was beggin' for death 
 Try to justify this in my young mind 
 But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined 
 Drove me berzerk, saw the devil in your eyes 
 High off more than weed 
 Confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed 
 What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time 
 To see ya stumbling to the ground 
 Damn! what the fuck I done now? 
 Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out 
 Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house 
 Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga 
 And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga 
 Left the scene, how could I go out that way? 
 Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day 
 You must love me 
  
 [Chorus: Kelly Price] 
 You must love me... 
 What after all the wrong I've done 
 I know you must 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Everything in my power and within my frame 
 To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game 
 But you was one of the few people that I can trust 
 And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us 
 You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go 
 Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no 
 When it was one of those days when nobody was around 
 And I needed emergency trip out of town 
 Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know 
 As you stared in my face asking me could you go 
 I agreed said send her everything'll go smooth 
 Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through 
 Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane 
 Couldn't explain these strange feeling that I caught in the vein 
 I'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right 
 I'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life 
 You must've love me 
  
 [Chorus: Kelly Price] 
 ("You must love me" repeats in background) 
 After everything that I've done wrong 
 I know inside you must love me 
 I know that you love me 
 You showed me I know it 
 I know 
 Say that you love me 
 Say that you love me 
 I know you must love me 
 Oh yes you do 
 Inside I know it 
 You've always shown it 
 You love me yea yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 I know that you love me[Intro: Jay-Z (Timbaland)] 
 Welcome 
 To the future, uhh (Blueprint, 3, ay-ay, oh, hey-hey) 
 Hey, count me in (Blue-print, 3, ay, hey, hey-hey) 
 Find me a nice soft place to land (I got you Hov', ay ay-ay) 
 I'm so high (yeah, hey hey, hey, hey, c'mon) 
 Find me a place to land

 Yeah, right there, yeah (fricky-fricky Hov')

 I'm so tomorrow the Audemar says yesterday 
 Which means you on time delay 
 So even if I slow it dowwwwwn 
 My sound is fast forward, hold up 
 I'm just a runway show 
 But I wear that so my plane, these my runway clothes 
 Hehe, Cashmere sweats 
 They come out next year but these my last year sweats 
 And my ho's so sick 
 Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch 
 And you know this shit 
 I'm professional, they novices 
 I just may let you borrow this 
 This the Blueprint, nigga follow this 
 This what what tomorrow is 
 Welcome to tomorrow BIIIIIIIIIII 
  
 [Chorus: Drake (Jay-Z)] 
 Whatever you about to discover we off that 
 You about to tell her you love her we off that 
 Always wanna fight in the club and we off that 
 But you can't bring the future back, back 
 Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that 
 Oversized clothes and chains we off that

 (And we still makin money 'cause we still on that)

 This ain't black vs. white, my nigga we off that 
 Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back 
 Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls 
 It's 2010, not 1864 
 Uhh, yeah we come so far 
 So I drive around town, hard top and it's off 
 Uhh, in my TriBeCa loft 
 With my high brow art, and my high yellow broad 
 Uhh, and my dark-skinned sis 
 And my best white mate, say what's up to Chris 
 Uhh, how's that for a mix? 
 Got a black president, got green presidents 
 "Blueprint's" in my white iPod 
 Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God 
 Uhh, we ain't tripping off that 
 This a Benetton ad, nigga been up off that, uhh

 You used to move, what you used to do 
 And I don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches 
 That you used to screw, what your future do 
 And we don't really care what you used to say 
 Unless that affects your future pay 
 I'm on a practice field runnin' Two-A-Days 
 So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way 
 So I don't give a fidduck abiddout the shit 
 That you probably did, who you probably is 
 The only time I deal in past tense 
 'Cause I'm past rims, and I'm past tints 
 If you drivin' it, I drove it 
 You got it, 'cause I sold it 
 You copped it, I bought it back 
 And we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that

 Yeah, so what if you flip a couple words? 
 I could triple that in birds 
 Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky 
 I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies 
 No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy 
 And just like a b-boy with 360 waves

 Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar 
 Whip it around, it still comes back hard 
 So easily do I W-H-I-P

 Who slipped, became prisoners, trees taped to the visitors 
 You already know what the bidness is 
 Unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit 
 Niggas wanna bring the 80s back 
 That's okay with me, that's where they made me at 
 Except I don't write on the wall 
 I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall 
 Nah, I don't spin on my head 
 I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread

 Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together 
 Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain

 Blame Reagan for making me into a monster 
 Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra 
 I ran contraband that they sponsored 
 Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

 Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds 
 Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth 
 Niggas said, "Bryan leave your cousin in the house" 
 Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out 
 While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros 
 Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough 
 No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid 
 What's in the bank? Shoot it 
 Lose it like I ain't do it 
 You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank fluid?

 As if, now everybody's senile on me

 I felt so inspired by what my teacher said 
 Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head 
 Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids 
 Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class 
 I'll teach his ass, even better's what my uncle did 
 I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head 
 Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his 
 He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list 
 It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head 
 He gon' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge 
 And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick 
 Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread 
 Spread, spread

 Father is too far away to father 
 Further-more all the kids either smoke reefer 
 Or either move white, there's few writers in my cypher 
 So they made light of, my type of 
 Dreams seem dumb, they said wise up 
 How many guys-a, you see making it from here 
 The world don't like us, is that not clear? Alright but 
 I'm different, I can't base what I'm gon' be 
 Off of what everybody isn't, they don't listen 
 Just whispering behind my back 
 No vision, lack of ambition, so wack!

 Had a couple of meetings no offers yet 
 Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices 
 Back to the drawing board ducking officers 
 It's all good 'cause the streets is A&R'ing this 
 So with or without any of your involvement 
 We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate 
 I went from pauper to the President 
 'Cause every deal I ever made set precedent 
 Niggas probably thought I'd fall without old buddy (hehehe) 
 Oh buddy, what I do is make more money

 Friend or foe, yo, state your biz 
 Ummm, you tendin' dough? Ah, there it is 
 Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like nobody comin' around here fuckin' with they dough for shit 
 You enterprisin' though, and I like it 
 But fuck with the big dogs, yo, I gotta bite ya 
 Look, it's out of my hands 
 And you gettin' money 'round here, it's not in the plans 
 So hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas 
 I'm sendin' niggas back up in campuses 
 Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is 
 Let me guess, they said it was money 'round here 
 And the rest is me stoppin' you from gettin' it, correct? 
 Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel 
 I'll take care of that, you'll soon see 
 Now please give me the room key 
 You're twitchin', don't do that, you makin' me nervous 
 My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers 
 So please, would you put your hand back in sight? 
 They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right? 
 You draw, better be Picasso—you know, the best 
 'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless 
 You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice 
 Believe you me, son 
 I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done 
 Now calm your boys 
 'Cause I'm findin' it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise 
 Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave 
 I guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys 
 And a promise you never, no matter the weather

 You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all 
 But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all 
 Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small 
 Shit, I watched you mature, nah, this ain't right 
 But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried 
 Over my right shoulder, I told you to wipe your eyes 
 Take your time when you liking a guy 
 'Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, his pimp'll die 
 I bought you earrings on your birthday 
 Drove you to college your first day 
 It must be sad, though it hurts to say 
 We could never be a item, don't even like him 
 You deserve better, this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me 
 There's better guys out there other than me 
 (You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know?) 
 Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D

 If they found that you was hugging me

 I'm young, and I ain't ready, and I told you 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It ain't like, I ain't tell you from day one, I ain't shit 
 When it comes to relationships, I don't have the patience 
 Now it's too late, we got a little life together 
 And in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever 
 But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever 
 A different girl every night forever; told you to leave 
 But your stubborn and you love him and 
 No matter what, despite all the fucking and the cheating 
 You still won't leave him, now you're grieving 
 And I feel bad, believe me 
 But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy 
 Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate 
 You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through 
 Don't wanna fight, don't wanna fuss 
 You the mother of my baby 
 I don't want you to hate me, this is about us 
 Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be 
 And cause I love you, I want you to leave, please

 Daddy left; I, I thought I was makin things better 
 I made it worse

 Dear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell 
 Writing this scribe, thinking 'bout how you must feel inside 
 You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow 
 God damn, I ain't the young man that you used to know 
 You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like 
 Bling-bling ice; I was wrong in hindsight 
 Shit, we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse 
 I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out 
 But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules 
 I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews 
 And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs? 
 Co-workers saw me on the corner slinging Larry Love 
 Meanwhile, you working hard, like 2 or 3 jobs 
 Trying to feed me and my siblings, making an honest living 
 Who am I kidding? I, call myself easing the load 
 I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary 
 Try to understand, please

 Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run 
 Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly 
 So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky

 I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do 
 Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady 
 Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby 
 Never thought I'd say this shit, baby, I'm good 
 You can keep your puss, I don't want no more Bush 
 No more war, no more Iraq 
 No more white lies, the president is black

 Got the whole world like wide open, his mouth 
 Same reason during Katrina that he opened his house 
 Helped raise food, helped raise water so 
 God knows who can feed their son or their daughter 
 Say what I wanna say cause I'ma say, say it 
 Say what I'm gonna say cause I'm a taxpayer 
 Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try 
 You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie 
 And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway 
 And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day 
 I got some white friends and a white Benz 
 Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims 
 'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard 
 Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word 
 My president is black, my Lambo's blue 
 And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too 
 My money's light green and my jewels light gray 
 I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid 
 My president is black, my Lambo's blue 
 And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too 
 My money's light green and my jewels light gray 
 I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid 
 (How much did you pay?) 
 My president is black 
 My Blackberry is too though by the way 
 [Spoken outro][Intro: Beyoncé] 
 Deliver me from my enemies, oh God 
 Defend me from all that rise up against me 
 Deliver me from the work of iniquity 
 And save me from the Bloody Men 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Look.. mind state of a gangster from the 40's 
 Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy 
 Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's 
 Sorry my jewelry's so gaudy 
 Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris 
 America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey 
 Hey young world, wanna hear a story? 
 Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me 
 I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedies 
 Frank Sinatra, having dinner with the Genovese 
 This is the genesis of a nemesis 
 Mother America's not witnessed since 
 The Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses 
 This is the tale of lost innocence 
 As the incense burn and the turntables turn 
 And that Al Green plays 
 I see my mother's afro 
 As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's 
 And my papa just left the house 
 In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray 
 And she's trying to calm her nerves 
 As I observe this is just one day 
 And what tomorrow has in store 
 We can never be sure, so all we can do is... pray 
  
 [Break: Beyoncé] 
 Because of your strength 
 While I walked upon thee 
 For God is my defense (pray for me!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 As I head to my homeroom 
 I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground 
 I hear a car go, "Vroom" 
 Drug dealer in the BM with the top down 
 As the girls start to giggle 
 I ask, "Why you laugh?", they say, "You're too little 
 One day you'll understand when you become a man 
 About things you have to get you" 
 Fast forward, freeze frame on my pistol 
 Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful 
 I didn't choose this life, this life chose me 
 Around here it's the shit that you just do 
 I just left school 
 The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue 
 They had their guns drawn, screaming, "Just move!" 
 "Or is there something else you suggest we can do?" 
 He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, "Huh?" 
 A treasure chest was removed 
 Cops said he'll be back next month 
 What we called corrupt, he calls paying dues 
 Now when the rules is blurred 
 As they is and were, what am I to do? 
 But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me 
 Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through, pray 
  
 [Break: Beyoncé] 
 Deliver me in thy righteousness 
 And cause me to escape 
 And climb thine air unto me 
 Save me thine Lord (pray for me!) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Geah.. anywhere there's oppression 
 And the drug profession 
 Flourishes like beverages, refreshing (ahhh!) 
 Sweet taste of sin 
 Everything I seen made me everything I am 
 Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg 
 What came first? Moving chickens or the egg? 
 This is why I be so fresh 
 I'm trying to beat life 'cause I can't cheat death 
 Treat shame with shamelessness 
 Aim stainlesses at anuses, you know the game this is? 
 Move coke like Pepsi 
 Don't matter what the brand name is 
 I stand behind mine 
 Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine 
 I'm not an angel, I'm sure, but every night before I lay 
 I drop my knees to the floor and I pray 
  
 [Outro: Beyoncé] 
 The name shall endure forever 
 The name shall be continued as long as the sun (pray for me!) 
 Men shall be blessed in Him 
 All nations shall call Him blessed 
 In your name I pray... (pray for me!) 
 Lord bless us[Sample] 
 So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home 
 You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence 
 It's like an exercise 
  
 [Intro] 
 Y'all niggas can't be serious right now 
 I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers 
 I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now: 
 Best flow, most consistent, realest stories 
 Most charisma, I set the most trends 
 And my interviews are hotter! Holla! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring 
 That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain 
 I spring train in the winter, 'round early December 
 Run suicide drills over and over 
 With the weight of the world on my shoulder 
 That's why they call me "Hova" 
 I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard 
 I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep 
 I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends 
 I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death 
 And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and 
 I run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up) 
 Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!) 
 I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets 
 Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch 
 I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers 
 The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is 
 Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya 
 Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs 
 The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot 
 Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep 
 No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet 
 Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One, two, three, four, breathe easy 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up 
 Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up 
 Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy 
 Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids 
 I lift every voice when I sing, my ability 
 Make yours look like an exercise in futility 
 Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads 
 We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles 
 Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel 
 Same routine when you see me you know the drill 
 I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch 
 Off your arm, remain nice and calm 
 Put down your things, Trinidad of the game 
 Know my way around your ring 
 No matter how many pounds you bring 
 It sounds like the same old thing 
 R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers 
  
 [Chorus] 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One (and, and, and) one 
 Two (and, and, and) two 
 Three (and, and, and) three 
 (and) four, breathe easy... 
 One, two, three, four, breathe easy[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh uh-huh, gi-gi gi-geyeah 
 Roc-A-Fella y'all, uh-huh uh-huh, Jigga 
 Timbaland shit, nine-eight, BEATCH 
 Say what, say what? Uh-huh uh-huh, follow me beatch 
  
 [Refrain: Amil (Jay-Z)] 
 Nigga what, nigga who? 
 (Y'all niggas can't fuck with me) 
 Nigga what, (get ready yo) nigga who? 
 Switcha flow, getcha dough 
 Can't fuck with this Roc-A-Fella shit though 
 Switcha flow, getcha dough 
 Can't fuck with this Roc-A-Fella shit though 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh uh-huh, yeah, yeah 
 Motherfuckers wanna act loco 
 Hit 'em up numerous 
 Shots with the fo'-fo' 
 Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco 
 Fuck rap, coke by the boatload 
 Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
 Left holes through some guy clothes 
 Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip 
 Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
 One shot could make a nigga do a full flip 
 See the nigga laying shocked when the bullet hit 
 Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you 
 But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele 
 Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly 
 If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly 
 All night get you wide up inside the telly 
 Side to side, 'til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)] 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfuckin' Z 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it 
 The same place where the rhymes is invented 
 So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke 
 See how I was flowing on my last cassette 
 Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a TEC, never jam though 
 Never get hot, never run out of ammo 
 Niggas hating and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch 
 You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
 And now you're, acting raw but you never had war 
 Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho 
 Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty 
 Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy 
 She want, us to end 'cause I fucked her friend 
 She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
 I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "shit 
 There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!" 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)] 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me 
 (Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfucking Z 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Got a vendetta even though I been better 
 Left him in the cold with a thin sweater 
 Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack, niggas threw 
 Two at me I threw fo' back, hold that 
 Let the dough stack 
 Way before Biggs had the gold Ac' 
 Dame had the Lex black 
 Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that 
 And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at 
 I suggest that niggas invest in a vest when I come through 
 With the Glock jet black you niggas step back 
 I'm the best at you know I ain't no apprentice to this 
 Me and my niggas we invented the shit 
 I came into the business with this, The Originator, none greater 
 Jaz-O finish this shit 
  
 [Verse 4: Big Jaz (Jay-Z)] 
 Better learn, Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me? 
 Worldwide Originator say word to me 
 The population holla certainly 
 I burn a nigga like a third degree 
 See me shine so bright 
 Nigga I'm my light, running ruling with rigor and vigor 
 Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga 
 You fly-by-nights stop chirping B 
 Heavyweight's light work for me 
 For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurting me 
 What, cut your face in like surgery 
 Who the fuck got a VS 
 Fucking BM's on the road 
 When you had to be in bed at the PM 
 Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N 
 Forever touching my work is beginning you’re ending 
 Nigga your style's no style my style's hostile 
 C'mon, faggot nigga down to take the gun home 
 The O-RI-GI-NA-TOR 
 (Can't FUCK with it, can ya?!) 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)] 
 (Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me

 Yeah... 
 Come experience... life as we know it 
 As some of you should know it 
 Place: Marcy, Brooklyn 
 Actions: well, y'all know the actions 
  
 [Verse 1:  Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks 
 He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock 
 He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking 
 To honies hawking I'm the hottest nigga in New York and 
 I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils 
 He want to run with me, I know this kid will be loyal 
 I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear 
 Then it's just enough for re-up again 
 I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's 
 To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace 
 That's just the natural cycle, nobody want to be like Michael 
 Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun 
 We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green 
 I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen 
 Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone 
 That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Memphis Bleek)] 
 It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground) 
 It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two) 
  
 [Verse 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up 
 In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name 
 I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace 
 Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats 
 He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls 
 Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all 
 I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me 
 If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see 
 I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day 
 And chasing crack heads up the block for my pay 
 I'm staying fresh, so chickens check 
 I'm trying to step up to the next level 
 Pushing Vettes through the 'jects, diamonds reflect from the sun 
 Directly in your equilibrium, and stunned 
 I'm waiting for my day to come, I got the urge to splurge 
 I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Memphis Bleek)] 
 It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground) 
 It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek] 
 Hey fella I been watching you clocking 
 Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing 
 You the man nigga, now stop fronting 
 Hahah I like your style (Nah, I like your style) 
 Let's drive around awhile (Cool nigga) 
 Here's a thou' (A G? I ride with you for free) 
 I want the long-term riches and bitches 
 Have it all, now listen to me 
 You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame 
 Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same 
 (On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow 
 You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!) 
 Hey keep your cool 
 The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand 
 Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand 
 Don't blow your dough on hotties 
 The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts 
 And won't break them for nobody 
 Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start 
 From now until death do us part, nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (Memphis Bleek)] 
 It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground) 
 It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two) 
 It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground) 
 It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot) 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)[Intro] 
 Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah 
 What it is player? 
 (You player, it's all about you 
 How you gon' say that man) 
 If I had your hand I'd turn mine in 
 (Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off) 
 Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money 
 You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money 
 (Check this out man, you run up on your bitches 
 This is what you tell 'em 
 Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot 
 Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry 
 Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing 
 Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen 
 Spitting venom up in the minds of young women 
 Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar 
 Might you remember, my shit is cold like December 
 Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere 
 Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs 
 18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets 
 Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth 
 I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned 
 'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon 
 The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I 
 Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro 
 As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough 
 Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe 
 I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol 
 Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal 
 The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb 
 Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric 
 I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole 
 I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know 
 From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary 
 From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now 
 Notice the child swift like a Lotus 
 Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it 
 Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye 
 Yet I still feel the need to be fly 
 I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin 
 You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet 
 I never cry if I did I'd cry ice 
 From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice 
 Life's short, so play hard and stick hard 
 And the only time you love them is when your dick hard 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby) 
 Nah, you know, that's just laid back man 
 (Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z) 
 Cashmere baby 
 (Motherfucking pimp that's what he be) 
 Cashmere baby 
 (It don't get no hotter than that baby) 
 Sho' yo right, sho' yo right 
 (Them niggas know) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Check it out, check it out 
 Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin 
 Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and 
 I gotta keep your tricks intact 
 'Cause I walk like a p-iyimp, talk like a mack, man 
 The star player, the golden bar layer 
 The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sho' yo right 
 I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight? 
 Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right 
 I pimp hard on a trick: look 
 Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot...[Intro: Sample (JAY-Z)] 
 I'm not a one girl's guy... (real talk for ya, peep game) 
 Ain't they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie 
 (we don't lie man) 
 And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that) 
 Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open (I may never say never) 
 But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from (too many ladies, ha) 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: JAY-Z] 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 Woo! Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'? 
 Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin'? 
 Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question 
 I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression 
 To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge 
 She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college 
 Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutorin' 
 In and out I'm movin' through her student body union 
 And she, call me "Professor," say daddy come and test her 
 So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester 
 I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate 
 She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)] 
 I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
 Now let the people sing 
 (I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out) 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 Huh, who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'? 
 Who said what, why you trippin' girl, why's you fussin'? 
 Got this model slash actress slash part time waitress 
 Spend her whole day, she hanging round with part time haters 
 All they do is dish dirt and put a up on my latest 
 Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see 
 I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys 
 Tend to hurries in ten places at once 
 Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines 
 Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh 
 Our time apart is our time apart 
 So love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart 
 And some day I slow down, but for now I get around 
 Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty inches 
 Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace 
 You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)] 
 (I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out) 
 Put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I get off tour 
 I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle 
 Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie 
 Chanel under the Louis, Gucci over her booty 
 Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city 
 Pretty, witty, girly, worldly 
 One who likes to party but come home early 
 Light kinda dark, short sorta tall 
 Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all 
 She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license 
 But she can get you first class seats for coach prices 
 Isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight 
 Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds 
  
 [Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)] 
 (I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out) 
 Put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I get off tour 
 I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Outro: The Persuaders sample] 
 I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it 
 When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it 
 Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over 
 But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from 
 I'm tryin' girls out, waitin' patiently 
 Just tryin' girls out, until I find the one for me[Produced by Ski Beatz] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Uh-huh uh huh uh 
 Gee-gee-geyeah 
 Peeping, watching, streets 
 You boys are soft like bread 
 Uh-huh uh huh uh 
 Live from Brooklyn 
 Uh-huh uh 
 The streets is watching 
 Check it, check 
 Uh-huh uh, check 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless 
 But if you shoot me, then you're famous 
 What's a nigga to do? 
 When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking 
 Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake 
 Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted 
 But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it 
 Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates 
 Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it 
 Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass 
 This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time 
 Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas 
 Trying to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneilly 
 The type to start a beef then run to the cops 
 When I see you in the street got one in the drop 
 When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop 
 Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop 
 The streets is watching 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the, streets is watching 
 Blocks keep clocking 
 Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake 
 Can't ignore it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now it's hard not to kill niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill 
 The streets is watching you 
 When you froze your arms 
 Niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm 
 Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up 
 Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter 
 Once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader 
 Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer 
 Kidnap niggas wanna steal you 
 Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya 
 For the name, niggas don't know the rules 
 Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool 
 Force your hand, of course that man's plotting 
 Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the, streets is watching 
 Blocks keep clocking 
 Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake 
 Can't ignore it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 My street mentality: flip bricks forever 
 Know me and money, we like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together 
 Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground 
 Hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around 
 Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found 
 Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now 
 Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks 
 Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets 
 See out of space like Mercury, you jerking me? Hectic 
 Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message 
 It said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here 
 I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare' 
 Ay there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture 
 Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer 
 Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants 
 The other half in the casket lay dormant 
 I felt like life was cheating me 
 For the first time in my life I was getting money 
 But it was like my conscience was eating me 
 Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that 
 I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back? 
 Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad? 
 Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack? 
 Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack 
 And not collide like two trains that's on the same track 
 But, get my life together like the oils I bring back 
 In the bottom of the pot where the, water gets hot 
 Got my transporter take it across the border then stop 
 To set up shop with a quarter of rock 
 Here's the plan: for three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block 
 But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes 
 One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops 
 And this unstable way of living just, had to stop 
 Half of my niggas got time, we done real things 
 By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes 
 Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit 
 But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit 
 The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime 
 And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind 
 I figured, "shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes 
 And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?" 
 The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate 
 So high in one city they send National Guards to get me 
 Ya dig? The streets[Intro] 
 (Roc-A-Fella, y'all)

 [Verse 1] 
 Come on the track like duh duh duh-duh 
 With a throwback jersey and a fitted 
 Might blow a bag of Hershey in the sidd-ix 
 Or might take sips of army with a chidd-ick, I'm so sick with it 
 Lampin' in the Hamptons 
 The weekends man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus 
 Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes 
 The Izod bucket on, I'm so old school 
 Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops 
 Six top model chicks – who is this hot? 
 J-A, ladies help me say it now 
 Y-Z, mami why you playin' with me? 
 Ride with me, get high as me 
 It's how it's supposed to be, when you rollin' with G's 
 Hov! Back up in this bitch like whoa 
 Jigga get this whole shit jumpin' like six-fo's 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Hov) V is I, and I am him 
 (Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!) 
 Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims 
 (Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!) 
 And if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all

 And if y'all go to war for me I go to war with y'all

 [Verse 2] 
 Hov! And so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu 
 She's respondin', top is C. Ronson 
 We in Luan (woo!) gettin' our groove on 
 Buyin' out the bar, on our way to Spa' 
 She never seen a hundred on the wrist before 
 Never seen twenty-two's on the 6 before 
 I am, killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid 
 'Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade 
 The crib got killer views and square feet 
 You have to film MTV Cribs for a week 
 So, sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you 
 Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good) 
 I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants 
 Weight is low enough to let your waist show 
 Top like a rock star, I got a fast car 
 We can cruise the city, doin' a buck-sixty 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Hov) V is I, and I am him 
 (Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!) 
 Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims

 And if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all

 And if y'all go to war for me I go to war with y'all

 [Verse 3] 
 "He did it again!" – haters no like 
 But they gotta fuck with it 'cause the flow's so tight 
 Gnarly dude! I puff Bob Marley, dude 
 All day like Rastafaris do 
 Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move 
 You fuckin' up my high, don't bother me, dude 
 But Red Rover, send your hoes over 
 She can do WHATEVER, sip somethin' with soda 
 She can leave WHENEVER, sip somethin' with Hova 
 We can play HOWEVER, slay bed or sofa 
 And the prognosis, sex is explosive 
 Left her with wet bedsheets, nigga, I'm focused 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Hov) V is I, and I am him 
 (Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!) 
 Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims 
 (Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!) 
 And if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all

 And if y'all go to war for me I go to war with y'all

 [Chorus: Lil Wayne] 
 Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'? 
 Where you goin'? And can I come too? 
 And If I can, I'm a be your man 
 You could be my lady, and have my baby 
 And drive my cars, and drive me crazy 
 Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me 
 'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken 
 I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin' 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Like a mama you birth me, Brooklyn you nursed me 
 Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley 
 They said you'd murk me, by the time I was 21 
 That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me 
 Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter 
 Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn Carter 
 When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend ya 
 'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner 
 And I'm eatin', so much I bought extra 
 So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast 
 I only roll Lexus, to hug your road 
 I love your corners, I'm half your soul 
  
 [Chorus: Lil Wayne] 
 Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'? 
 Where you goin'? Can I come too? 
 And If I can, I'm a be your man 
 You could be my lady, and have my baby 
 And drive my cars, and drive me crazy 
 Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me 
 'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken 
 I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin' 
  
 [Verse 2: Lil Wayne (Jay-Z)] 
 Hello Brooklyn, what's your story? 
 She said she eatin' on the run but she ain't N.O.R.E 
 She said she got a man but he ain't worried 
 But baby I'ma have to rob him like Horry 
 She said she love B.I.G. and she like 2Pac 
 And when I said Jay-Z she say "It's The Roc!" 
 And I'ma leave it like this, like this like that 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Have you seen her? 
 And when she tell you somethin' you better believe her 
 She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor 
 And so I said goodbye Katrina, and hello Brooklyn 
 But baby you are, the sweetest sight eyes could see 
 I said hello Brooklyn 
 But baby I hope you never say goodbye to me 
 I said hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are so damn fine to me 
 And I remember the time (time), place (place) and the weather 
 On the day you said hi to me and let's say hello Brooklyn 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Brooklyn you crazy, look how you made me 
 Razor blades in my mouth walkin' 'round behavin' 
 All demented black hoodies and Timberlanded 
 Always schemin', "you see the gleam on that niggas pendant?" 
 Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence, look what you had me doin' 
 But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude 
 It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill 
 Baby I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville 
 But my Bed's in the Stuy though I'll lie flat in your bush 
 'Til we smoke a C.I., what up to the boy B.I 
 You know I handle B.I., I don't half-step on the 'caine 
 Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan so? 
 She like it hardcore, so I grind slow 
 Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0 
 My fine ho, we got some victims to catch 
 So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some Nets 
  
 [Chorus: Lil Wayne] 
 Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'? 
 Where you goin'? And can I come too? 
 And If I can, I'm a be your man 
 You could be my lady, and have my baby 
 And drive my cars, and drive me crazy 
 Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me 
 'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken 
 I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin' 
  
 [Outro: Lil Wayne] 
 And hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are 
 The sweetest thing eyes could see 
 Hello Brooklyn, baby I hope 
 You never say goodbye to me 
 I said hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are 
 So damn fine to me 
 But I remember the time, place, and the weather 
 On the day she said goodbye to me 
 So I say hello Brooklyn[Intro: Little Beaver sample]

 Say hello, to the bad guy (hello) they say I'm a bad guy 
 I come from the bottom, but now I'm mad fly (say hello) 
 They say I'm a menace (hello) that's the picture they paint 
 They say a lot about me, let me tell you what I ain't (say hello) 
 They say I'm a bad guy (hello) say hi to the bad guy 
 I come from the bottom, but now I'm mad fly (say hello)

 [Verse 1] 
 I ain't playing, life's short so I aim 
 I ain't waiting for life start betraying 'em 
 It's twice as hard to get a job that's paying 'em 
 So I ain't paying attention to what you're saying 
 Raindrops keep falling on my brain 
 'Cause I'm in the drop on flames 
 I'm so hot even if the weather change 
 I don't have no top, I'm insane 
 'Member dark-skinned Jermaine 
 Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same 
 'Cept I'm no lame and you gonna know my name 
 Before I go the world gon' feel my pain 
 They saying I'm a bad guy, why's that? 
 'Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga I react 
 Secretly though, I know you admire that 
 You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrrap! 
 Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh 
 You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrap!

 I ain't no ordinary nigga 
 Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya (IT AIN'T!) 
 Extraordinary figures (damn) 
 I'm an extraordinary nigga 
 Before my name became Jigga 
 Before I sang I had that thang on slippers 
 Can't complain 'bout what they ain't gon' give ya 
 That ain't gon' get ya shit, might as well give up 
 Or get up, get out and get something nigga 
 Get a job my nigga, or get to dumping 
 Only God can judge him, only he without sin 
 Tell me if my means, justify my ends 
 'Til then, I'm just gon' fly in the Benz 
 Wire my friends through Western Union

 My system knocking, here comes the bad guy again 
 Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh 
 Hello, uhh here comes the bad guy again

 [Verse 3] 
 ... let me tell you what I ain't 
 We ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs 
 Nobody do that where we grew at, nigga duh 
 The poverty line we not above 
 So out comes the mask and gloves 'cause we ain't feeling the love 
 We ain't doin crime for the sake of doing crimes 
 We movin dimes 'cause we ain't doing fine 
 One out of three of us is locked up doing time 
 You know what this type of shit can do to a nigga mind 
 My mind on my money, money on my mind 
 If you owe me ten dollars you ain't giving me nine 
 Y'all ain't give me forty acres and a mule 
 So I got my Glock 40 now I'm cool 
 And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me 
 Somebody give him the word and tell him I don't approve 
 Tell him I remove the curses 
 If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect 
 When Jena Six don't exist 
 Tell him that's when I'll stop saying bitch, BEEEITCH! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Say hello, to the bad guy (hello) they say I'm a bad guy 
 I come from the bottom, but now I'm mad fly (say hello)

 They say a lot about me, let me tell you what I ain't (say hello) 
 They say I'm a bad guy (hello) say hi to the bad guy

 You know, you've got this fantasy in yo' head about 
 Gettin' outta the life and settin the corporate world on its ear 
 What the fuck you gonna do except hustle? 
 Besides pimpin', you really ain't got the stomach for that 
  
 [Verse: Jay-Z] 
 The game's fucked up 
 Nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it 
 Your lyrics didn't—your gangsta look did it 
 So I would write it if y'all could get it 
 Bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic 
 On the internet, they like "You should spit it" 
 I'm like "You should buy it, nigga that's good business" 
 Forget this rap shit, I need a new hustle 
 A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell 
 I say that reluctantly 'cause I do struggle 
 As you see I can't leave so I do love you 
 But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper 
 In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper 
 Back when crack was 
 What these pills are, I was a real star 
 Complete with real cars, no video ones 
 You can come and set up a camera, let the video run 
 And my real life, complete with real ice 
 VVS boulders all invisibly set 
 Head and shoulders, my invisible neck 
 You see Hova wasn't digital yet 
 Befo' Steve Jobs made the iPod 
 Was getting head jobs, we call that interneck 
 Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette 
 With a automatic weapon I was rappin' with a TEC 
 Fresh like Mannie be, chain like anti-freeze 
 Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me keys 
 Pantries full of Arm & Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see 
 What it do, I'm a damn G 
 Just sent a million dollars through a hands free 
 That's big money talk, can you answer me? 
 Before the answer was a 3 
 I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick 
 Sure he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit 
 That's why they call him Hov, 'cause he came before all this shit 
 Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights 
 Bought a 9 for non-stop Glock work all the time 
 Woo! Guess who's back? 
 Since this is a New Era, got a fresh new hat 
 Ten year veteran, I've been set 
 I've been through with this bullshit game but I never can 
 I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill 
 But last year alone I grossed 38 mill' 
 I know I ain't quite 38 but still 
 The flow so Special got a .38 feel 
 The real is back, hehehehe[Intro]

 Emory, whattup? 
 Told you I ain't too good with writing letters and all 
 Shit, I don't even write rhymes 
 But what I will do 
 I'mma send you this open scribe through the airwaves 
 Vibe with me... 
 Yeah, nigga, I bet we was kids and had dreams of being here 
 I said "we" 'cause I'm here, you here! 
 Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved, family 
 Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go 
 We in South Beach and the Hamptons, too, baby!

 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 Do you wanna ride with me?

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You know why they call the projects a project 
 Because it's a project! 
 An experiment, we're in it, only as objects 
 And the object for us to explore our prospects 
 And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes! 
 As kids we would daydream, sitting on our steps 
 Pointing at cars like yeah that's our sex 
 Hustlers profits made our eyes stretch 
 So on some Dr. Spock shit, we started our trek 
 Some of us made it, most of us digressed 
 In the name of those who ain't made it, my progress 
 We show success, please live through me 
 See, I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive 
 (This is a collect call) So every time I press 5 
 All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly 
 Up in the fed, and still holdin' his head 
 So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread 
 Now let's ride 
  
 [Chorus: John Legend] 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go

 I'm crushing all award shows 
 MTV, BET, the Grammys, crushed linen, Purple Label 
 All that fly shit we talked about 
 Giving them Sinatra pinky rings with the blue diamonds and everything 
 Hehehe, that's what we talked about right? 
 Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 International Hov, I told you so 
 40/40s out in Tokyo 
 Singapore, all this from singing songs 
 Coming up though we thought slinging raw 
 Was the end-all-be-all of being rich, didn't we? 
 Little did I know my mo' potent delivery 
 Would deliver me, kingpin of the ink pen 
 Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor 
 Heh, the Cola, yeah 
 Hova still getting it in with soda 
 Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight 
 Started from the crates now I'm sitting on a whole case 
 Since they got you sitting on that old case 
 Our dreams is on hold like TiVo 
 So I can't wait till you get your date 
 I got some temp plates outside of the gate 
 We gon' ride 
  
 [Chorus: John Legend] 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 Do you wanna ride with me? 
 Do you wanna ride with me? 
  
 [Jay-Z: over Chorus] 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Geah 
 Don't even worry about it though, you ain't missed nuttin 
 It only gets better, they got the Maybach Coupe now 
 Look like the Batmobile, the Phantom the top just comes off that joint 
 It only gets better 
 They caught your body they can't trap your mind 
 Keep your spirit alive read your books 
 Matter of fact, let me take you somewhere 
 Vibe with me, c'mon 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Now me and my lil' mama, Quita and Ty-Ty 
 Juan and Dez out in Saint-Tropez 
 Jay Brown and Kawanna, sneaking marijuana 
 You know that Mary J., give you no more drama 
 Lost a couple friends this whole shit got weird 
 But when you get home you know your spot's reserved, ya heard? 
 I put my niggas on, my niggas put they niggas on 
 Now we all somewhere foreign, chillin', sippin' somethin' 
 I ain't forget you cousin, heh 
 Yeah nigga y'all can wear sneakers on the beach if you want to 
 Y'all niggas come and c'mon, playin' money marathon 
 My young'n is LeBron, you know what that makes me, baby 
 Big Homie! Hehe, Emory, what's up? 
  
 [Chorus: John Legend] 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 I know, I know 
 Some places we can go, some places we can go 
 Do you wanna ride with me? 
 Do you wanna ride with me? 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z]

 Guru, I don't usually do this but 
 Roll me up something man 
 Let me get mellow on this shit right here 
 Uh-huh, yeah 
 Uh-huh, white paper though nigga 
 Can't even fuck with those blunts 
 White paper baby, old school nigga gimme a joint 
 Smooth it out, Young H.O. 
 Emory Jones 
 Word to my momma, we livin'![Intro] 
 Woo! 
 Uhh, uhh 
 It's The Gift and the Curse 
 Uhh, uhh, yeah 
 First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again 
 They love me again 
 Let's take a trip down 
 I gotcha 
  
 [Verse] 
 Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery 
 Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every 
 Young black life is this line, "Damn, him already? 
 Such a good kid," got us pourin' Henn' already 
 Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above 
 When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love 
 So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi 
 Till the next time I see her, on the other side 
 He was just some thug that caught some slugs 
 And we loved him 'cause, in him we saw some of us 
 He walked like us, talked like us 
 His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn 
 Poor Isis, that's his mama name 
 Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name? 
 Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him 
 Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband 
 Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him 
 Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him 
 Damn near impossible, only men can raise men 
 He was his own man, not even him can save him 
 He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist 
 But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate 
 End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm 
 That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world 
 Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away 
 Isis' life just ended on that rainy day 
 When she got the news her boy body could be viewed 
 Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude 
 Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew 
 Angel dust, dipped in WOO! 
 She slipped into her own fantasy world 
 Had herself pregnant by a different dude 
 But reality bites and this is her life 
 He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife 
 It was just this night when moon was full 
 And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight 
 Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home 
 Will you still love me after this night? 
 Mike was the hard head from around the way 
 That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype 
 Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike 
 He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like 
 It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right 
 He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life 
 But Isis liked this Broadway life 
 She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites 
 Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight 
 She was so turned on that she had to shower twice 
 How ironic it would be some fight that 
 Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life 
 See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene 
 Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice 
 Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like 
 "If that was my son, he would look much different 
 See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark" 
 So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe 
 Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?) 
 Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach 
 It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak 
 He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day 
 He approached this thug that had a mean mug 
 And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz" 
 Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you) 
 Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub 
 He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up) 
 There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before 
 It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature 
 And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord 
 You know what they say about he who hesitates in war 
 (What's that?) He who hesitates is lost 
 He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank 
 The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct 
 Six shots into his kin, out of the gun 
 Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son 
 Six shots into his kin out of the gun 
 Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons 
  
 [Outro] 
 Meet the parents...[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in? 
 There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, knahmean? 
 How can a muh'fucka go round and hate a nigga 
 He never even met that, he don't even know and shit? 
 I think this rap shit is all beef 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress 
 Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest 
 Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless 
 I'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest 
 You think I'm freaking these chicks, right? 
 I try not to brush against they chest 
 You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped 
 Swear to everything when I leave this earth 
 It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt 
 You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine 
 We'll lose two lives, yours and mines 
 Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve 
 At the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve 
 Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me 
 And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged 
 Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God 
 And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me 
  
 [Chorus: Karen Anderson] 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I hate all girls with ulterior motives 
 That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons, no daughters 
 Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters 
 Hear the hate in my voice, right? I hate that you noticed 
 Niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own 
 Hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own 
 Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome 
 Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon 
 You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop 
 And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock 
 I'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact 
 But ain't no turning back, bring it on 
 Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much 
 Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much? 
 Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us 
 Steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me 
  
 [Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)] 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 You only know what you see 
 (Since I was 4 years old 
 I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold) 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 (And now that I've arrived 
 I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 And niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly 
 But I know any type of success breeds envy 
 I know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me 
 Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny 
 But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive 
 Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up 
 And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up 
 Don't grieve for me, my art remains 
 Like a dart from the speaker to your heart 
 Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal 
 Don't plan to leave without a fight, I plant a seed I give life 
 Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife 
 Next time you're thinking heist better be precise 
 'Cause I'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here 
 I have no regrets even though I won't see grow 
 My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo, lucky me 
  
 [Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)] 
 You only know what you see 
 (I been told, since I was 4 years old 
 Everything that glitters ain't gold 
 And now that I've arrived) 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 (I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold 
 Since I was 4 years old) 
 You only know what you see 
 (I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold 
 And now that I've arrived) 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 (I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold) 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me 
 You only know what you see 
 You don't understand what it takes to be me[Intro] 
 Yes, yes YEP! 
 Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza 
 I'd like to introduce my band right now 
 Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe 
 Right now I want you to give the drummer some 
 No ma really, give the drummer some 
 Uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable 
 Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable 
 Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Follow the flow, look 
 They say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much 
 Further than the giant.. (the giant..) 
 So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see 
 Further than I am... (than I am..) 
 And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation 
 With David and Goliath.. (Goliath..) 
 But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course 
 And I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..) 
 But me and Tyran, comin' through your environment 
 Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back 
 With "The Team," no I in that 
 R.O.C., y'all not eyein' that 
 Y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone 
 "The Dynasty," no not Ming but Shawn's 
 Dame, Kareem, nigga it's the gangsta team 
 Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene 
 The other reason, we got a gang of green 
 If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga 
 (WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!) Jeah, jeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable 
 Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable 
 Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Jeah, look 
 I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life 
 Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice 
 Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present 
 I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past 
 How they propose to deal with my perfect present? 
 When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session 
 Ain't no livin' person can test him 
 Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him 
 Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it 
 But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it 
 If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it 
 Got mad at it and don't want it no more 
 And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw 
 Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted 
 Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice 
 Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable 
 Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable 
 Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone 
 The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back 
 You cats over-felt yourself 
 You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real 
 In my absence cats get, absent-minded 
 Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em 
 Why I'm in the position that I am 
 Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna 
 Well after I'm gone, they'll honor 
 History in the makin', Pistol Pete 
 Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!) 
 Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track 
 The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM! 
 And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget 
 The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath 
 Can't see me skill for skill or check for check 
 It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck 
 Live and direct, I will bring it to your set 
 I got now, I don't care who got next 
 Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart 
 Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless 
 You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'? 
 You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards) 
 I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit 
 Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident 
 Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable 
 Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable 
 Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)[Intro] 
 D-P, D-P, D-P 3 
 3, 3, 3, D-P 3 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 While others spit that Wonderama shit 
 Me and my conglomerate 
 Same crime, bigger trial, Your Honor suck a dick 
 Let me, live out my dreams until my heart give out 
 Involved with cream, you know exactly what this is about 
 Fuck y'all mean, handlin' since a teen 
 Like LeBron or Sebastian, high school graduates 
 Straight to the league, I ain't waitin' for my knee to blow 
 Yesterday I was needin' this dough 
 Get it? I was kneadin' this dough 
 Long as your math is fast, if your readin' is slow 
 Yo, my life ain't rosy but I roll with it 
 My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it 
 Then told me that the Mo' did it 
 And now it's Kosher, shit is so Hasidic 
 I blow a digit on the diamond at San Tropé visits 
 And won't miss it, so don't twist it 
 Young is just as nice and more risks than '96, KID 
  
 [Chorus] 
 D-P 3, YES! 
 Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go 
 Jacksons go back then we cop us some mo' 
 The Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know 
 D-P 3, D-P 3 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 My boy Sig said 
 He was on a tier where no tears can fall 
 'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off 
 See in my inner circle, all we do is ball 
 'Til we all got triangles on our wall 
 Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record 
 I recall, 'cause I've really been there before 
 Never far behind, 'cause I think too forward 
 All about the grind like me so horny 
 Warned you early on about my mindset 
 You thought it was an empty bomb threat 
 'Til I flew into the building like 100 Osamas 
 Said to do a few millions 
 Expose the world to a hustler's true feelings 
 I came into this game with nothing to prove 
 You'll never stop a nigga in that type of mood 
 So every move I make confuse the industry 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me 
 D-P 3 
  
 [Chorus] 
 D-P 3 
 Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go 
 Jacksons go back then we cop us some mo' 
 The Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor 
 I'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know 
 D-P 3[Chorus: N.W.A. sample] 
 Let's describe a certain female 
 Let's describe a certain female 
 Let's describe a certain female 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 (Bitch) you know my name and the company I own 
 (Bitch) you like my style and you smell my cologne 
 (Bitch) don't try to act like my track-record ain't known 
 (Bitch) you probably gotta couple CD's in your home 
 (Bitch) don't make me say it twice, you acting all up tight 
 All sidity like, like, like you ain't a (Bitch) 
 I ain't no ball player, you ain't gonna get pregnant and get 
 Hit off with paper, you gonna get hit off and slid off 
 Before the neighbors take off to go to work 
 So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit 
 (Bitch) I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do 
 Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to 
 They be hipping dudes, how you chickens move, I be listening too 
 (Bitch, bitch, bitch) 
 Don't make me say it thrice, you acting all up tight 
 All sidity like, like you ain't a (Bitch) 
 You ain't no better cause you don't be fucking rappers 
 You only fuck with actors, you still getting fucked backwards 
 (Bitch) Unless you fucked a dude on his own merit 
 And not the way he dribbles or ball or draw lyrics 
 You're a (Bitch), No ma, you're a (Bitch) 
  
 [Chorus: N.W.A. sample] 
 Let's describe a certain female 
 Let's describe a certain female

 [Interlude] 
 Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for, huh? 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 (Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve 
 Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves 
 Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up 
 Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up 
 Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids 
 Bitches in street with their nose in your biz 
 Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies 
 Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride 
 Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass 
 Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast 
 Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live 
 Bitches have niggas all up in your crib 
 Sisters tell you quick "you better check your homie" 
 Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie 
 Sisters love Jay 'cause they know how Hov' is 
 I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch[Intro: Jeezy] 
 Yeah, see it's that 
 It's that Blueprint 3 shit right here 
 It's that TM 103 shit right here 
 You ready? You ready Hov'? 
 Let's go! (Hands up!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jeezy] 
 Allow me to re-introduce myself 
 At the same time re-introduce my wealth 
 At the same time rejuvenate the game 
 It's for my old dog niggas that's used to 'caine 
 Now what B-dog said, I respect the game 
 GD's, Vice Lords, the Crips the same 
 And I know you're 'bout to say this off the chain 
 Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane 
 See I ain’t dead or in jail, I can’t complain 
 And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain 
 And if you just tunin' in, let me explain 
 You know I keep that 47, Uday Hussein 
 These niggas way too far, I played the game 
 And if you listen hard enough I say some things 
 And when that sack got low, I shave them things 
 And put 'em right back together, I made them things 
  
 [Chorus: Jeezy] 
 Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique 
 Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby 
 Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch 
 Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Wassup, wassup 
 Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 I got it Jeezy... 
 Now where that Southside at, wassup, wassup 
 Where the West Coast at, put your W's up 
 Where my East Coast niggas that hustle to live 
 And all my niggas up north that's doin' a bid 
 Oh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare 
 I rap and I’m real, I'm one of the few here 
 These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care 
 They stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear 
 But don't really matter as long as they stay clear 
 Clear of the real shit we doin' over here 
 When my nigga get home, I'm gon' send him a Lear 
 For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air 
 With a couple of broads get him right up in the air 
 Mile high club get him right up in there 
 Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year 
 By the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here 
 Real nigga shit, there 
  
 [Chorus: Jeezy] 
 Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique 
 Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby 
 Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch 
 Say you lookin' for the real, hey well this is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 A hundred million to the good and I'm still talkin' yayo 
 At a snails pace I won this race that y’all trail 
 Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale 
 Followin' my footprints you can't fail 
 Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail 
 I'll probably never see jail 
 Each tale contains more of the truth 
 Of the statute allows me to go into detail 
 Uh, close your eyes, you can smell 
 Hov's the audio equivalent of braille 
 That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil 
 And Waterhouse 'cause real recognize real 
 Rrraaahhh! 
  
 [Verse 4: Jeezy] 
 You know me, I don't need no introduction 
 Call me make a lil' somethin' out of nothin' 
 Anywhere you go, we're the topic of discussion 
 Damn, that's gotta be disgusting 
 Err, shit make me wanna throw up 
 It's big boy music, it should make me wanna grow up 
 Flows like syrup, it just make me wanna pour up 
 And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up 
 A big fat one (one), then unpack one (one) 
 Then unwrap one, peel back one (one) 
 They use to call me Jizzle with the stamp in the middle 
 And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle 
 Whassup! 
  
 [Chorus: Jeezy] 
 Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique 
 Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby 
 Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch 
 Say you lookin' for the real, hey well this is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! 
 Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! This is real as it gets[Produced by Just Blaze] 
  
 [Intro] 
 This is a state of emergency 
 What you want me to do? I'm sorry! 
 I'm back 
 Hey, hey, hey 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Show me what you got, lil mama 
 Show me what you got, pretty lady 
 Show me what you got, shorty 
 Show me what you got, baby 
 Hands up and waves, waves, waves, waves 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Give the drummer some 
 I already gave the summer some 
 It's the winter's turn, Hovi Hov is the coldest 
 I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One 
 Young, no two alike like a snowflake 
 Okay, show me what you got babe 
 Words is slurring, engine purring 
 Mami front, but I'm so determined 
 Shots of Patron, now she in the zone 
 I ain't talking bout the 2-3 
 Mami in the zone like the homie two-three 
 Jordan or James, makes no difference 
 We all ballin' the same 
 Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin' 
 Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin' 
 What you write is not important 
 So it forced him to go for the hype 
 For being brave they may applaud him 
 But misery, I will assure them 
 Aww baby, just ignore them 
 Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn 
 I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Show me what you got, lil mama 
 Show me what you got, pretty lady 
 Show me what you got, shorty 
 Show me what you got, baby 
 Hands up and waves, waves, waves, waves 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that Ace of Spade 
 Why even fool with these other guys, they all stingy 
 All these dudes know how to say is gimme 
 Gimme some head, gimme some brain 
 Gimme your number, gimme your name 
 But if I get one night baby girl, I swear 
 I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here 
 I'll take you shopping, take long trips 
 I'll take the cork off, you can take sips 
 I'll take you there, take my time 
 Take your clothes off, you take off mine 
 Ma, show me what you got 
 Hovi in the spot, tried to told you I was hot 
 Tell these other dudes it's a wrap 
 Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back! 
 Y'all got less than two months to get y'all thing together 
 Good luck 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Show me what you got, lil mama 
 Show me what you got, pretty lady 
 Show me what you got, shorty 
 Show me what you got, baby 
 Hands up and waves, waves, waves, waves 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the most incredible 
 H-O, uh huh 
 H-O, uh huh 
 He's back 
 Justin Blaze 
 Blazettes 
 Roc-A-Fella Records 
 Dynasty continues, y'all die 
 Uh huh, peace![Intro] 
 Catch up, niggas 
  
 [Verse] 
 Damn you fadin' Hov', how you gave 'em that? 
 Audemar Piguet with the alligator strap 
 Sick of y'all niggas with ya now or later raps 
 Rap about it now, hope you get it later 
 Do a couple shows, hope you niggas is savin' up 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 But this particular watch be a one of one 
 That means none before it, none to come 
 The homie that's rappin' be the only one that has it 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 You ain't heard? I push the six when the fives is out 
 You can't fight me, in the Porsche I'll box you out 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 We don't drive X5s we give 'em to baby-mammas 
 Push the big top that shaped like a Kansas chicken snack box 
 I get it crackin' when I'm backin' out the garage 
 A 360 drop Ferrar', shutdown manhattan 
 Bucket low, like fuck it, though 
 Nikes on, daytime, lights on, hell yeah I'm frontin' but you love it, though 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 Nigga I'm a check writer, you're royalty recievers 
 Y'all eatin' off Per Diem, on the low like a caesar 
 Pay ya taxes, y'all niggas hustlin' backwards 
 I cop and crash whips, Jay is a bastard 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 How you want it, my jeans is 300 
 These ain't Diesel, nigga, these is Evisu 
 Top is Roc, you know the rest 
 A big bucket of frozen water on my chest 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON) 
 Listen man, get a crate, some crack, and some house slippers 
 A newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up 
 Or get a gun, a mask, an escape route 
 Some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house 
 And ma don't give him nothin', unless he's treatin' you special 
 Soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you 
 And when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair 
 Just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS HON) 
 Look, think big, fuck gettin' your nails done 
 Think cars, cribs, jewels, some shit for your son 
 Don't let 'em give you, hard dick and bubble gum 
 Make him cop the Lex bubble, 2001 hon 
 (I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS HON) 
 And if your man got you baggin' up, it could be worse 
 Just put a little in the baggy, put a little in the purse[Verse] 
 So I’m the bad guy now I hear, because I don’t go with the flow 
 Don’t ever go with the flow, be the flow 
 And I don’t need no middle man to talk to my niggas 
 I understand if you don’t understand, I figure I’m Jigga 
 That’s where we differ 
 I take what’s mine, you accept what they give you, I get you 
 I don’t take no checks I take my respect 
 Pharrell even told me go with the safest bet 
 Jimmy Iovine offered a safety net 
 Google dangled around a crazy check 
 I feel like YouTube is the biggest culprit 
 Them niggas pay you a tenth of what you supposed to get 
 You know niggas die for equal pay right? 
 You know when I work I ain't your slave right? 
 You know I ain't shucking and jiving and high fiving 
 You know this ain't back in the days right? 
 But I can't tell, how the way they killed Freddie Gray right 
 Shot down Mike Brown how they did Tray right? 
 Let them continue choking niggas 
 We gon' turn style, I ain't your token nigga 
 You know I came in this game independent right? 
 TIDAL, my own label, same difference 
 Oh niggas is skeptical when it's their own shit 
 You bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich 
 Phil Knight worth trillions you still bought those kicks 
 Spotify is nine billion they ain't say shit 
 Lucy you got some 'splaining to do 
 The only one they hating on look the same as you 
 That's cool, I know they trying to bamboozle you 
 Spending millions on media trying to confuse you 
 I had to talk to myself, Hov you used to it 
 It's politics as usual[Hook] 
 Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter) 
 And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter) 
 Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up) 
 History so loved, so long, so long, so long… 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 In search of victory, she keeps eluding me 
 If only we could be together momentarily 
 We could make love, and make history 
 Why won’t you visit me, until she visits me 
 I’ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat 
 She gives me agony, so much agony 
 She brings me so much pain, so much misery 
 Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees 
 As the crowd screams, for the other team 
 I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave 
 I know what this means, I’m stuck in this routine 
 Whole new different day, but the same old things 
 All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see 
 Nobody else believes, nobody else but me 
 Where are you victory? I need you desperately 
 Not just for the moment, to make history 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 So now I’m flirting with death 
 Hustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching 
 Took chances repeatedly 
 As a teenage boy, before acne 
 Before I got proactive, I couldn’t face she 
 I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets 
 I swear I met success, we lived together shortly 
 A success is like lust, she's good for the touch 
 She's good for the moment, but she’s never enough 
 Everybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V 
 A success is all I got, unfortunately 
 But I’m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's 
 But something tells me that there’s much more to see 
 Before I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed 
 So before me, success and death ménage 
 I gotta get lost, I gotta find V 
 We gotta be together to make history 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet 
 She’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me 
 We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly 
 We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me 
 He’s my legacy, son of my hard work 
 Future of my past, he’ll explain who I be 
 Rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3 
 If I ain’t number one then I failed you victory 
 Ain’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks 
 Ain’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave 
 I wanna be remembered long after you grieve 
 Long after I’m gone, long after I breathe 
 I leave all I am, in the hands of history 
 That's my last will testimony 
 This is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower 
 I’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours[Intro: Beanie Sigel] 
 Damn, how am I gonna say this shit? 
 Hey... hey dad, yeah it's your boy 
 Remember me? I wanna talk to you, scrap 
  
 [Verse 1: Beanie Sigel] 
 I remember being kicked out the house 'cause I looked just like you 
 Said I'd be nothing but a crook—just like you 
 The niggas in the hood was shook? Well they just liked you 
 'Cause all they said was little Whitey look 
 I'm just like you, but dog I can't see it at all, shit 
 We never kicked it at all, we never pitched or kicked at a ball 
 Dog, you never taught me shit 
 How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat, none of that sorts of shit 
 Nigga you was an abusive pops 
 Fuck, you left me out to dry, stuck 
 Gotta teach News to box, gotta teach News to to block 
 And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach News the block 
 It's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down) 
 Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons 
 How they grew to be men and father they sons 
 Father they daughters—nigga, you left a fatherless daughter 
 I never follow your orders 
 Nigga you make me sick, pussy, you could... ooh 
 How you gon' leave these memories in the back of my mind? 
 I can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom 
 I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9 
 Put it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine 
 You turned me out, the reason why I hit the block 
 Reason why I tried to hit them cops 
 Reason why I started hitting shots 
 Reason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court 
 Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught 
 Look at your hands, man—damn you fought 
 Nigga you left my mom 
 Left us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry 
 You left us with no letters, notes, no replies (nothing!) 
 No digits, numbers was unlisted 
 You left us with some of my loneliest nights 
 Nigga, some of my hungriest nights 
 Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrassing) 
 Damn, we used to think money was white 
 Yeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant 
 We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps 
 And to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop... shit 
  
 [Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)] 
 Daddy, where have you been? 
 (And when you come home, you got us here all alone) 
 Mommy, where daddy went? 
 (You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him) 
 Mommy, what happened then? 
 (Who was you cheating on him? 
 Why he's always beating on you?) 
 Daddy, where have you been? 
 (Nigga, you gon' hear me out) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I wanted to walk just like you (remember?) 
 Wanted to talk just like you (word) 
 Often momma said I look too much 
 And I thought just like you (and I'd get happy) 
 Wanted to drink Miller nips and smoke Newports just like you 
 But you left me, now I'm going to court just like you 
 I would say "my daddy loves me and he'll never go away" 
 Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday? 
 Do you even remember the tender boy 
 You turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan? 
 Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one 
 Always short with the income, always late with the rent 
 You said that you was coming through, I would stay in the hallway 
 Always playing the bench (waiting) and that day came and went 
 FUCK YOU very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain 
 But I'm stronger and trust me, I will never hurt again 
 Will never ask mommy "Why daddy don't love me? 
 Why is we so poor? Why is life so ugly? 
 Mommy, why is your eyes puffy? 
 Please don't cry everything'll be alright 
 I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light 
 It's us against the world, we don't need him, right?" (Right!) 
 Mommy driving 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah) 
 I bought a nice home for both of my sisters now 
 We doing real good, we don't miss you now 
 See how life twists around, fucker? 
  
 [Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)] 
 Daddy, where have you been? 
 (And when you come home, you got us here all alone) 
 Mommy, where daddy went? 
 (You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him) 
 Mommy, what happened then? 
 (Who was you cheating on him? 
 Why he's always beating on you?) 
 Daddy, where have you been? 
 (Nigga, you gon' hear me out)[Intro] 
 Whooo! Whooo! 
  
 [Hook] 
 Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la 
 Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la 
 Neptunes tracks smoke like la la la 
 It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby (C'mon) 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come hang with me, basically 
 Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I know my English ain't as modest as you like 
 But come, get some, you little bums 
 I take the cake from under the baker's thumb 
 I bake the cake and two it up from one 
 Then I moved the weight like I'm Oprah, son 
 Uhh, I show you how to do this son 
 Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry patterns 
 Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden 
 He patterns his-self, the rap JFK 
 You wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis, then 
 Hop ya ass out that S-Class 
 Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask 
 Have you in your long-legged life 
 Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice? 
 Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice 
 'Cause this gat that I clutch gotta little red light 
 Need a light? 
  
  
 [Hook 2] 
 (To smoke that la la la) 
 Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la 
 Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la 
 It's the Roc, mami; sing our lullaby 
 C'mon 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come hang with me, basically 
 Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo 
 Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos 
 All attracted to Hov because they know dough 
 When they see him, whips be European 
 If you're a 10 chances you're with him 
 If you're a 5 you know you riding with them 
 Sick with the pen, nigga -- no physician in the world could fix him 
 No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction 
 He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching 
 You can't rain dance on his picnic 
 No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens 
 Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board 
 You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4 
 This ain't Chris Rock, bitch -- it's the Roc, bitch 
 And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket 
 Yao Ming? 
  
 [Hook 3] 
 Still smoking that la la la 
 Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la 
 Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45 
 It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby 
 C'mon 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come hang with me, basically 
 Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Forget English, talk body language 
 I be all over mamis like body paint is 
 Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist 
 Please excuse yourself, you're very sick 
 Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch 
 Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life 
 Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack 
 Forty-five gun smoke, choke off that 
 Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that 
 Plus the Feds tapping my music -- y'all get all that? 
 I'm the public industry #1 
 Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!) 
 Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you 
 That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way 
 But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future 
 I never make the news again, my man'll shoot ya 
  
 [Hook 4] 
 As we smoke that la la la 
 Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la 
 Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45 
 It's the Roc, bitch; sing our lullaby 
 C'mon 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come hang with me, basically 
 Hold up -- skip all the singing let's get right tonight, mami[Intro] 
 (I done gotten in trouble again) 
 What the fuck 
 I tried, man, I'm back 
 Peace to [?] 
 (I done gotten in trouble again) 
 Yeah 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Now the singer Rob calls the police on me 
 Y'all niggas ran out and copped the CD 
 See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers 
 I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody 
 See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know 
 These young'uns crossed the line with Hov', I'm letting it blow 
 Had the papers writing stories like: "Didn't they know? 
 This what happen when they made that rapper CEO" 
 I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate 
 Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks 
 And my conscience go, "You escaped the RICO 
 Why throw everything away over ego?" 
 You paper chasing, they paper hating 
 Billionaire Hov', you on the pace to make it 
 Fuck that, exclamation, comma 
 Quotation's "I love drama," period 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Smelling like Patron, singing dirty rap songs 
 Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn' 
 Every day it's the same, I said in Blueprint 
 That I'd never change, it's just a part of the game 
 Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec 
 But expect me to bug, it's in my blood 
 But if my chick leave me she gon' leave me for something 
 She gon' leave me cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing 
 Picture me getting up with something sleazy 
 Something, something, so easy 
 You could take out of Speed like nothing 
 Soon as you finish cutting, you like, "leave me please" 
 Not me, I need Angelina Jolie-zy comfort 
 So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B 
 That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free 
 Not to say that anything is wrong with Free 
 Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me 
 If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing 
 I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring 
 If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing 
 I'ma take... (*laughs*) y'all know what I mean 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Unh, you lil' niggas ain't deep you dumb 
 You niggas ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggas 
 Hock-too, spew lil' niggas 
 I can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas 
 But in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy 
 I *phew, phew* lil' niggas with the latest toy 
 Unlike you, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-ass man 
 Big shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants 
 Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents 
 It's apparent you're staring at a legend who 
 Put a few lil' niggas in their place before 
 Tryna eat without saying their grace before 
 Blasphemous bastard, get your faith restored 
 You're viewing your version of the Lord 
 God MC, lil' nigga, applaud, or 
 Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all 
 I rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish 
 I'll roof you, lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist 
 Cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class 
 Substitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath 
 I mute you, lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga 
 I child abuse you, lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga 
 Now shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play 
 'Cause the day I lose to you lil' niggas, no day 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change 
 I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end 
 We're all the same, all the same 
 I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga 
 I'm never gonna change, gonna change[Intro: Lenny Kravitz] 
 Yeah it's magic 
 Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz 
 And it's a Heavy D production you bastards 
 Come on 
 Ha, hey yo stop playing man 
 This is real serious 
 Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo 
 Let's go 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Let's go 
 Post Positano, Hov' hanging with Bono 
 U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo 
 And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano 
 If you, too, flow like you was out of your mind yo 
 'Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonald's 
 Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know 
 And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA 
 Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away 
 Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play 
 They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way 
 But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day 
 You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today 
 Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay 
 I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way 
 Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action 
 They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen 
 Let's go 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)] 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 Let's rock 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit 
 You got it Kris-crossed ain't no turning me backwards 
 Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions 
 Of one individual, he's criminally attached 
 I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors 
 By dating all the models and actresses 
 I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio 
 Trying not to mess up my axis kid 
 On the road to the riches through trafficking 
 Through rapping and whatever's happening 
 Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren 
 Every time I get out they put me right back in 
 The Michael Corleone of the microphone 
 The Michelangelo of flow, I paint pictures with poems 
 I gather no moss like a rolling stone 
 In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)] 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) Let's rock (c'mon) 
  
 [Chorus: Lenny Kravitz] 
 Life is all about Guns and Roses 
 Bittersweet like friends and foes is 
 Some get left behind and some get chosen 
 Just like life, Guns and Roses 
  
 Life is all about Guns and Roses 
 Bittersweet like friends and foes is 
 Some get left behind and some get chosen 
 Just like life, Guns and Roses 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is 
 Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go) 
 Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain 
 In order to experience joy you need pain 
 Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain 
 You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain 
 The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain 
 A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again 
 Everything evens up, you just wait 
 Even a garbage can gets a steak 
 You ain't even a garbage can you have faith 
 But when it turns your way before it turns away 
 Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay 
 You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay, let's go 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)] 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) It's the Roc 
 (C'mon) That's right (c'mon) 
  
 [Chorus: Lenny Kravitz] 
 Life is all about Guns and Roses 
 Bittersweet like friends and foes is 
 Some get left behind and some get chosen 
 Just like life, Guns and Roses 
  
 Life is all about Guns and Roses 
 Bittersweet like friends and foes is 
 Some get left behind and some get chosen 
 Just like life, Guns and Roses 
  
 [Outro: Lenny Kravitz] 
 Life is all about Guns and Roses[Intro] 
 I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P 
 Without the boy H.O.V 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
 When kingdom come, you ready? 
 When kingdom come, I'm ready 
 When kingdom come I'm ready 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back 
 Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac 
 Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat 
 Get your swag back daddy where your focus at 
 Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap 
 But despite that the boy is back 
 And I'm so evolved I'm so involved 
 I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge 
 I'm CEO and yeah glory to God 
 I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded 
 Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart 
 Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark 
 I been up in the office you might know him as Clark 
 But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart 
 I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie 
 Step inside the booth Superman is alive 
  
 [Hook] 
 The King Of New York New York 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
 When kingdom come, you ready? 
 When kingdom come, uh huh 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I hear "hurry up Hov" when I'm out in the public 
 Cause niggas like: "but you love it; you be it, you're of it 
 "You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas" 
 Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this 
 C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out 
 Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out 
 Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead 
 Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking 
 I thought dudes remark was rude okay 
 So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé 
 And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know 
 But I first had to take care of the world I know 
 I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom 
 Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him 
 Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark 
 Peter Park, Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts 
  
 [Hook] 
 The King Of New York New York 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
 When kingdom come, you ready? 
 When kingdom come, uh huh 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Just when they thought it was all over 
 I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders 
 The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that 
 Guess what New York, New York - we back 
 And I ain't never been afraid of a drought 
 Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South 
 Bout it, bout it, Master P 
 Ask the nigga Pimp C 
 Ask my homie Bun B 
 I run the streets the streets don't run we 
 Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep 
 I repeat, sing a long with me 
 I run the streets, the streets don't run we 
 Ladies saying "Where you been Superman?" 
 When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands 
 The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear 
 When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah! 
  
 [Hook] 
 The King Of New York New York 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor 
 When kingdom come, you ready? 
 When kingdom come, uh huh 
 Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior 
 So after this flow you might owe me a favor[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, Swizz Beatz 
 It's almost over y'all 
 Jigga, how real is that? 
 Uhh, uhh, uhh, lights out niggas! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Eve)] 
 (Jigga) What's my motherfuckin' name?

 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO?

 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah.. yeah.. 
 From the crap tables down in A.C 
 Back on the block, Jay-Z motherfucker from the, the, the Roc 
 Went solo on that ass but it's still the same 
 Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs 
 B. my niggas was strugglin', to the 'burbs they came 
 And then we got to hustlin', murderin' thangs 
 I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain 
 Now I'm Titanic, Iceberg's the name 
 Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game 
 The best way to describe me in a word, insane 
 I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame 
 Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain 
 The God, send you back to the earth from which you came 
 I'm bakin' soda, water, fire, merged with 'caine 
 Ladies don't know me said, "I heard he's vain." 
 Well, guess what, mami? I heard the same 
 You heard the name 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Eve)] 
 (Jigga) What's my motherfuckin' name?

 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, uhh, I got a 
 License to kill so I steer the Gat 
 Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggas scared of that 
 Got a new motto this year, "Don't Fuck With My Ones" 
 Knock on your door, three in the mornin' 
 "It's just us and the guns!" 
 See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns 
 I got the, mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy 
 Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity 
 Fo'-five rapidly, lift your chest cavity 
 Streets won't let me chill 
 Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill 
 Muh'fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain y'all 
 Raw the one, like five divided by four 
 Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all 
 Reciprocated and multiplied by more 
 You likely to see Jigga in a widebody or 
 Drop-top Bentley Azure, holla at me y'all, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Eve)] 
 (Jigga) What's my motherfuckin' name? 
 (Jigga) And who I'm rollin' with huh? 
 (My niggas) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh 
 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO? 
 (Jigga) What's my motherfuckin' name? 
 (Jigga) And who I'm rollin' with huh? 
 (My niggas) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh 
 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should 
 'Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood 
 All black in the club, the outcome ain't good 
 Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could 
 'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash 
 'Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass 
 The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash 
 Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash 
 See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass 
 All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn they glad 
 Let me sit up in they whip til I launch it back 
 Snap they neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back 
 The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat 
 Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back 
 Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that 
 And e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon 
 Uh-huh uhh uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Eve)] 
 (Jigga) What's my motherfuckin' name? 
 (Jigga) And who I'm rollin' with huh?

 (My niggas) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh 
 Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right 
 (Jigga, haha)[Intro] 
 And it says, now the works of the flesh are manifest 
 Meaning, the things that are in the sinful nature 
 They always come to the surface 
 And when they come, when they come to the surface 
 They come to the surface as demons 
  
 [Refrain] 
 (All this work can pay off) 
 I just want all this work to pay off

 Just a boy from the hood that 
 Got my hands in the air 
 In despair don't shoot 
 I just wanna do good, uh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Pray your father's father wasn't touching his little daughter 
 Creating trans-generational trauma, that shit'll haunt ya 
 Pray your little cousin ain't fall from the place that you fall asleep 
 Of course it's hard for me 
 Nigga ain't dozed, I ain't washed in a week 
 I ain't changed clothes 'til the Black Album 
 Y'all rap about it, I'm wrestlin' in these streets 
 'Til I tapped out 'em, them niggas is WWE 
 Y'all can have that, I'm smack dab 
 In a hurricane of emotions 
 Can't even raise my little daughter, my little Carter 
 We call her Blue cause it's sad that 
 How can I be a dad that, I never had that 
 Shattered in a million pieces, where the glass at 
 I need a drink, shrink or something 
 I need an angelic voice to sing something 
 Bless my soul, extend your arms, I'm cold 
 Hold me for a half hour until I am whole, yeah 
  
 [Hook] 
 I am not poison, no I am not poison 
 Just a boy from the hood that 
 Got my hands in the air 
 In despair, don't shoot

 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Sick of hiding in holes and behind hyperbole 
 This is the real me unfold 
 Gangster is love, I'm thuggin', I'm huggin' 
 This is tougher than any gun that I raised 
 Any crack that I blazed, that was nothin' 
 Peeling back the layers, uncovering 
 Scars that never healed, I never kept it this real 
 I acted out, my life a stage, ten thousand people watchin' 
 Where's the little boy I knew? 
 I must have forgot him 
 Stuntin', of course we never grew 
 But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you 
 Stuntin', of course we never grew 
 But we're alone now and I'm singing this song...you 
  
 [Hook] 
 I am not poison, no I am not poison 
 Just a boy from the hood that 
 Got my hands in the air 
 In despair don't shoot 
 I just wanna do good, ah 
 I am not poison, no I am not poison 
 Just a boy from the hood that 
 Got my hands in the air 
 In despair don't shoot 
 I just wanna do good, uh 
 Alcohol in my room

 No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison

 Uh-uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh, uh-uhh 
 Uh-huh-UHH 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Career crook, nobody rep Brooklyn like me 
 Jigga Man, Volume 3, I'm back lookin' like me 
 Stop the presses, baby girls, drop your dresses 
 B-K lick a shot for Big Pop' in heaven 
 Ever since I came through, niggas got the impression 
 Everything I drop, out of the question, stop the guessin' 
 It's hot, flows provin' I pack 'cause my dough's movin' 
 My whole crew up in this muh'fucker 
 We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine 
 You'll be wearin' a black suit a long time 
 I put your crew in hard bottoms 
 The priest is like, "God's got him 
 He never did nuttin' to nobody but them boys shot him" 
 Brandish iron, outlandish buyin' 
 Bentley Coupes, not braggin' just simply the truth 
 We all from the ghetto, only difference, we go back 
 Back up in D&D on this Primo track, listen 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "Iceberg Slim, baby ride rims" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "You know him well..." "...by the name of Jigga" 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "You can love me or hate me..." "Jay-Z" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "Roc-A-Fella lock the whole block down" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Wednesday's I'm up in Shine, Cheetah's Monday night 
 I'm fuckin' with the model chicks Friday night at Life 
 So I'm cruisin' in the car with this bougie broad 
 She said, "Jigga-Man you rich, take the du-rag off" 
 Hit a U-turn, "Ma I'm droppin' you back off" 
 Front of the club, "Jigga why you do that for?" 
 Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch 
 Won't change for no paper plus I been rich 
 '88 been hustlin', linen been crushin' 'em 
 Women been fuckin' 'em, huh? 
 You see I live for the love of the street 
 Rap to the ruggedest beats 
 Hall closet cluttered with heat 
 I spit that murder-murder-murder 
 That Brook-Brook-a-Brooklyn shit, furthermore ma 
 We tote guns to the Grammys 
 Pop bottles on the White House lawn 
 Guess I'm just the same old Shawn 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "Iceberg Slim, baby ride rims" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "You know him well..." "...by the name of Jigga" 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "You can love me or hate me..." "Jay-Z" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "Roc-A-Fella lock the whole block down" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm from the M-to-the-A-baby-R-C-Y 
 So it's hard for me to let the larceny die 
 Niggas see me in the streets with no bodyguards 
 Just two big guns that'll body your squad 
 'Cause niggas be schemin' on me, probably are 
 Think Jigga's a joke, nigga? Hardy har 
 I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust 
 Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much 
 Magazines say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim 
 Still they put me on they cover 'cause I earn for them 
 Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him 
 'Cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them 
 I spit that murder-murder-murderous every time a verbalist 
 Iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in Menace 
 I'm ill, start to finish, I rip apart contenders 
 I'm hot.. hehehehe 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "Iceberg Slim, baby ride rims" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "You know him well..." "...by the name of Jigga" 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me 
 "You can love me or hate me..." "Jay-Z" 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
 "Roc-A-Fella lock the whole block down" 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me, uhh 
 I'm so gutter, ghetto girls 
 Hehehe, (uhh, uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh), yeah 
 Uhh, yeah, fuck, yeah, with me, yeah, beyotch, yeah 
 Jigga, yeah, Primo, yeah, gangsta, yeah, niggas, yeah 
 Brooklyn, yeah[Chorus: Sleepy Brown] 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 We arose, let's go 
 So Fresh, So Clean like 'Kast 
 Jay-Z be poppin' tags 
 Leavin' the mall with heavy bags 
 You know the boy got a love for the cash 
 Aw fuck, there he go again 
 Talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again 
 Yup! Can't hold it in 
 I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend 
 But, back when I was poorer then 
 You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend 
 But I was holdin', I was a roller then 
 I was a baller back then, all of that man 
 Fall back, I bought that 
 What would you do if you was in my shoes? 
 Leave dudes in the rearview 
 V-12 engine, corners spinnin' 
 Twinkies shinin', pinky ring 
 Armadale, nigga stinky stink 
 Top down, my cash is up 
 Gold chain, I don't give a fuck 
 Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma 
 That's right, you in luck ma 
 You see me cruisin' down, better step inside 
 Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride 
 First come, first served basis 
 You know Hov' be goin' to nice places 
 That's right, and I'm droppin' cash 
 Leave the mall with garbage bags 
 Gucci this, Prada that 
 Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags 
  
 [Chorus: Sleepy Brown] 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
  
 [Verse 2: Twista] 
 It's a party when I go up in the sto' 
 Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro' 
 Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill' 
 And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the flo' 
 Bag full of clothes, I remember havin' rocks in the hall 
 On the corner with the Glock by the balls 
 Servin' up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6 
 Then it's straight from the block to the mall 
 Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yo'self 
 When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag 
 Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off 
 To the lot and lay the paper down and cop that Jag 
 I got a closet full of ammunition and funds 
 Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans 
 Dro packs and Bo Jacks and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1s 
 No max for none 
 (When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough) 
 I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now 
 (Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up) 
 And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now 
 I be choppin' up cheddar with Kanye 
 Chop a little cheddar up with Jay 
 Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay 
 Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay! 
  
 [Chorus: Sleepy Brown] 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
  
 [Verse 3: Killer Mike] 
 Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin 'bout me 
 My throwback game is whiffle wicked 
 Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n 
 Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin New Era fitted 
 White boys say my style is bitchin', keepin' coke in the kitchen 
 Keep a Glock that will shock and bring the rest 
 Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness 
 (HA!) Scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon 
 It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan 
 Extra clips and shells in the lambskin 
 Two deep by Pelle Pelle 
 Westside how they felly fell 
 More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather 
 Worn by the great Rakim himself 
 Stitch my Dapper Dan, oh man with the gun in hand 
 I leave your blood squirtin' 
 No offense, I'll put your face on the chest 
 Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings 
 I been fuckin', a hustle, married to a racket 
 Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets 
 I slept with a package, under mattress 
 I carry guns heavy speak easy, slight with the fight words 
 I'll put somethin hot through your motherfuckin' Iceberg 
 Got a project chica, named Rica 
 She keep a purse full of dro' reefer 
 Small, pinkies like that, talk 'til the paper fat 
 I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat! 
  
 [Chorus: Sleepy Brown] 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
  
 [Verse 4: Big Boi] 
 Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse 
 Leave you layin' on your back in a Cadillac hearse 
 Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse 
 I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts 
 What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall 
 Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off 
 Trot to the mailbox expectin a check but the mail's run short 
 No more MD, DD, LD, that means Movie Date 
 Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please 
 My sheets is gone 
 Long bread to the short bread, word is bond 
 Meticulously pimpously serve the song 
 Act a damn donkey 
 Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home 
 Drop top rag-o with the weed gone 
 Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chill'uns 
 Spent a few shillings 
 Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin' 
 A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and 
 Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs 
 Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done 
 Slowed, down, just a lil bit, dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit 
 Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit, dead game is the pul-pit 
 Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped 
 Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin', a miracle happenin' 
 Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and smabbin' 
 Pop that tag on some of this game 
 Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change 
  
 [Chorus: Sleepy Brown] 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags! 
 And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught 
 And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought 
 And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags 
 'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags![Chorus: Bilal] 
 I know I should've did that 
 I know it's gon' come right back 
 I know it's gon' destroy everything I made 
 It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
 But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
 It's inevitable that I'm... (fallin') 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started 
 When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with 
 Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like: 
 "Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try" (try) 
 Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips 
 But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip 
 The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it 
 Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is 
 Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit 
 Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless 
 Front row fight night, see how big my tube is 
 Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is? 
 But there's a price for overdoing it 
 Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax 
 Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back 
 Damn... 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)] 
 I know I should've did that 
 I know it's gon' come right back 
 I know it's gon' destroy everything I made 
 It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
 But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
 It's inevitable (now ya) fallin' 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 When you should've fell back 
 Now you (fallin'), right into they lap 
 Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen 
 Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene 
 Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino 
 You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat 
 Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods 
 Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards 
 Now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling 
 Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin') 
 Now let's pray that arm candy 
 That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy 
 'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow 
 And your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal 
 Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil 
 Damn, gravity's ill... 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)] 
 I know I should've did that 
 I know it's gon' come right back 
 I know it's gon' destroy everything I made 
 It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
 But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
 It's inevitable (but ya) fallin' 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 And you can't get up 
 All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up 
 Locked down the town now belongs to the squares 
 Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there 
 And your arm candy sweet on 'em 
 And the women that you left for this heifer 
 Got a college degree coming 
 Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach 
 You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin') 
 But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes 
 Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do 
 But that's old school to the new crew 
 They doing numbers like Sudoku 
 They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable 
 They'll experience déja vu too 
 Fight and you'll never survive 
 Run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace 
 Damn... 
  
 [Chorus: Bilal] 
 I know I should've did that 
 I know it's gon' come right back 
 I know it's gon' destroy everything I made 
 It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
 But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
 It's inevitable that I'm 
  
 [Outro: Bilal] 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin' 
 Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'[Intro] 
 You are tuned in 
 To the greatest 
 Young H-O-V 
 Let's go get 'em again, Just 
 (Oh my God, HOV) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of 
 Joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle 
 Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul 
 But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo 
 Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood 
 First niggas hating on me, it's all good 
 I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links and Gucci gooses 
 Watching too many movies, bulletproof this 
 Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses 
 When you're 16, coming through roofless 
 Yea your boy "ruthless", like Ice Cube was 
 Turn the whole city on, I'm the new plug 
 So if this is your first time hearing this 
 You're about to experience someone so cold 
 A journey seldom seen, the American dream 
 From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They gunning for me, wanna see me fall 
 You know my story, I've been through it all 
 Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying 
 What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron 
 Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now I'm knee deep in the concrete 
 Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep 
 I got a "chemical romance", two left feet 
 So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D 
 Save me from the "black parade", release me 
 My life like Grand Theft Auto, PSP 
 I'm in that Volvo, puffing on that la-la 
 Ducking from the po-po, every time I drive by 
 Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like 
 "Mmm, mmm, mmm" would you just look at him 
 So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment 
 But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again 
 Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in 
 And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am) 
 I'm feeling like the world's against me Lord 
 Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They gunning for me, wanna see me fall 
 You know my story, I've been through it all 
 Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying 
 What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron 
 Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now these baby ballers, toy rappers 
 Callin out my name to bring the boy backwards 
 Shooting air-balls at the basket 
 What you call money, I pay more in taxes 
 I got crowned king down in Africa 
 Out in Nigeria, do you have any idea 
 Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea 
 Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzania 
 Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli 
 Still got time to give water out to everybody 
 Everybody, fall back 
 Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting 
 CNN, you see it's accurate 
 ESPN, see me in action 
 Monday night's, when the half ends 
 When you 10 years in, holla back then 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They gunning for me, wanna see me fall 
 You know my story, I've been through it all 
 Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying 
 What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron 
 Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov) 
  
 [Outro] 
 (Good Lord, good Lord, good Lord 
 Good Lord, I said I feeeeeeeeeeeel like I'm dyiiiiiiiing)[Intro: Sheek Louch] 
 Fuck -- shit is real right here 
 Roc-A-Fella, LOX, taking the streets over motherfuckers 
 Don't get it twisted 
  
 [Verse 1: Sheek Louch] 
 Yo, ayo, ayo, ayo 
 Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass 
 With no mask, look at the camera like what? 
 Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed 
 To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy 
 Drop 100 bars for real like I'm looking for a deal 
 If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids 
 I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bids 
 And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fucking care 
 If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs 
 Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children 
 But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building 
 'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores 
 Jet-skiing, while you keep warm at corner stores 
 I make it hot, flooding your block, the best way 
 Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray 
 As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall 
 Taking shots of Louie 'til I fall 
 Nutting to lose, just load the clip up in the groove 
 And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear Big moved 
 My team, you would think was on Thorazine 
 How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing 
  
 [Verse 2: Beanie Sigel] 
 Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now 
 Pick out a quiet town and tie it down 
 Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now 
 Beanie Mac, I supply it now 
 My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats 
 Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps 
 Bag enough coke to last a few weeks 
 In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats 
 You really wanna test my name? And test my game? 
 Until you have me, test my aim? 
 Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles 
 Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule 
 Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walking 
 Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparking 
 Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparkling 
 Cop off the lot never see me at the auction 
 Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawking 
 Out on the strip, until I reach the margin 
 Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct 
 Eating cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend 
 Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans 
  
 [Verse 3: Jadakiss] 
 Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box 
 Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops 
 You feeling The LOX, nigga, why you grilling The LOX? 
 If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot 
 You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family 
 Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami 
 Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper 
 Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper 
 I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag 
 You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it 
 Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce 
 Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce 
 They got me where I can't be without my large gat 
 Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat 
 Don't matter if I'm opening up, or headline 
 Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines 
 Six months in the county or fed time 
 I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime 
 Anything I'm on is a classic 
 Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard 
 Anytime I spit, spit acid, L-O-X 
 Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered 
  
 [Interlude: Pain In Da Ass] 
 I told you the pain was coming 
 You wouldn't listen 
 You tried to play me like a joke? 
 Now who got the last laugh? 
 Now take these bullets with you to hell 
  
 [Verse 4: Sauce Money] 
 You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit 
 So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick 
 Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy 
 Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die 
 What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew 
 I fuck to win, y'all niggas coming to lose 
 Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off 
 I lay off wack niggas and kill 'em on my day off 
 Ain't nutting for me to bust a trey off 
 Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off 
 Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews 
 Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews 
 Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch 
 Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with 
 I'm a mil stacking nigga who pull quick, still packing 
 For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit 
  
 [Verse 5: Styles P (Jay-Z)] 
 I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are 
 I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car 
 I don't care about your block and whoever you shot 
 I don't care about your album and whenever it drop 
 I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked 
 I'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash 
 Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas 
 Shooting backwards, just for practice 
 Ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket 
 'Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you 
 Tell the whole world I'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you 
 I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock 
 My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock 
 I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven 
 You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me 
 I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-A-Fella 
 Screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella 
  
 [Verse 6: Jay-Z] 
 I know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers 
 Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma 
 Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta 
 Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna 
 Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners 
 Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon 
 Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed 
 Get brain in the four dot six Range 
 Shit mayne, switch lanes 
 Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine 
 Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain 
 Muh'fuckas is nodding and throwing up, you know that 
 You don't wanna owe that man 
 He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak, man 
 Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more 
 I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law 
 How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses? 
 We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga 
 Multiple cars and divas with D-Classes 
 Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic 
 Shit, beatch! What the fuck, ya heard me? Hahahaha 
 Put some more beat on that joint[Intro] 
 And you say New York City 
 Uh-huh 
 Put your hands together 
 Young! 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah, uh-huh 
 Yes! (Yes!) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm from the '80s 
 Home of the her-on 
 Era of the hustlers, uh 
 The world is my custies 
 New Rich Porter 
 The way I flip quarters 
 Front on all these other rap artists, but me 
 Momma was a mink wearer, papa ran numbers 
 So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from 
 American dream, I'm living the life still 
 Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill 
 Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining 
 40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on 
 My best friend's gone 
 I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on 
 Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on 
 I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on 
 So I get on that fly shit I been on 
 Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on 
 But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia 
 Give me amnesia 
 I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga 
 I want the sky 
 The world when I'm done 
 I'm give it to my sons 
 Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh 
 Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done 
 The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame 
 A list of hits next to all my names 
 I came 
  
 [Bridge] 
 (Woo!) uh-huh (geah) 
 I want the sky baby 
 I want the sky baby 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 If the sky should fall 
 And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house 
 And auction off all my cars 
 Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the Beamer 
 Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia 
 In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club 
 Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love 
 Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime 
 Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine 
 And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope 
 Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes 
 Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's 
 Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo 
 Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though 
 What don't kill me makes stronger than before so 
 Here we go and I'm not Domino 
 When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw 
 I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand 
 Yeah, that's my goal 
 And then I bid you Freddy Adu 
 Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture 
 Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle 
 My name will be viewed such 
 Here's to the man that refused to give up 
 I want the sky nigga, chuuurch 
  
 [Outro] 
 I want the sky baby 
 I want the sky baby[Intro] 
 Can you hear me now? Good! (Blueprint 2 baby!) 
 The best of times, it was the worst of times (aoww) 
 It's "The Gift & the Curse" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 R.O.C. yeah, number one clique here 
 If you represent us, throw them diamonds up YEAH 
 Now let's be clear, I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Now that you know, holla at your boy 
 HOV'.. (Hov', Hov', Hov')

 [Overlapping first Chorus] 
 Yeah, Roc-A-Fella Records

 We ain't goin' nowhere, put your diamonds up 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Standin' in my b-boy stance 
 Free, Beans, Memphis where you at nigga? 
 (Right here) snatch Cam and it's a wrap 
 This here rap belong to us, nobody strong as us, it's a fact 
 Hold up I'm just warmin' up, gimme a second to get it back 
 Young Chris, Neef what? Oschino and Sparks 
 Next summer's yo' summer, tear this motherfucker up 
 Young is eternal, my youngins'll burn you 
 "The Blueprint" birthed, nigga I earthed you, you can't be serious 
 Young 'cause I'm thirty-two, dressed like I'm twenty-two 
 Flow like a 18, do what I wanna do 
 Goin on my 8th ring, got Phil Jackson's Zen 
 Flow is black magic, I'm at it again 
 Rose Gold with black karats, Horse & Carriage to spend 
 Like Mason Betha, chasin' this cheddar to the end 
 Of the road because the end I'm told is nearer than we know 
 What can I say but live for today, HOV'! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 R.O.C. yeah, number one clique here 
 If you represent us, throw them diamonds up YEAH 
 Now let's be clear, I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Now that you know, holla at your boy 
 HOV'.. (Hov', Hov', Hov') 
 (Hov', Hov', Hov', Hov') 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yeah, The Blueprint 2 homie, follow the moves 
 You put on two tube socks, you couldn't walk in my shoes 
 I was dealt a bad hand, fuck what else could I do 
 But keep somethin' up my sleeve that'll help me through 
 But can you believe, everywhere I'm at, models come through 
 Cat-fightin', cat-walkin', it happens often 
 It's true how society don't want me to move 
 Into the penthouse building with spectacular views 
 They're like uhh, "He's a menace he could never be a tenant" 
 I'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do? 
 I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I don't 
 Give a fuck we just chillin' watchin' chandelier ceilings high as fuck 
 Old lady, don't blow my high 
 'specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring 
 Sharpton in it 'cause I'm dark-skinned-ed or 
 Dude with the 'fro and the Rainbow Coalition, I'ma 
 Victim of a single parent household, born in a mouse hole 
 Mousetrap, niggas wanna know 
 How so, how Jay get up out that, here, yeah 
 I snatched purses, I per-se-vered, yeah 
 I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear 
 I was out there sellin' hope for despair, but stop there 
 I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears 
 Had to get out the hood 
 And I can't justify genocide 
 But I was born in the city where the skinny niggas die 
 Born in the city where the skinny niggas ride 
 And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size 
  
 [Chorus] 
 R.O.C. yeah, number one clique here 
 If you represent us, throw them diamonds up YEAH 
 Now let's be clear, I ain't goin nowhere 
 Now that you know, holla at your boy

 By the way, yo..

 When we just cop them things homie, the chromey wheels 
 Both arms are chunky, the sleeves on chill 
 Any given times a hundred G's in your grill 
 Don't talk to me 'bout MC's got skills 
 "He's alright, but he's not real" 
 Jay-Z's that deal, with Sigs in the field 
 Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel 
 Fuck, you got a flow, that's cool with me 
 You got a little dough, that's cool with me 
 You got a little cars, little jewelries 
 But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me 
 You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees 
 'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V 
 Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be? 
 With that new blue Yankee on, who but me? 
 Niggas shipped two million, then I blew to three 
 Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour 
 I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same 
 Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang 
 I seen the same shit happen to Kane 
 Three cuts in your eyebrows tryin' to wild out 
 The game is ours, we'll never foul out 
 Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out 
 Throw yo' hands up - niggas, bitches, busters 
 Hustlers, fuck that! (Throw the hands up), c'mon 
  
 [Chorus: Amil (Jay-Z)]

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi 
 Drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie 
 Cutie, smelling like Miyake, half-Philippine thing 
 For now, let's call her Suki, got me, this booty banging 
 Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance 
 A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy 
 Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ 
 Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me 
 Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early 
 'Cause who's getting played is not me 
 "Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely 
 Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me" 
 I said maturely, "You right 
 But better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds 
 Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story 
 To make sure that you one of a kind 
 And you deserve to be my Sunshine" 
  
 [Chorus: Babyface (Jay-Z)] 
 Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh) 
 Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z (Foxy Brown)] 
 A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only 
 Hear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom 
 Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right) 
 Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm 
 Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh) 
 Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said 
  
 [Verse 3: Foxy Brown (Jay-Z)] 
 I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing 
 Hating 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me 
 We chose each other, you acting like you chose me 
 They oppose you then, they oppose me 
 We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery 
 Double cross you they got to triple cross me 
 (I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh 
 (One more thing: 
 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho' 
 (She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh 
 (Put that on everything?) I put that on my life 
 (Right) 
  
 [Chorus: Babyface (Jay-Z)] 
 Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh) 
 Touch me with, a smile of gold (uhh) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh) 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z (Foxy Brown)] 
 If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho') 
 Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho') 
 Pawn your jewelry to come get me? (You better know) 
 Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know) 
 They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh) 
 They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh) 
 (But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales 
 That you was, throwin' rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?) 
 This is the truth I shall, 'til the loot gets frail 
 I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale 
 Me and you balling, from the Heavens, or the Hell 
 Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself 
 Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf 
 It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt 
 From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine 
 Just continue to be my Sunshine, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Babyface (Foxy Brown)] 
 Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh) 
 Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh) 
 Touch me with, a heart of gold 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, ahh-haaa 
 Touch me with, a smile of gold 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine[Produced by Diddy, Sean C & LV] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Sweeeet... and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain...) 
 If I would have grew up to be a doctor 
 My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...) 
 But since I grew up through the game 
 And my influence is the same 
 And my therapy is music 
 They ask if you ashamed (ashamed...) 
 And though I wish I could separate the two things 
 I cannot so my answer to you remains 
 I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles 
 And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes 
 No shame, no sir 
 Just big boats and tearing the coast up 
 Tight coupes like I'm wearing the roadster 
 For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Hov', alright al-right 
 And it may not be what you call perfect, but 
 But it's my life (uh) 
 The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life 
 Once again it's the life 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 So I make no apologies, crooked policies 
 So a G a nigga gotta be 
 We playing for property, no Monopoly 
 So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me 
 They say the child shall lead 
 So I take it far as I can and then we shall see 
 Shall we dance with the devil for a beat 
 I pray to God I ain't got two left feet 
 Do the hustle put keys in the street 
 Then I'm ballroom dancing 
 Ke-ke'in in the suite 
 Sweet, BB's on the feet 
 TV's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep 
 It's so corrupt 
 Soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up 
 One day you're up 
 Next day you're down 
 Long as you stay the same it'll come back around 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Hov', alright al-right 
 And it may not be what you call perfect, but 
 But it's my life (uh) 
 The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life 
 Once again it's the life 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm even better 
 I'm eating better 
 Best thing about it is 
 My niggas eating together 
 With each endeavor, we reaching levels 
 Niggas ain't seen in like forever 
 I'm Hyman Roth, so made all my partners rich 
 I can't vouch for you 
 If you ain't a part of this 
 So pardon me as I pave my wrist, uh 
 As I parlay my chips 
 Hov', alright al-right 
 American gangster, gangster 
 Businesses like I'm white 
 But I'm not, I'm just bright 
 So fly with no fear of the flight, uhh 
 So if y'all hear my plight 
 And if you think you can make it this far without a fight 
 Couple mistakes here and there 
 Not always right, but I'm always real 
 That's how I sleep at night 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Hov', alright al-right 
 And it may not be what you call perfect, but 
 But it's my life (uh) 
 The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life 
 Once again it's the life

 Sweeeet...[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga! 
 Go head! Keep goin'! 
 I got some nice dresses for you guys 
 The incomparable H.O 
  
 [Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)] 
 Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes) 
 Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?) 
 Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered) 
 And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now) 
 Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

 Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I’m still here, mon frere! 
 I know the cross I bear 
 They like, “That’s why they call you Hov” 
 I’m like, “Yeah” 
 I’m like air, lil' shots go through me 
 Won’t tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue 
 Don’t cry for me 
 I peep these niggas from deep 
 Got a front row seat even if you don’t speak 
 Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear 
 Left a fingerprint, you ain’t gotta be there 
 I’m just waiting til’ you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in 
 Then I’m gon' body them 
 It's nothing but a hobby to him 
 Simple as a serve in volley to him 
 Niggas like, “Hov', why don’t you get at ol’ boy?” 
 Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive? 
 Why not wait to catch them all together? 
 That’s why you dig one big hole, one time 
  
 [Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)] 
 Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes) 
 Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 How is niggas dissin' me 
 I made it possible 
 For niggas to make history 
 How is this possible? 
 Please explain this shit to me 
 How is it logical? 
 Have we forgotten our history? 
 Let’s open our bibles 
 It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals 
 Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to 
 You let that man hype you to go against your idol 
 Knowing good and god damn well this what I do 
 Think I’m in the office, I’m off my grind? 
 That’s how kids become orphans 
 You lost ya mind? 
 I keep my enemies close 
 I give ‘em enough rope 
 They put themselves in the air 
 I just kick away the chair 
  
 [Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)] 
 Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes) 
 Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?) 
 Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)

 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Hov gon' get you, I ain’t forget your lil' disrespect 
 No ho, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said 
 It's hard to do when you’ve got nothing to prove 
 Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose 
 Cause even when you win, ultimately you lose 
 Real niggas like, “Why Hov talking to Dude?” 
 You sellin' low too, only time you went plat 
 My chain was on your neck, that’s an actual fact 
 So I’m prayin’ that it spills outside of the booth 
 That’s when ya’ll niggas outside of your truth 
 Outside of your league, that’s not what you do 
 Niggas throwin' Roc signs outside of your Coupe 
 Don’t look at Hov like he done something wrong to ‘em 
 Cause he’s on to 'em 
 He just took what belonged to him 
 You niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing Hov 
 This game is over, I don’t know if ya’ll know 
 You in the hole 
  
 [Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)] 
 Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes) 
 Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?) 
 Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered) 
 And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now)

 Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked 
 Overseas, at Panjabi MC and the Roc 
 I came to see the mamis in the spot 
 On the count of three, drop your body like it's hot 
 1, Young, 2, You 1,2,3 
 Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama 
 Make me wanna put the snake on ya 
 I'm on my 8th summer, still hot -- Young's the 8th wonder 
 All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder 
 I take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit 
 The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM 
 All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply 
 Attached to the track like SMPTE 
 It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood 
 Ni tu kari na kise de naal pyaar

 [Verse 2 : Jay Z] 
 Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov 
 From the U.S., you just lay down slow 
 Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands 
 Checking in daily under aliases 
 We rebellious, we back home 
 Screaming, "Leave Iraq alone!" 
 But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return 
 But only love kills war, when will they learn? 
 It's International Hov, been having a flow 
 Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow 
 Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow 
 Before I was cabbing it there back and forth 
 Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway 
 Cop one on consignment to give you more yay 
 Yea, but that's another stor-ay 
 But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

 Whoa-oh-oh ya-ya-ya-ya! 
  
 [Jay-Z] Geah.. 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z w/ the R. Kelly above repeating in background] 
 He's a nigga from the back block 
 On everybody laptop who used to slang crack rock 
 HOV'! And this nigga from the Chi' 
 Who hold a note like the guy who said the British is comin 
 My nigga Kels! Oh yeah the niggas is comin 
 Get out your good dishes or somethin like it's Thanksgiving nigga 
 It's HOV'! And none other than the R 
 And without further adieu, like Freddie get ready it's 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Whatever happen Lord, don't send me back 
 And whenever I did wrong it was your name I cried 
 I heard you forgave over and over again 
 But when I found that out I became immune to my sins 
 Lay wide awake in the middle of my sleep 
 "I see dead people," and sometimes it's me Lord 
 I never wanted to be a Thugfather 
 I only wanted to be a son of a father 
 RAHH, that's how it sounds, it's sad 
 Worse than the war in Iraq when it's me against I 
 I gave up the weed and somehow I'm still high 
 Three years, still seein the weed in my eyes Lord 
 Sometimes I don't know what you want from me 
 But I do know you know what I want from you 
 GIVE IT TO ME! C'mon, take away this Hennessy 
 Take away me runnin the street 
 Stop people from HATIN me, take away all of this jealousy 
 And prejudicy 
 Thought you said it was a better place 
 I grew up around pimps, hustlers hoes and project gang-sters 
 Hard to BELIEVE in what I can't see 
 I gotta get this money and feed my family 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Whatever deity guides my life 
 Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight 
 But if I shall before I wake what shall I say? 
 It's been a good run from hoodlum to Island estates 
 How could one who made such foul mistakes 
 Still be allowed to have a smile on my face? 
 Hell, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder 
 In a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner 
 Now my life's straight like a perm 
 Try to take the spot I earned muh'fucker better learn 
 It's HOV'! 
  
 [Hook] - reverse Hov and Kels 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Hey boy hear me out, got a few mo' things to say 
 These niggas be chasin me like everyday 
 C'mere - NO! My life on crutches, devils say 
 I'll never walk again, but the devil is a liar 
 Cause I believe within, you're the reason that I'm still here 
 Even though I don't act like it 
 Even though I hear my calling and fight it 
 Fools do me so wrong, it's hard to stay righteous 
 If pimping was a mountain to heaven, I'd hike it 
 Believe me Lord, I want you 
 Got money and fame, and still it just won't do 
 Sometimes I don't like who I am 
 When I look in the mirror my reflection is Uncle Sam 
 And every night I have these weird dreams 
 That a creature's right beside me - wake up and can't breathe 
 I feel like it's twenty of me 
 Goin 20 different directions on a one-way street Lord 
 I got houses, money and cars and met 
 Every single superstar I, got the whole music industry sewed 
 But it still don't matter, when I'm gone and my casket closed, go! 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Whatever guillotine guides my life 
 Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight 
 But if I shall before I wake I'd accept my fate 
 I did what I did my heart was in the right place 
 I did so I could live to put food on my plate 
 You musta loved me not to let it end by 3 that day 
 Well, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder 
 In a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner 
 I guess I'm not finished with my journey 
 Please forgive me for my sins, shit I'm still trying to learn 
 Meet HOV'!

 And bring our soldiers home, let us pray

 You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)

 Yes, a lime to a lemon, my V-A women 
 Walk in Manolo Blahniks 'cause my condo with elevators in 'em 
 She wanna wrinkle my linens 
 So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin', uhh 
 Blasphemy, oh my God, every sentence 
 She keeps scratchin' me like she have tiger in her 
 This is exact-a-ly, why I had to pin her 
 To the bed like a wres-tl-er, had to pretzel her, uhh 
 Her man kept pagin', stressin' her 
 So I told her what to say just in case he question her 
 (Situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it) 
 No matter what you do, don't talk about us 
 Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it 
 Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again 
 Bring a friend!

 Half black, half white chick; I call her Minnie Mouse (wooo!) 
 We always hook up when we out 
 We do what we like to do and then we out 
 But lately I've been havin' the strangest feelings 
 Your boy Young Hov' catchin' feelings 
 And it's messin' up my dealings 'cause mami's not willin' 
 To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend 
 Said, we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a blast 
 She called me her emergency dick-in-a-glass 
 Hehehe, I had to laugh for a second 
 Had to check myself, get my mackin' back in perspective 
 I slack for a second but I'm back, no question 
 Like I walk with a cane, Ain't No Half-Steppin'

 Iceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon

 What the deal playboy, just rest your soul 
 I be holding it down yo, still love the dough 
 Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go 
 Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow 
 Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame 
 Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name 
 You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns 
 And just like your spirit the Commission remains 
 Niggas can cross the T's and, dots the I's 
 Now that I got too popular to cop them pies 
 I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise 
 Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise 
 Basics in the basement, wasted 
 Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit 
 My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign 
 And I let the world know that the city is mine, what? 
  
 [Chorus: Blackstreet and (Jay-Z)] 
 You belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)

 Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find 
 I'm like a brain in the voice box, I speak my mind 
 About to redefine rap mami, either I'm 
 The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it 
 I read a article that said I was ruining shit 
 But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick 
 So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split 
 And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es 
 Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit 
 Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit 
 I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit 
 On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit 
 How real is that? My floss game, still intact 
 Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that 
 Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89 
 And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what? 
  
 [Chorus: Blackstreet and (Jay-Z)] 
 You belong to the city (the city is mine) 
 You belong to the night (yeah, uhh, the city is mine) 
 In the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me) 
 He's a man of the night (yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough 
 Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough 
 I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks 
 Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6 
 Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent 
 Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what 
 So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt 
 At the bar alchoholing her up 
 I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream 
 A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth 
 Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name 
 I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game 
 From now until they blow holes in my frame 
 I'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me? 
 I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime 
 On the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine! 
  
 [Chorus: Blackstreet and (Jay-Z)] 
 You belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine) 
 You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine) 
 In the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine) 
 He's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine) 
 You belong to the city 
 You belong to the night 
 In the river of darkness 
 He's the man of the night 
  
 [Outro: Blackstreet] 
 You belong 
 You belong 
 In the river of darkness

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Ayo fuck y'all, niggas I crush y'all, rush y'all 
 With the four drawn and I touch y'all, plus y'all 
 Little motherfuckers ain't ready for war 
 I seen your team in a crisis before, thought I forgot? 
 The same rules apply, don't try to switch up your style 
 Y'all niggas is pumpkin pie, and that's plain as I 
 Much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that 
 This nigga ready for war, well where that fool at? 
 I bruise wack rap niggas severely punish them 
 Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh 
 Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew 
 I probably make more money off yo' album, than you 
 You see the respect I get every time I come through 
 Check your own videos, you'll always be number two 
 Niggas talking real greasy on them R&B records 
 Well I'm Platinum a million times nigga, check the credits 
 S. Carter, ghostwriter, and for the right price 
 I can even make YO' shit tighter 
 I roast niggas like ya, smoke niggas like ya 
 Take your little jewels and put the toast to niggas like ya 
 You know what the fuck we do and why we done it 
 How I bring it to niggas who, probably want it 
 Keep playing, you gone find me in your lobby blunted 
 And I don't even smoke nigga, ain't no joke 
 Niggas cat fighting with Jigga, kicking sneaky shit 
 Making little tapes but keeping it secret 
 'Cause I kick that deep shit that divide your peeps shit 
 Now I don't know if you fucking with Jigga 
 Spitting that weak shit, dog 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Niggas don't want it with Jig, 'cause something’s got to give 
 I got homes where you hide, I hustle where you live 
 Jigga's the Don, bitches scream "Jigga damn the 
 Dick is the bomb, about as thick as an arm" 
 Mr. Exxon, gas 'em with the wit and the charm 
 Bitch, I'm trying to tell you like Nicholas Barnes 
 I'm a big cat, listen mami, can you dig that? 
 Cars, jewelry, homes, I did that 
 O's, shootouts, keys, I live that 
 Actresses, models, chicken heads, hit that 
 I get stacks and still I kick back 
 And run up on niggas with the midac, where the shit at? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Time to separate 
 The platinum from the white gold, right from the door 
 The real from the fake, ready rock from the raw 
 The boss from the runners, cats who ride dick 
 From the cats with the numbers, the five from the six 
 I got cop ‘n crash money, pop the dash money 
 Press the button, all of sudden, Glock in the stash money 
 Beef with Jigga, watch yo' ass money 
 It's El Presidente, top brass money 
 Now I don't flash the steel, I blast for real 
 My motto: you only good as the last nigga you kill 
 I'm here to snatch this mil, nigga that's for real 
 If you rolling with me grab the wheel, let's ride huh? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many y'all wanna ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die[Intro: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 Sup Baby Girl (Ohhh) 
 Thought I had to talk to you again 
 Been a long time, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey) 
 Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you 
 Rashad is missing you, your Mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no) 
 Your Pop is missing you, Dame is missing you 
 Damn we missing you... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 All we listen to is all the different yous 
 Four page letters in addition to 
 Have you ever loved somebody who used to get the party poppin' 
 We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot 
 We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the Roc 
 We used to make up special names for the food we ate 
 Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates? (I miss you) 
 Well, Dame told me tell you, he's doin' well 
 Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue 
 But I ain't got to tell you, you looking over us 
 Our little angel, but you know what 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you 
 New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
 Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you 
 Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you 
 Damn we missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview 
 Now he's dissin' me, 'cause he dissed you 
 Can you believe the nerve of this dude 
 'cause of your memory I won't bring it to pistols 
 But he got issues, enough of that lame 
 I never seen pain like your parents' pain 
 But I know God's protecting you 
 You used to read Seat of the Soul, I know God perfecting you 
 All the extra hue, the darker texture you are, the more intellectual 
 You are so professional, our little purple star 
 Too good for earth you are (I miss you) 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you 
 D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
 Kidada's missing you, Shock is missing you 
 Carline is missing you, Tiny's missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 By the way, Big, we missing you, Pac, we missing you 
 We feel your presence just not in the physical 
 All across the world, blocks is miserable 
 Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous 
 But they not original and they not identical 
 They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews 
 I swear, in hip-hop, if it's not ten of you 
 Then it gotta be more; y'all left your paws 
 Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same 
 Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same 
 But I'm doing what I can man, and try to follow y'all down memory lane, man 
 Big, you'd be ashamed to see New York gang bang 
 Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain 
 But I guess that's the issue 
 And it proves how much niggas really miss you 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah) 
 Pun we missing you, Big L we missing you 
 Left Eye we missing you, Jay we missing you 
 Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on 
 The world is missing you, the hood is missing you 
 (Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you) 
 Know what I mean? Miss y'all (I miss you) 
 This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers 
 Soldiers and soldiettes, all across the world (I miss you) 
 We gon' hold y'all down, y'all living in our memories forever 
 We never gon' let y'all go 
  
 [Bridge: Aaliyah] + (Jay-Z) 
 I can't be no more (We not remembering your death, though) 
 Since you went away I don't really feel like talking (We celebrating your life, know what I mean?) 
 No one here to love me, baby do you understand me? (Yes, yes) 
 I can't do a thing without you (Yes) 
 (Damn, we missing you) 
  
 [Hook: Aaliyah] 
 It's been too long and I'm lost without you 
 What am I gonna do 
 Said I been needing you, wanting you 
 Said I need you 
 Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you 
 Is your heart still mine? 
 I wanna cry sometimes 
 I miss you[Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Uh, yo don't get mad at me 
 I don't love 'em, I fuck 'em 
 I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em 
 I replace 'em with another one 
 You had to see she keep calling me B.I.G 
 And my name is Jay-Z 
 She be all on my dick 
 Gradually I'm taking over your bitch 
 Coming over your shit 
 Got my feet up on you sofa, man 
 I eat a hostess from my open hand 
 You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans 
 I got your bitch in my Rover man 
 I never kiss her, I never hold her hand 
 In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man 
 I'ma pimp her, it's over man 
 (It's over man, it's over man...) 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott] 
 Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six? 
 With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips 
 Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride? 
 With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes 
 Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill 
 While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill? 
 Is that your bitch? Why she paging him? 
 Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch! 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me? 
 Room 112, hotel balcony 
 How she say Jay you can call the house for me? 
 There's no respect at all 
 You betta check her dawg 
 She keep beggin' me to hit it raw 
 So she can have my kids and say it was yours 
 How foul is she? And you wifed her 
 Shit, I put the rubber on tighter 
 Sent her home, when she entered home 
 You hugged her up 
 What the fuck is up? 
 She got you whipped, got your kids 
 Got your home, but that's not your bitch 
 You share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl 
 It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick 
 Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott] 
 Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six? 
 With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips 
 Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride? 
 With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes 
 Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill 
 While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill? 
 Is that your bitch? Why she paging him? 
 Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch! 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Cool out homie 
 You betta keep her away from my balling clique 
 Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix 
 From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks 
 From cats who order Cris' play the floor with the Knicks 
 It can only lead to something unfortunate 
 Hot boy like Jigga man scorch your bitch 
 Play the four dot, Jigga man go first 
 Then we all rock 'til we all hot 
 You know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock 
 Got the bitches in the smash 
 Make them drawers drop fast 
 'Cause we get more cash than the average nigga? 
 All dem hoes like damn I gotta have this nigga 
 'Cause I'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that? 
 You would fuck mine 
 How the hell can you knock that? 
 I'm just playing the cards choosenly 
 Jigga Man, who you supposed to be? 
  
 [Chorus: Missy Elliott] 
 Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six? 
 With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips 
 Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride? 
 With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes 
 Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill 
 While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill? 
 Is that your bitch? Why she paging him? 
 Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch! 
  
 [Verse 4: Twista] 
 Tha Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming 
 Like a demon fiending for the semen 
 Chrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan 
 Gone while I'm leanin' smoking 
 I'm whip it in the stomach 
 Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money 
 Why you acting so funny? 
 You know she been flirting while your working 
 Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain 
 Poppin' that pussy 
 Sweatin' till no fluid is left 
 When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death 
 You gon' ruin your rep 
 Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers 
 Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper 
 Must have been mad 
 When your ho put my stuff in the dash 
 Bust in her ass 
 To climax I come up with a nab 
 The game don't stop 
 Legit ballers bending up the block 
 Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props 
 Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put the dick up inside her 
 Can't help it if she's in love with a rider 
  
 [Bridge: Missy Elliott] 
 Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six? 
 With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips 
 Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride? 
 With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes 
 Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill 
 While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill? 
 Is that your bitch? Why she paging him? 
 Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo? 
 Is y'all niggas finished? 
 Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh 
 You finished nigga? Huh huh, y'all finished 
 Can I live, huh 
 Can I live, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, yo... yo I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out 
 Scream "what's that about?" then I clap out 
 I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten 
 Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on 
 Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice grilling it 
 Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant 
 Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off 
 I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire 
 I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in 
 Rookies blame it on the age difference 
 My subliminal flows, create criminal odes 
 Sing along if y'all with me, til the end of the road 
 I'm cynical, when in the view of the public 
 And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews 
 The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do 
 Check yourself, what percentage is you? 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z] 
 Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones 
 And black guns, stack ones yo 
 Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed 
 Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh? 
 Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs 
 Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo 
 Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight 
 Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth 
 But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth 
 Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given 
 Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in? 
 My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central 
 Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you 
 I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth 
 And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself 
 Ran into shorty bopping down the ave 
 On his way to clocking math then 
 He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said 
  
 [Verse 3: Memphis Bleek] 
 Ayo there's money out there I just got to have 
 When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass 
 Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh 
 How I think about school and it taught me not to grab 
 When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn 
 Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn 
 That credit you dead it 
 I know heads getting annoyed and knew all 
 About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines 
 Flipping boy and, using the right cut 
 One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump 
 This slab gotta re-up and re-bag 
 Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more 
 Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit 
 Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit 
 What you want nigga? What you want nigga? 
 What you want, what you want nigga? 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Can I live... 
 To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat 
 Trying to win with the construction Timbs yo 
 Can I live... 
 Yo USA, all my chicks that strip 
 Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in 
 All my chicks with the credit card scams 
 Two kids, one job, and no man 
 All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check 
 Haha, all the mamis dame un beso, alright 
 All my niggas rocking them fitted caps 
 Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean 
 All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license 
 I like that shit, I see y'all 
 All my niggas that say pause after they say some fucked up shit Hahahahaha, rock on and uh, Jigga shit, Roc-A-Fella forever yo 
 Uhh, Major Coins, yeah, uh-huh 
 Memph Bleek nigga, uh-huh uh[Intro: Paul Anka (Jay-Z)] 
 Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?) 
 So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain 
 (No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood) 
 (The REAL hood, like three pair of pants) 
 My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers) 
 (My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case 
 (Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain 
 (You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?) 
 I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin' 
 At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin') 
 (That's really somethin'!) And I traveled each, and every highway 
 (Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more 
 Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy 
 (Let's try this one, uhh, yeah!) 
  
 [Break: Jay-Z (Paul Anka sample)] 
 Gangsta nigga 
 Put my hustle down, tore the game up, nigga 
 Took your high score down, put my name up, nigga 
 Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga 
 I did it my way (and more.. much more than this) 
 That's right, it's a beautiful thing man! 
 (I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way -- Hovi baby! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas 
 Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform 
 Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death 
 Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf 
 Grandma's favorite, she could not understand 
 How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor 
 Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse 
 As a reminder that I make top paper? 
 Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors 
 Nobody gave us shit, we made us 
 The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis 
 Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin 
 We came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon 
 Demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check 
 And while y'all at it, hand over the jet 
 We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick 
 They knew every year I was droppin' new product 
 I was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the Roc up 
 But that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us 
 When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires 
 Je-je-jeah! 
  
 [Chorus: Paul Anka sample] 
 And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Jeah! In my lifetime 
 I caught smaller cases, but I had capital 
 Hypocritical system let me right back at you 
 You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you 
 Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude 
 They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap 
 And they can look good by paintin' him as bad news 
 'Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views 
 Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word 
 So imagine how disturbed I was 
 When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club 
 Let me explain exactly how this shit was 
 This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin 
 But it’s cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over 
 It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein' Hova 
 Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back 
 Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa 
 Helicopter meet me, Teterboro take me over 
 Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' to vultures 
 So the next time that page six approaches us 
 Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way 
  
 [Chorus: Paul Anka sample] 
 And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy[Intro] 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 (I'm kinda lovin' that) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (Yes you can) 
 WELL I'M GONE! 
  
 [Verse] 
 Roc-A-Fella forever, Hov' for life 
 Debut's a classic, first album, four mics 
 Should've got a five, but niggas lack foresight 
 But I don't give a fuck, I ain't do it for the hype 
 I do it for the hustlers for the ghetto for the plight 
 For the struggle for those who bubble white 
 For fly 4X4s, roofless cars, flawless ice 
 For the pain for y'all to know what it's like 
 For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights 
 For every promise made that never saw the light 
 I'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights 
 Four O's, a Glock 40 for the jackers and I'm Spike 
 Or the four-four will suffice 
 A fourteen-year-old to look out for the vice 
 You can sit back and just wait for the flight 
 Your boy'll take off like I've been strippin' all my life 
 That's the type of metaphors I write 
 To let niggas know I was real before the mic 
 Four front rows, had the fur at the fight 
 No PETA on my Peter, left some room for the divas 
 In the suite, we'll meet up if ya wild for the night 
 On a rampage, champagne pours, on the floor 
 For all those who ain't make it here and lost they life 
 Wouldn't forget y'all for any price 
 Not for no hoes, not for no ice 
 Not for no fame nor for bright lights 
 So I'ma end this here, a fly ass kite 
 44 fours, muh'fucka, I'm NICE[Intro: Refrain] 
 That old fashioned word 
 It's a word called love 
 Called looooove 
 Called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove 
  
 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made 
 Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me 
 Y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world 
 Mmm, y'all got me on my shit 
 Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game 
 Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood 
 Come from the same hood you come from 
 We share basically the same stories 
 Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did 
 Since ninety-six, every year 
 Something must be seriously wrong with the world 
 I know y'all ain't hating 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)] 
 (Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating 
 (Some people hate) Uhh, nah, you know what I think? 
 (Some people hate) I think... 
 (I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind 
 Y'all got me on my shit 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public 
 My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it 
 Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas 
 And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters 
 I came from the gutter, my success in this game 
 Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice 
 A payment for brushes with police officers 
 A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in 
 Til I'm deceased in a coffin 
 I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often 
 Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers 
 It's the strengthening of chain among us 
 Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us? 
 Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)] 
 (Some people hate) Yeah 
 (Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh 
 (Some people hate) Yeah! You know what I think? 
 (I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I guess it's just the penalty of leadership 
 I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit 
 Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit 
 'Fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they Ali and shit 
 I roll with the punches so I survive 
 I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side 
 I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise 
 They try to take me out the game but I's alive 
 It's like a old Negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey 
 With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga 
 You bastards know me, the one and only 
 Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely 
 You need Jesus in your life 
 It's either that or y'all gon' make me 
 Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)] 
 (Some people hate) 
 (I know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out) 
 (Some people hate) Jealousy is a weak emotion, man 
 (Some people kill their brothers) 
 C'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what I think? 
 (I think they've lost their minds) You'll be alright though 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit 
 By riding out when niggas had learners' permit 
 We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit 
 I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip 
 Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out 
 Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach 
 Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back 
 Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that 
 Get yourself found drowned where the lake at 
 Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that 
 And then we coming where your wake at 
 Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that 
 Face facts, fake rap cats 
 Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 Some people hate 
 Some people hate 
 Some people kill their brothers 
 I think they've lost their minds 
 And I'm hung up.. ohh..[Beanie Sigel] 
 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy 
 What's the problem shorty? 
  
 [Shorty] 
 Yeah whattup man 
 I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man 
 I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me 
  
 [Beanie Sigel] 
 Alright; hold on - Hova, line one 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it 
 You find a dude in town, you send him a short message 
 Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around 
 But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown 
 I get that butter all night 
 Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite 
 They keep buying hard white 
 And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price 
 FYI, I never been robbed in my life" 
 Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and 
 Let her introduce you 'round town like her man 
 Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent 
 Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up 
 Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit 
 Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them 
 Still there Brooklyn? 
  
 [Shorty] 
 Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Make out a check for eight hundred dollars 
 Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*} 
  
 [Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy 
 [Chris] Whassup Sig? This Chris out the Young Guns dog 
 [Beans] Whattup? 
 [Chris] I'm ready to smash these niggas in the rap game 
 The niggas takin too long with that advance money and shit 
 [Beans] Yeah 
 [Chris] Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills 
 [Beans] Yeah I feel that 
 [Chris] I know you well connected dog 
 Let me holla at somebody real 
 [Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on 
 Bleek, line two 
  
 [Verse 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word 
 I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd 
 You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first 
 If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first 
 You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs 
 Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change 
 The strong move quiet, the weak start riots 
 We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired 
 With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish 
 And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT 
 Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse 
 He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved 
 Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it 
 Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic 
 900-Hustler, you pass it around 
 Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out 
 {*click*, *dial tone*} 
  
 [Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog

 [MDKHN] Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga 
 I got two bricks 
 [Beans] Yo watch your fuckin mouth man 
 [MDKHN] Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga? 
 Been on hold for about two hours nigga 
 [Beans] I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line; 
 Shut the fuck up! Matter of fact, hold on 
 {*click*, *classical type music plays*} 
 [MDKHN] I know this nigga ain't just put.. put me on hold man 
 This bullshit-ass elevator music 
 [Beans] Free, pick up line five 
  
 [Verse 3: Freeway] 
 First things first, watch what you say out your mouth 
 When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers 
 Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch 
 When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers 
 Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out 
 If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya 
 Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state 
 Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!) 
 Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!) 
 You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas 
 I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that 
 Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like 
 Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo 
 Until you up stay away from them dice and whores 
 Three smuts, two straights and a dyke 
 Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure 
 And if it's tight, then he might come back for more 
 Nine and four, everyday back and forth 
 Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler 
 Pass the number til you're stackin balls 
 Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more 
 I take cash or write the check out to F-R 
 Two E's, that'll be two G's 
 And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga 
 {*click*, *dial tone*} 
  
 [Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy dog 
 [MDKHN] Yo whattup young, you put me on hold earlier man what happened

 Get-Indicted-Hotline or somethin motherfucker? 
 [MDKHN] Yo, my bad man, my bad 
 I know I was talkin reckless earlier about them two chickens 
 You get it, you know, two chickens? But listen

 [Intro] 
 Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas 
 Fucked up, right? Ha, I know 
 I know what y'all niggas asking yourself 
 Is he gon' ever fall off? 
 No... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A lot of speculation 
 On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed 
 How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid? 
 Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct 
 Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC? 
 What's the position you hold? 
 Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck but only a single going gold? 
 If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold 
 Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for a O? 
 For the millionth time asking me 
 Questions like Wendy Williams, harassing me 
 Then get upset when I catch feelings 
 Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave 
 While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve 
 Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot? 
 Like you said in Friend or Foe, and if so, what block? 
 What you doin' in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses 
 Latinos in Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico 
 I answer all y'all questions but then y'all got to go 
 Now the question I ask you is how bad you wanna know, BLAOW! 
  
 [Hook] 
 (A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh 
 (A million) How we do, what? 
 (A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh 
 (A million) How we do? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 '98 Primo remix, and ain't nothing different 
 I don't know what the hell, niggas been sniffing 
 Jigga still dipping, chrome on the whips and 
 4 days out the week, find me in the kitchen 
 Still in the game nigga, hooked like glue 
 Papi gave me one pie, but it cook like two 
 I'm a crook like you 
 Cats around my way was buying brand new whips and shit, what could I do? 
 Knowin I'm supposed to style 
 I'm the hustler's poster child, rock lizards and cro-ca-dile 
 Live ironic and what-not 
 Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot 
 Now you see me on them stages 
 Rocks in the air looking like blue lasers, never fugazis 
 Act courageous, I smack 'em with the two aces 
 MAC double one, nigga, I'm troublesome 
 All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum 
 Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them 
 It's the Roc-A-Fella clique, what's fucking with them? 
 Not a damn thang nigga, we doin our damn thing.. BLAOW!!! 
  
 [Hook] 
 (A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh 
 (A million) How we do, come on 
 (A million) 
 (Sounds so beautiful, don't you agree, ladies and gentlemen?) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 HA! Well they call me Jay-Hova 'cause the flow is religious 
 And ever since I was 16 I was holding digits 
 I'm seeing this industry clearer 
 As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror 
 I slow flows y'all to death, so y'all hoes know who's best—Jigga!! 
 The flow be Ay Bendito, for the mamis I hable español poquito 
 Oh Este, I got timing like a segue 
 Now holla back baby 
 Uh-huh-huh, Jay-Z, you motherfucking right 
 In the darkest nights let off my gun for light 
 To guide y'all through, show you how it's done 
 I'm The Question and The Answer like Iverson 
 Jets be private ones, no gate to lift 
 So when I take flight it's from Hangar 6 
 Bang with this, wake up with one in your brain 
 And the cocaine flow's straight numbing your pain 
 This ain't your speed young mayne, run in your lane 
 So I can come through doing a hundred and change 
 I put one in your frame—picture that 
 Who's running the game? Let's get to that 
 I guess we one and the same 
 A million and one... once again 
 Novacane flow, hoe, you ain't know 
 Like a baller in an Impala, Jigga remain low 
 Then I pop up, and tear your block up, and kick off like soccer 
 In a Range Rove, twist hoes like ankles, 'til the next time, nigga 
 I hit y'all with a million more[Produced by Just Blaze]

 [Intro: Jay-Z (over sample)] 
 You gotta let this one breathe, Just 
 Just let it breathe for a second 
 Yup! Hovi's home! 
 The newest addition to The Roc, M.O.P 
 The Blueprint 2 is on its way 
 I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming 
 Let's go get 'em Just! 
  
 [Interlude: Lil' Fame] 
 Time to dump (fiyah!) dump (fiyah!) 
 Dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!!!) 
 (You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing) 
 It's the M.O.P.! 
  
 [Verse 1: Lil Fame] 
 And the zip code is 1-2-3, and motherfucker we coming 
 100 miles and gunning, I'm still running with cats that rob 
 From the era of XL 80's and hatchback Saabs 
 (SAME GAME!) Operation for this industry lockdown 
 We still tote hammers that go blak-ow, run up if you wanna 
 Believe me dawg, these hammers with they owners 
 Fuck your G up, have ya with blue Pampers in a coma 
 And your family now moan, look seventy pounds gone 
 A little fuck, shriveled up with a hospital gown on 
 (WE HOLDING IT DOWN HOMES!) Keep pushing we fell, bastards 
 To get over, we prowl with slippery shell tactics 
 Chippety frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups 
 Lil' nigglet,, what the fuck you recording for, Nick Jr? 
 (THE GAME AIN'T CHANGED) it just got harder 
 Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S dot Carter 
 Brownsville (YEP!), we stomp through this bitch all day 
 Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage 
  
 [Verse 2: Billy Danze] 
 I'm from the G side of thangs, where we ride and bang 
 With a heat that'll flame, that's how we got the name 
 (WARRIORS!) Embedded in ya brains 
 And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came 
 And we're better in the game, you better make it rain 
 (27 a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine 
 Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world 
 And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and earl! 
 A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine 
 So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine 
 I won't sit back and rap like these dumb-ass kids 
 I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids (M.O.P.) 
 The O.G.'s repped and survived around this motherfucker 
 (FIRST FAMILY!) We kept it live around this motherfucker 
 When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay 
 Fo' shizzle my nigga, learned to grip pistols in B.K 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 Turn my music high, high, high, high-er 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Mo' fire, more Rocawear attire 
 Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired 
 Mo' further for the Roc Empire, y'all won't serve us, y'all nervous 
 Know them guns on full service, ready to fire 
 One body, two body, three body, four 
 Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law 
 Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all 
 For my Brownsville neighbors, How About Some Hardcore 
 And it just get worser every time I sign my signature in cursive 
 Just add another million to these verses 
 One million, two million, three million, four 
 And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose 
 My nephew's situated and my mom is straight 
 So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way 
 And you niggas rapping to me, so your drama is fake 
 You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake 
 You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist 
 Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face 
 Appetite for destruction, I am starving today 
 Got a money hungry lawyer that'll eat the case 
 And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste 
 Nigga bite the bullet until you stuffing your face, ha 
 I done forgot more than you ever learned 
 What "U Don't Know" will make yo home a permanent urn, nigga 
  
 [Outro] 
 Do you believe it? 
 You don't know, what you're doing - doing - doing - doing

 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Is he a Blood, is he Crip? 
 Is he that, is he this? 
 Did he do it? Y'know, ehh 
 Look.. 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 If I shoot you, I'm brainless 
 Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin' this 
 I'm waitin' on arraignment, my nigga is the plaintiff 
 Yeah, I know what you thinkin' - fucked up ain't it? 
 I shoulda known better, and I planned to 
 But dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle 
 I sat back and watched it, put the Gats back in the closet 
 They tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage 
 Let niggas take shots at me, no response 
 I just flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz 
 You give a nigga a foot, he'll take you one step beyond 
 He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm 
 You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qur'an 
 Or Old Testament, don't test him then 
 I know what y'all thinkin' dick, pause 
 Your future's my past, I've been here before 
 I know when you're schemin', I feel when you plottin' 
 I got, mental vision, intuition 
 I know where you goin' I read your mind's navigational system 
 Everybody whisperin' - pst pst pst ss perspirin' 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin' 
 Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it? 
 I need to know... geah geah 
 Yeah yeah yeah, yeah... 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin' 
 And I only use his waist to keep my Glock in 
 But when shit goes down you know who's doing the poppin' 
 And if you don't know, guess who's doin' the droppin' 
 S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood 
 Bad move; that's bad news 
 How many times have I got to prove? 
 How many loved ones have you got to lose 
 Before you realize that it's probably true? 
 Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do 
 Shit, I paid my dues, I made the news 
 I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews 
 And the streets say Jigga can't go back home 
 You know when I heard that? When I was back home 
 I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome 
 On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future 
 Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya 
 The answer is simply too dark for the user 
 And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows 
 But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in? 
 'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone 
 From what the block has spoken, my God 
 Everybody stressin', who's his baby's moms? 
 Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin' 
 Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it? 
 I need to know... chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah 
 Chicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah 
 When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin' 
 Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it? 
 I need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh 
 Yeah, yo, yo 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know 
 I lost my Pops when I was eleven, mmm, twelve years old 
 He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin' it's toll 
 But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad! 
 I grew up pushin' snowflake to niggas that was pro-base 
 The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face 
 All I did was smoke joke, think and drink 
 Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game 
 I seen niggas before me, with a chance to write they own script 
 Slip up and change the story 
 I seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory 
 Before reachin' puberty, scared a nigga truthfully 
 I took trips with so much shit in the whip 
 That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF 
 Smell me, nigga? The real me, nigga, minus the rumors 
 Holla if you feel me, nigga 
  
 [Verse 4: Beanie Sigel] 
 The streets is not only watchin' but they talkin' now? 
 Shit, they got me circlin' the block before I'm parkin' now 
 Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin', I'm just cautious now 
 Sub, under the parka, extra cartridge now 
 Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense 
 I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic and Sprint 
 I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors 
 But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in Jumu'ah I know 'stafALLAH 
 Niggas wanna press me, put my back to the wall 
 But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all 
 To know me's to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this 
 Fuck you, I got guns like Neo in Matrix 
 Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like Karo 
 Or soft like Play-Doh, get knocked off like Fredo Corleone 
 They find you with a hole in your dome 
 I roll with niggas that'll follow you and go to your home 
 Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense 
 Catch you while you reachin' 
 Clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin' 
 Apply full court pressure 
 Like .44 Taurus get you out of here, pull pressure 
 To the trigger, bullets fly in three's 
 You forever rest under bullshit, dirt, lies and leaves 
 I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave 
 Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans 
 Niggas wanna despise the team; 'til I play head coach 
 And straight up, divide they team 
 Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things 
 'Til the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..[Intro] 
 Hey nigga I was in Oakland, Oakland like Brooklyn 
 Short! Dawg! Bay area!!! 
 They showed me so much love when I was down there I had to get hyphy on this one 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Uh! Ask my nigga Lebron! 
 We so big we ain't gotta respond 
 When you talkin to a don 
 Please have respect like your talkin to your mom 
 We let the money do the talkin 
 As you see we be talkin rather often (chatterbox!) 
 The ROC Boys in the buildin 
 Another hundred fifty million don't it sound like we yellin?!!! 
 Who the fuck overrated?! 
 If anything they underpaid him 
 Hatin that's only 'gon make him spend the night 
 Out of spite with the chick you've been datin 
 We the best of the best 
 We 'gon be here so the rest could take a rest 
 I gotta get this off my chest 
 No pause none of that shit, get off my dick!!!!

 Hold up, I gotta keep it real 
 It's gonna take seven movies by Will (What up Will?) 
 Seven movies by twenty mil' 
 And you still ten short from what I did with one deal (DAMN!) 
 Don't compare me to nobody 
 I'd rather not be mentioned, I'm offended 
 Unless you talkin Sinatra, James Dean or 
 John Lennon (or) or Jimi Hendrix 
 I'm just a rock star, BEEYITCH!! 
 Keep it real, you know I got y'all BEEYITCH!! 
 We ain't in the same league 
 You could lie to yourself, you can't lie to me (uh-uh, uh-uh!) 
 I don't even know y'all name 
 I'm too big for ya, the rap Lebron James 
 Roc Nation, the new movement 
 And y'all money funny, what the fuck are YOOOU DOING??

 We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon 
 Some how some way 
 We gotta make it up out this life 
 Some way, we gotta make it up out this life 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Whether we dribble out this motherfucker 
 Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker 
 Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker 
 Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker 
 Some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker 
 I don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn 
 Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride 
 Through the sky, I 
 Used to play the hall and fifth floor, me and my boys 
 We all poor getting high, I 
 Seen the worst of the worst, I deserve every blessing 
 I received I'm from the dirt 
 I, planted my seed on unfertile land 
 Myrtle Park, Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand, and 
 Still I grew, some how I knew that the sun'll shine through, and 
 Touch my soul, take hold of my hand 
 Look man, a tree grows in Brooklyn 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Some how some way 
 I gotta make it up out the hood someday 
 Some how some way 
 I gotta make it up out this life, c'mon 
 Some way, I gotta make it up out this hood someday 
  
 [Verse 2: Beanie Sigel] 
 (To Lil' Nell, Sigel Street, I ain't forget you) 
 Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck 
 Nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck 
 Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up 
 Moms smoke, kids can't chase the ice cream truck 
 Girls fighting over rope, the young boys hype things up 
 Niggas fighting over coke, the young boys light things up 
 All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up 
 'member Lil' Eddie draw, man how he light mean up 
 Then they wonder why we light green up 
 Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't, I lean up 
 Ain't the L or the reefer that steam up (that steam up) 
 It's my head and I'm stressed to the point I get a fever 
 Thinking 'bout the block and all the mothers and kids 
 That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed 'em 
 For the rest of their life 
 Fucking wings, fried vegetable rice (gotta be kidding) 
 No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night 
 Our kids eating lunch at night 
 In their beds all bunched in tight 
 No less than three or four (you know how it go) 
 Two by the foot two by the headboard 
 Man I'm getting scared for them (yeah I know) 
 That's how I feel for them 
 And we gotta grip of shorties on the block 
 All they do is smoke weed and drink forties, cop their quarties 
 Enough to get the latest ROC, newest Glock, and old Jordies 
  
 [Chorus: Beanie Sigel] 
 Some how some way 
 We gon' make it up out this hood one day 
 Some how some way 
 We gon' make it up out this life, yeah 
 And some how some way 
 We gon' make it up out the hood one day 
 Some way, we gon' make it up out this life 
  
 [Verse 3: Scarface] 
 Right here another lil' story 'bout this clique I claimed 
 Got another chapter based on how I get that game 
 Just hanging round my neighborhood, bang my street 
 Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep 
 South-side, Sunnyside 
 Is the blocks I run, South Acres, South Park 
 Nigga all got guns 
 Over here we got this code Charlie, get that there 
 We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that now 
 Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps 
 Working inside a smoke house starving to death 
 Serving these niggas flippers, quarter-ounces and jippers 
 Agents snapping your picture 
 Neighbors plotting to get ya 
 Situations is critic 
 I was out here be getting it 
 Living it like a savage 'cause nigga I gotta have it 
 They holding back on a motherfucker, I'm in it for the haul, dog 
 Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all y'all 
 Lord be willing and the creek don't rise 
 I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise 
 (Some how some way) 
 (Some how some way) 
 I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise 
 (Some how some way) 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Some how some way 
 We gotta make it up out the hood some day 
 Some how some way 
 We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon 
 Some how some way 
 We gotta make it up out the hood some day 
 Some way, we gotta make it up out this life 
  
 [Whistling outro][Verse 1] 
 I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in 
 Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in 
 Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin 
 But when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck 
 Ignorant bastard, I'm takin' it back to day one 
 No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun 
 For niggas that think I spend my days in the sun 
 Well here's the shock of your life, the Glock not the mic 
 Homie I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street 
 You still fuckin' up then trust me I still creep 
 Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin' real sweet 
 But reach and I bury niggas sixty feet deep 
 S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs 
 Separate fathers from their daughters, why bother 
 I'm a crook like you, I took like you 
 I disobeyed the law, threw out the book like you 
 How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like who 
 I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me.. 
  
 [Interlude] 
 COME AND GET ME! 
 {*gong sounds*} Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come..

 {*bell rings*} .. come and get me COME AND GET ME 
  
 [Break] 
 Don't know what y'all niggas is 
 Tryin' to do but I don't like it 
 Yeah, straight gangster shit 
 Heyyyy, uh-huh-uh-uhh gangster shit 
 Uhh, straight gangster nigga 
 Roc.. 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, the summer's 'bout to get hot 
 Niggas home from jail and they plottin' 
 Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top 
 The Continental T, got 'em resentin' me 
 God I work hard, please don't envy me 
 I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard 
 I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job 
 All y'all remember is the part about me parkin' the hard 
 What about all them days I was walkin' my dogs 
 Barkin' at broads, but they never hollered back 
 And if they did all they said was, "Where them dollars at?" 
 Imagine, bein' skinny growin' up around brolic cats 
 The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats 
 Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin' back 
 Round the way, niggas called me Bobby Boucher 
 Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay 
 How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away 
 Pull out your gat, car jack me, take my cruise away 
 Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey.. 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga 
 Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga 
 I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga 
 I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga 
 I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME... 
 COME AND GET ME... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good 
 I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood 
 Made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle 
 Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you 
 You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin' witchu 
 'Til I made 'em understand why you do what you do 
 I expected to hear, "Jay, if it wasn't for you.." 
 But instead, all I hear is buzzin' in your crew 
 How y'all schemin', tryin' to get accustomed to my moves 
 So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house 
 But I got pride I'm a nigga first 
 I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first 
 That's how Jigga work 
 The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse 
 And that's the shit that hurts 
 But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here 
 So when y'all feel that the time is right.. 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga 
 Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga 
 I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga 
 I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga 
 I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME... 
 COME AND GET ME... 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Ayo yo, ayo yo 
 It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle 
 I'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna 
 My game change but my mind-frame remains the same 
 I gotta protect what's mine 
 Shit I started from nothin'; zero, zip 
 I made my way hustlin', I don't owe niggas shit 
 I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped 
 Cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped 
 I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip 
 Two in the stash, one come up when I shift 
 I keep one under the chair where I sit 
 I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch 
 Ask Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib 
 He'd find another gun that I hid 
 I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is 
 Everyday like a hundred-and-six... shit... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga 
 Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga 
 I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga 
 I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga 
 I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME... 
 COME AND GET ME... 
  
 I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga 
 Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga 
 I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga 
 I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga 
 I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME... 
 COME AND GET ME... 
  
 [Outro] 
 Motherfuckers![Intro] 
 Uh-huh, yeah hah 
 Never sprung huh? 
 Jigga, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 Never sprung huh? 
 Yeah, peep the repertoire 
 Pa-Pause, feel me on this one 
 Pa-Pause, feel this 
 Never sprung huh? Know my style 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches 
 Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches 
 Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches 
 Can't knock your hustle for real, it's a'ight bitches 
 I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french frames 
 With the french name in the same night 
 Pull you and your tight friend 
 Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in 
 You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R 
 Sexin' in a Lexus car 
 Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all 
 Is like vege-tables in my presence, check it 
 Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard 
 Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs 
 Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred 
 Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em 
 Chicks dream on him, trick cream on 'em 
 Lose it when dudes think it's just music 
 Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em 
 Sexin' around the way girls down to miras 
 I'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's 
 Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw 
 You can love me or hate me, either or 
 I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys 
 Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Pennys 
 Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave 
 Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah 
 Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap 
 Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that 
 You be the same chick when you leave me 
 The bankbook and the credit cards 
 And take everything you came with (it's on) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Yeah, here's somethin' niggas gon' find, not at all funny 
 We takin' all ya bitches, takin' all ya money 
 Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good 
 I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods 
 If the money was the grass and your ass was a tee 
 When I hit it with this club love you comin' with me 
 Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall 
 Kinda tipsy, seein' triple, so I'm fuckin' y'all 
 You remind me of this dream I had the night before 
 I'm kinda hopin' the condom break to have a reason to go raw 
 I'm playin', hit the showers, hit the money spot 
 Where all the models play and big money is dropped 
 Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her 
 She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer 
 I tell you somethin' new, if you don't hop down off that 
 Butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas 
 She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place 
 She said, 'I played my cards right and look, I got the ace' 
 I told her *beatboxes*, 'slow down baby' 
 You dealin' with a baller, who, hold ground crazy, it's on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Beyatch! Fucka 
 Jigga, '9-7 shit, next millennium 
 Recognize, realize, it's on 
 Roc-A-Blok y'all 
 Huh, haha, I'm laughing 
 It's on 
  
 [Answering Machine] 
 "Hi Jay-Z this is (beep). I just wanted to call and apologize 
 For the things I was sayin to you. Y'know, that was kind of, y'know 
 Ridiculous the things I was sayin and I just wanna thank you for 
 Giving "Ta-Ta" the message for me. We could still be cool 
 It was nice meeting you. Bye."[Intro] 
 "In my lifetime" 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up 
 I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta 
 Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow 
 I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change 
 I make the means justify the ends 
 I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz 
 And so I'm rollin' 
 For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'? 
 The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em 
 Uhh, my first felony's approachin' 
 Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen 
 I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control 
 Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know 
 It always crossed my mind 
 That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines 
 Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines 
 I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights 
 Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life, uh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin' cold cash 
 The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr 
 Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin' God? 
 Is this, world my world? Am I the star of stars? 
 Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars 
 All chicks is hollerin' about Jig-ga, the whole city's buzzin' 
 Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago 
 Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah) 
 Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar 
 Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's 
 I'm talkin' big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these (uhh) 
 Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe 
 My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me 
 Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me 
 I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights 
 Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life 
  
 [Chorus] 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, from the beginnin', see, we never seen the endin' 
 Runnin' up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh 
 We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's 
 Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly 
 But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me 
 'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone 
 Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em 
 Bones get disconnected like the phones 
 Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game 
 Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden 
 Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact 
 I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes 
 Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights 
 Now I'm incarcerated for my life 
  
 [Chorus] 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime" 
 What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life? 
 "In my lifetime"[Intro: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek] 
 Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah 
 Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown 
 Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two 
 Cocaine whiter now 
 Operation is sweet 
 Whole game tighter now 
 Moving a brick a week 
 Plus a nigga price is down 
 We them niggas to see 
 Time to start the arising now 
 I don't know what's wrong with Bleek 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek] 
 It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe 
 That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes 
 I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot 
 Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute 
 Jumped out like a star with the flavest car 
 Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors 
 These young niggas think I fell out the loop 
 'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe 
 I hopped out in a suit 
 Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine 
 I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind 
 Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff 
 Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff 
 They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff 
 While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff" 
 Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts 
 As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?" 
  
 [Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Jay-Z)] 
 I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh) 
 Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine 
 Time to change up (what?), no more second in line 
 Nine-eight, these streets is mine 
 (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek] 
 Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart 
 Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart? 
 I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start 
 I should take him in back of the building and blaze him 
 Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe 
 But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide 
 Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five 
 Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye 
 It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us 
 Could see that something was about to go down 
 Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate 
 But it's like he's reading my mind 
 As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind 
 Could he see I had plans on, being the man 
 Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand 
 And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause 
 As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused 
  
 [Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z] 
 I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh) 
 Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine 
 Time to change up (what?), no more second in line 
 Nine-eight, these streets is mine 
 Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh) 
 Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah) 
 Time to change up, no more second in line 
 Nine-eight, these streets is mine 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek] 
 Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters 
 Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops 
 Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers 
 With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us 
 So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond 
 Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers 
 As I stand 
 One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?" 
 I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer 
 But in time's the answer (woo!) 
 Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy 
 Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing 
 Chicks used to ignore me 
 And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40 
 Oh God, don't let him control y'all 
 Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby 
 Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch 
 Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you 
 I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew 
 Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two 
 Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah 
  
 [Chorus: Memphis Bleek, (Jay-Z) & Both] 
 I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line 
 Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine 
 Time to change up (what?), no more second in line 
 Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah) 
 I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh) 
 Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine 
 Time to change up (change up), no more second in line 
 Nine-eight, these streets is mine 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line 
 Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine 
 Time to change up, no more second in line 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Coming of Age two, brand new[Sample] 
 [Its like finding feathers on a housecat] 
  
 (Jay-Z) 
 Lemme take yall somewhere else right now 
  
 [It's like searching for a needle in a haystack] 
  
 Lemme get y'all to zone out wit' me, man 
 (Its a'ight, don't be scared) 
 Take y'all niggas left and center (zone out wit') 
 Bullshit 
  
 [Hook: Sample x2] 
 I hear the people talk (I hear y'all) 
 Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me) 
 Your kind is hard to find 
 Darling, I'm glad you're mine 
  
 (Jay-Z talking during chorus) 
 Y'all niggas should twist up sumthin 
 Real real real tight right here 
 Zone out wit' ya boy 
 If you don't smoke, grab you something to drink 
 Mix it up right 
 If you don't smoke or drink 
 Man, just light up an inscense 
 Fuck it 
 Close ya eyes... Vibe wit' a nigga 
 I want y'all to really hear me 
  
 [Verse] 
 I speak through music, I reach you dudes 
 We can get deeper in the dirt than cleat shoes 
 I refuse to lose 
 I peep you creeps three months in advance 
 I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YA, JUDAS! 
 The man that I am and damn you don't know 
 The harder you go at me the harder I flow 
 Let's do this 
 I'm just a mirror reflectin' your image 
 The minute you switch up your face I pick up the pace 
 There's nothin' to it 
 Pull hammers from my waist 
 We can clap at this amateur pace 
 If that's what's crackin' 
 Or we can play this on "All Madden" 
 Can you even fathom not havin' a fear in the world 
 I'm cool in my afterlife 
 If I'm readin' these chapters right 
 Please what have you, I breeze through Matthews 
 Bleed if I have to, you cowards die a thousand deaths 
 Fake fucks face-down on your housing steps 
 Are y'all even gettin' this message? 
 I ain't bein' aggressive 
 But if you testin' my life then, shit, I gotta answer 
 Gotta cut off the cancer, young'n, pull your pants up 
 You gettin' too big for ya britches 
 You fuckin' wit' a dude that did it wit' digits 
 Breathing's a privilege 
 Don't you know when you're defeated? 
 Won't you though? Throw in the towel 
 I'm better with vowels 
 I'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible 
 In my own mind now that my soul's aligned 
 I didn't know before now my role's defined: 
 Take hold and control what's mine 
 Come and get me! 
 Come and take my life, you comin' wit me 
 Come and try to take me for granted 
 I'll take you off this planet 
 Dammit, man this is the gift from God 
 This ain't happenstance 
 And your arms are too short to box 
 Plus we knuckle up unorthodox 
 You can't take me off my grind, get off my cock 
 Whatchu thought? It's the Roc 
  
 [Sample x3] 
 I hear the... 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Back in the mix of the scuffle 
 Since '86 I was sick with the hustle (Woo!) 
 Get a couple of chicks to touch you (Woo!) 
 Feather-weight fucker dont ever hate on the brothers 
  
 Heh-heh 
 Thought I was playin' but you niggas'll stop now 
 I ain't gotta sell another record in my life 
 The Blueprint 2, baby! (Mm-hmm) 
 See y'all in November (Oh shit!) 
  
 [Sample Hook]1x 
 I hear the people talk (C'mon) 
 Yes sir and when you walk (C'mon) 
 Your kind is hard to find 
 Darling, I'm 
 Darling, I'm 
 Darling, I'm[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD 
 If you like me you reading the credits right now 
 If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter 
 I want you to put all your windows down 
 Zone out, buckle up, let's go 
  
 [Verse: Jay-Z] 
 Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over 
 The new millennium is upon us, the album is here 
 Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear 
 Rappers with no relation: 
 There's "Seven Degrees of Separation" and I'm Kevin Bacon 
 This is the murderer's version 
 Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person 
 Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban 
 Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him 
 Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working 
 Now watch how quickly I drop 50 
 I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me 
 Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me 
 Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me 
 I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey 
 Do you believe? It's Hova the God 
  
 [Outro: Pain In Da Ass] 
 Makes you think about the people in your life 
 Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here 
 He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about? 
 If you don't go through as a man's a man" 
 He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time 
 That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are" 
 How many years you been around this thing of ours? 
 Commission, 125 years 
 What's it about? 
 It's about rules, parameters 
 You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down 
 You don't betray who you are, what you are 
 You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory 
 They don't roar, they don't rap 
 You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them 
 You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble 
 Okay so you humble me now, what you got? 
 You got a war, you got global war 
 You got a worldwide crime syndicate now 
 There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings 
 There's no feelings for this game 
 So.. five ten years from now 
 You're gonna wish there was American Commission 
 Five ten years from now... 
 They're gonna miss Jay-Z 
 OKAY, I'M RELOADED![Intro: Dr. Dre & Jay-Z] 
 Yeah! 
 Uh uhh uh-uhh, boom boom boom 
 D-R-E! 
 Say with me niggas, boom boom 
 And Jay-Z 
 Boom boom boom boom 
 What the fuck? 
 Boom boom boom boom 
 Watch me! 
 Jigga Man, ya heard? Boom boom boom 
 Brooklyn, ya heard? Boom boom boom 
 Compton! 
 Gotti Gotti ya heard? Yo 
 C'mon! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You gotta, pop that styles, rock that watch dial 
 See that Benz? Cop that now 
 Drop that top down, they gon' kill us anyway 
 Them cops Uptown hit Homes with forty-one rounds 
 Live yo' life, get yo' ice 
 She been with you since day one nigga, trick on your wife 
 Spend that dough, when in doubt, take that trip 
 She ain't living for the moment homie, shake that bitch 
 He that cool, he can't take you nowhere? Leave that fool 
 Be that rude if he that cool 
 Save for what? Ball 'til your days is up 
 This place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such 
 How they make it where you afraid to fuck 
 They gave us drugs then turned around and investigated us 
 Life is short, then you on life support 
 So in between it all, I'ma say I seen it all, watch me 
  
 [Chorus: Dr. Dre & (Jay-Z)] 
 Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh) 
 And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (uhh, watch me) 
 At any, chance you hit (that's right), we live for the moment 
 (Yo watch, watch) Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars 
 (Watch me!) You see me around some cheese 
 (Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them G's 
 (Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed 
 (Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me 
 (Watch me!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Watch me turn something out of nothing, turn Platinum from Gold 
 Watch me light the Cohiba off the Viking stove 
 I take an empty bank account, fill it with Os 
 I take an empty building then I fill it with hoes 
 Watch me, cop that Coupe, shine for the ladies 
 Have 'em saying, "Damn I never seen a watch that blue" 
 And while they still mesmerized I pop that cooch 
 Shit, law enforcement couldn't stop that dude 
 Guess who? Fresh off of Vol. 2 
 Back at you, peep the numbers my album do 
 They call me Champagne Hova, wake up with a hangover 
 When y'all think the game's over, do the same thing over 
 Still with the same soldiers 
 Still getting brain and it's plain ain't a thing gon' change Hova 
 Hop out the truck, hand on my cock and nuts 
 Who got the bank? I'm stocking it up (watch me) 
  
 [Chorus: Dr. Dre & (Jay-Z)] 
 Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh) 
 And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (watch me) 
 At any chance you hit, we live for the moment 
 Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars 
 (Watch me!) You see me around some cheese 
 (Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them G's 
 (Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed 
 (Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me 
 (Watch me!) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, the watch too rocky, need shades 
 Continental sitting on blades, spinning like waves 
 Gun too Brock-y, behave 
 Big shot, plus I'm feeling like Rocky these days 
 Ice don't melt, I could ski through a heatwave 
 Nights won't help you see Jay, it'll be day 
 My shit too bright, I rip through mics 
 Plus I push more powder than Crystal Light 
 Chick mad, said I hold my pistol too tight 
 Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life 
 I buy out the bar, spit Cris' through the mic 
 See Jigga in the 6 and all the shit you like 
 See Jigga giving dick to every bitch you like 
 I told her, "It's Jay-Day and Hit-You-Night" 
 You wanna, see me again you gotta get two dykes 
 I got rules I can't hit you twice, you heard me? 
 Watch me! 
  
 [Chorus: Dr. Dre & (Jay-Z)] 
 Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh) 
 And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (that's right) 
 At any chance you hit, we live for the moment 
 Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars 
 (Watch me!) You see me around some cheese 
 (Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them G's 
 (Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed 
 (Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me 
 (Watch me!) 
 (Watch me!) You see me around some cheese 
 (Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them G's 
 (Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed 
 (Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me 
 (Watch me! Watch me!)

 (Watch me!)[Intro: Jay Z] 
 Yeah, Renegade is back 
 Em, the beat is sick! 
 It's Young, Freeway, 8 Miles, let's go! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs 
 But I can rewind the calendar back 
 Back when it was now or nothin' 
 People said I would amount to nothin' 
 That I had talent for nothin' 
 Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman 
 I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had comin'." 
 Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin' 
 Wanting somethin', claiming that they done somethin' for him 
 Got their Jay Z pom poms and their Hov uniform 
 Claiming they been runnin' 
 And tellin' everybody, like Martin Lawrence 
 'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was 
 Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up 
 You what? Where was you before I blew this up? 
 I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us 
 I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up 
 Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z + Freeway] 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 
  
 [Verse 2: Freeway] 
 6 miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six 
 Trans might shift while the engine run 
 Anyone tell your honor: "Give me one more chance." 
 And them smokers screaming, "One more gram!" 
 So I'ma bring 'em one 
 Only son to my pop, stick close to my mama 
 Keep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son 
 My son growin' and he learnin' a lot 
 That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop 
 Brain on your, um–brella, a nigga, tell 'em niggas 
 That's like the Biblical scripture 
 Look back, turn to salt, like the sinners 
 Most of your heartless and self-centered 
 Like Meshach and Mesha 
 Set up your brother ‘cause you jealous, nigga 
 The heat back, like you never left 
 I ever rep, cops watch every step 
 Six miles and runnin', dodgin' every trap 
 The rap gingerbread man 
 Cherish every precious breath, state P the second gat 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z + Freeway] 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Back when nobody would find he had talent 
 Nobody would sign me 
 Nobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy blindly 
 But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt 
 To come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me 
 When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me 
 That's why I'm taking all the industry's money 
 Revenge is sweet honey, we run this 
 Young is the illest, Free is the future 
 Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see y'all 8 miles, nigga 
  
 [Hook: Jay Z + Freeway] 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 
 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin' 
 And my eighth album comin' 
 Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free! 
 6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin' 
 And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Swear to God I just touched down 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (LaToiya Williams)] 
 All around the world.. (same song) 
 Killer Cali, nigga (same song) 
 A-T-L (same song) 
 Real-adelphia.. dude it's all around the world 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 London, England, South of France 
 And all points between they know about your man 
 Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan 
 I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am 
 Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew 
 Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw 
 Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri 
 Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like "Oui" 
 Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak 
 And handlin' a model, standin' about five-eight 
 Five-nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that 
 Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time 
 Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali 
 Brunchin' at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy 
 Then it's back home, nigga, back to the zone 
 Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (LaToiya Williams)] 
 All around the world.. (same song) 
 Brooklyn bombers (same song) 
 Detroit players (same song) 
 Chi-Town.. all around the world 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Said it's all love, Shore Club, M-I-A 
 Party at bungalow eight, when I stay 
 Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's 
 A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante 
 Come and Talk to Me, mami in the Yves Saint 
 Laurent, I hope, she ain't too young 
 Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her 
 I'm just tryin' to show her how a baller and a roller 
 Sleep one place, tell the pilot to keep the engine 
 Runnin' then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard 
 St. Bart's this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas 
 Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas 
 Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list 
 Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl 
 Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy 
 A ticket and your favourite CD - sweet Sade 
  
 [Break: LaToiya Williams] 
 Sade, Sade, don't you know I love you sweet Sade, Sade 
 All around the world 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at 
 Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap 
 It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act 
 Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good 
 Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed 
 Slackin' on they mackin', rest haven for hoes 
 Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks 
 Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie I know 
 Shit, it ain't about your city or borough 
 It's 'bout if you really as thorough 
 And if you are, holla at your boy 
 I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you 
 Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar 
 I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death 
 I promise I'm in St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's 
 One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet? 
 Then we party like the sun don't set 
  
 [Outro: LaToiya Williams] 
 We gon' take you all around the world.. it's the same song (same song) 
 Everywhere (same song) 
 It's the same song (same song) 
 We gon' take you all around the world.. same song (same song) 
 Same song (same song) 
 Same song (same song) 
 All around the world..

 [Intro] 
 This song here is dedicated to Danny Dan, may he rest in peace 
 Who at his funeral left us with the words that 
 He did it his way, so I have no other choice but to do it my way 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 While niggas are shootin' stupid, I'm carefully plottin' 
 Ways to make it rotten, well-planned hits until you're long forgotten 
 Y'all niggas that utilize my style don't hurt me 
 Cause on the low half of these rappin' ass niggas wanna work for me 
 Now picture me standin' on somebody block tryin' to rock 
 I drop bombs and niggas see me with that dough by eight o'clock 
 My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards 
 While you're starin' on my dick nigga, gimme yours 
 I don't hassle with capsules, cause that'll make the grass grow 
 And get a project nigga paid up the asshole 
 If I'mma risk a frisk, gettin' my wrists wrapped up in steel 
 I'm out here trying to make a mill', my shit is real for real 
 While others worship guns I worship tons of money 
 Tons of fun, laughin' at shit that ain't even funny 
 So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow 
 80% of these niggas with deals 
 Can't see me with the dough, uh 
  
 [Hook] 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 More ice than winter '94 
 I toured the 50 states with a trunk of raw 
 Recruitin', I'm hittin' shorties with consignment but don't play me 
 Oh, you gon' pay me, y'all niggas ain't crazy 
 I'm laid back in the five thousand Italian leather seat recliner 
 Under some vagina, discussin' the finer, things 
 My crib is mean, watchin' a hundred inch screen 
 Lettin' the shorties slide by once in a while and let 'em dream 
 They think I've mastered the game, cause dames scream my name 
 With passion, I tell 'em stop flashin' and start stashin' 
 And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel 
 Is from a sauna, lettin' bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna 
 And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in 
 Pounds of herbs and profit if niggas wanna smoke dope 
 But keep your nuts, cause this is a man's game 
 And we'll all pop champagne till it's a damn shame 
  
 [Hook] 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm shooting to Vegas, gambling green-o at the casino 
 Schoolin' the dice like Vinny Barberino 
 Welcome back, the '95 version of the mack 
 As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act 
 Cause like that, nigga, never twist the cap of malt liquor 
 Only pop and droppin' Cristal's down my throat, take a swigga 
 My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile 
 You're rollin' with a pro with, money to blow child 
 You need to feel how sweet the skills be 
 To come and slide down Sugar Hill with me 
 The high roller, rolled up on your dice game 
 Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all 
 I never slept, cause sleeping keeps you deep in debt 
 On the block you lucky if you see my silhouette 
 I'm ghost, envied by most 
 So I keep a crew of crazy tenants that's sling toast, fucker 
  
 [Hook] 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough 
 I need a whole lot of dough 
 In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash 
 I need a whole lot of cash 
  
 [Outro] 
 Haha, f'real, Jay-Z lives 
 Ski, Roc-a-Blok Productions, uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Dame Dash, ha-ha, Roc-a-fella Records, uh huh 
 Everybody from Brooklyn 
 Sauce Money, Big Sarge, B High 
 DJ Clark Kent, everybody Uptown 
 Best Out, my V-A clique running thick 
 D'Shawn definitely in the house 
 Roughness y'all, this how we do{*Gunshots*} 
 {*Woman screamin' in pain*.. cops yellin' "Go! Go! Go! Go!"} 
 {*Police sirens*} 
  
 [Chorus: Alana Davis sample] 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk 
 Kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) "You goin' with us" 
 I held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss 
 Not only money but all the emotions goin' through us 
 Why we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him 
 Look in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary), hopin' God forgave him 
 Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement 
 We live dangerous, often findin' ourself in the eyes of strangers 
 (Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich 
 As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit 
 Back to live action, I'm packin', I'm still in the mix 
 Like new hits, I think I'm goin' over your head a lil' bit 
 But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town 
 Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now 
 Jay-motherfuckin'-Z; and with that said 
 Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and I ahh 
  
 [Chorus: Alana Davis sample] 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 My infatuation with autos led to autos gettin' sprayed 
 Houses gettin' broken in, quarters gettin' trayed 
 Bricks gettin' chopped, mom's pots gettin' used 
 One thrown in that water, try the soda if there's two (bring it back) 
 Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seats, roof gone 
 Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon 
 I gotta do Shawn, 'cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm 
 I was gettin' my loot on, nigga I'm too strong 
 Eat 'til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth 
 The twin brother of Rich Porter, separated at birth 
 I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler 
 Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto 
 See the place that corrupted us 
 Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us 
 Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit 
 Plus ain't nobody lovin' us; and with that said 
 Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and I ahh 
  
 [Chorus: Alana Davis sample] 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
 Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh 
 I ahh, think there's been a.. 
 I.. I think there's been a.. 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 See my life is like a see-saw 
 And until I move this weight it's gon' keep me to the floor 
 Travel with me through my deep thoughts 
 Y'all can't learn Jigga by the shit y'all be readin' in The Source 
 It's deeper of course 
 Follow the life of this reckless minor 
 At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver 
 Playin', cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us 
 Flippin' a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers!) 
 Buck-thirty on the turns 
 Reckless abandon, when I'm standin' on this pedal 
 Hand on my metal, mind is on this time they tryin' to give me 
 Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or 
 Somebody to tell me that they felt me 
 I tried to play the hand you dealt me 
 But you gave me five funnies an' shit 
 I was hungry I needed menage money 
 Nothin' less than a 520; and with that said 
 Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is {*gunshot*} 
  
 [Outro: Alana Davis sample] 
 {Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh}[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Sup ma? You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin'? 
 It's good, it's love, it's all love 
 We got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare 
 We gon' really get to know one another 
 All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right 
 Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Relax yourself, let your conscience be free 
 You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C 
 Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be 
 But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game 
 Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot 
 The topic of discussion in every nail shop 
 It's a secret society, all we ask is trust 
 And within a week, watch your arm freeze up 
 Brassiere get right, A to a D cup 
 Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up 
 Ears get iced, gear get spiced 
 From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life 
 Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell 
 Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel 
 Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well 
 Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself 
  
 [Chorus: Rell & Jay-Z] 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family 
  
 [Verse 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice 
 Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya 
 How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures 
 How to play it cool when police come to pinch us 
 Relax mami, let the Belvy flow 
 Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow 
 I could teach you how to roll, teach you 'bout fly kicks 
 Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit 
 When the beeper goes off, please don't reach 
 Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek 
 Get your mind right baby, goin' through mine crazy 
 When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy 
 Track my last call, contact my broad 
 With a bitch or two had physical contact in the mall 
 You got issues {*inhales*} problems you need to iron out 
 I will, holla, for now you on time out 
  
 [Chorus: Rell, Jay-Z & Snoop Dogg] 
 You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C 
 C'mon little mama, c'mon 
 You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 C'mon little mama, c'mon 
 I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 C'mon baby girl, c'mon 
 And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 C'mon little mama, c'mon 
  
 [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg] 
 P-I-M-P-ology 
 I play you and you pay me 
 Believe me when I tell you girl I know you a freak 
 For fuckin' with me, that ain't all you can be 
 Just put your mind to it you can go real far 
 I know times gettin' hard on the boulevard 
 They say, pimpin' is dead; man, pimpin' ain't dead 
 These hoes just scared and they blind tryin' and dyin' to be lead 
 But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em 
 Get they mind right and feed 'em 
 Now I don't need 'em (uh uh), but I can do that there 
 Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair 
 So I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place 
 Got yo' bitch all on my line and now she up in my face 
 Is this yo' bitch is that yo' bitch 'cause if she's not she mine 
 She fallin fo' a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line 
  
 [Bridge: Snoop Dogg] 
 Get out my limelight bitch and get your mind right 
 C'mon little mama, c'mon 
 Get your mind right bitch, get your mind right 
 C'mon baby girl, c'mon, c'mon 
  
 [Chorus: Rell & Jay-Z] 
 You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C 
 Get your mind right mami, get your mind right 
 You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me 
 Get your mind right ma, get your mind right

 [Verse 3: Beanie Sigel] 
 R (dot) O (dot) C (dot) stop 
 From Tower to ma and pop, I move out stop 
 Shower your mom block, move out with Glocks 
 Raw to the cook, look, move out them blocks 
 Take it to the bucks who be grindin' it up 
 Usually take it to the dubs so they diamond it up 
 Competition, linin' 'em up 
 Forty-five ACP, let me squeeze lime 'em up 
 You want, drama what, well silence it up 
 Since a young buck, violent as fuck 
 Wasn't me dog, the high will do it 
 I used to wild off embalmin' fluid, I sent niggas to the trauma unit 
 Forty-five or the nine'll do it 
 I fuck around and have your moms go through it - I'm a beast! 
 Shit, niggas always wanna ye shit, then they wanna cease shit 
 When they motherfuckin' peeps hit 
 But I don't cease nothin', I decease som'un 
 I fuck around and have you sleepin' underneath som'un 
 Jigga Man what, Sigel Sigel y'all 
 Memph Bleek uh, Amil-lion, right 
  
 [Verse 4: Amil] 
 Yo, A to the M-I, feminist 
 Holding the semi, leave niggas faced with a dilemma 
 Am I, gon' run or stay, can I 
 Get away no you can't can't I surrender? 
 And I, lazy bop, Mercedes hot 
 In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all 
 Memph Bleek what, Amil-lion, uhh[Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Right, right 
 Yo, peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip 
 Jumped out like "YO! Who the fuck you with?" 
 Flash the jewels 'cause that's the rule 
 Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes 
 Face natural - can I get at you? 
 Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo 
 With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun 
 I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon 
 I said I never seen a face like yours before 
 And I been around some cute whores before 
 That either me or my boys tore it up before 
 So I'm hoping you different, let you push the 6 and 
 Give you a different life and baby if it's right 
 Jump on it in the morning and ride it 'til the night 
 Want to buy you real jewelry when it hits the light 
 Bitches'll momentarily lose they sight 
 She said 
  
 [Chorus: Lil Kim] 
 I know what boys like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what boys like, boys like 
 I know what boys like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what boys like, boys like me 
  
 [Verse 2: Lil' Kim] 
 You want a cutie with a booty like POW! 
 Deeper than a MILE! Earrings shine like TADOW! 
 But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things 
 Only real bitches live like queens - Get it? 
 Safety deposit in the walk-in closet 
 Marble faucets and matching Rolls Royces 
 In the driveway from Monday to Friday 
 I be the richest, shitting on these bitches 
 While chickens cluck giving up the butt 
 I plays the cut with the Daddy Warbucks 
 You can call me a slut, who gives a fuck 
 That's fine nigga shit, I'm good with mine 
 I can tell by your shoes you know what I want 
 Fuck a pre-nup give me half up front 
 My sex be the best so we split these costs 
 You can stop saying mine 
 And start saying ours 
  
 [Chorus: Puff Daddy & Lil' Kim] 
 I know what girls like, I'm a flyyyy girl 
 I know what they want 
 They want to sex me 
 They think I'm sexy 
 I know what girls like, girls like me 
 I know what boys like 
 I know what they want 
 They want to sex me 
 They think I'm sexy 
 I know what boys like, boys like me 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze 
 Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King 
 The price was like eight digits a long way, shit 
 Got the beachfront view, V1 too 
 Cop you one, cop me one too 
 On the place, jet ski's park by the lake 
 No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make 
 Invite your friends over 
 Let 'em make their way through the Benzes and the Rovers 
 Before they reach the door 
 Vacate, away a week or more 
 First class to and fro, freaking off 
 Got to have things locked, champagne popped 
 Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop 
 Cop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot 
 Can't complain, we balling, true or not ma? 
  
 [Chorus: Puff Daddy & Lil' Kim] 
 I know what girls like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what girls like, girls like 
 I know what girls like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what girls like, girls like me 
 I know what boys like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what boys like, boys like 
 I know what boys like 
 I know what they want 
 I know what boys like, boys like me[Intro: Jay-Z, Kid Capri & Both] 
 Yeah, uh-huh, watch this y'all 
 Uhh, watch this y'all 
 C'mon, Jigga, watch this y'all 
 C'mon, Roc-A-Fella y'all.. 
 Huh! Watch this y'all 
 It's  Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on! 
 It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh! 
 'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah 
 I'm really like that 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist 
 Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain 
 And had to numb it with base 
 Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase 
 Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste 
 Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place 
 Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past 
 I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin' 
 Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women 
 If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin' 
 My motto is, simply "I will not lose!" 
 Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used 
 With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it? 
 I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood 
 If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood 
 I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still 
 Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature 
 If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors 
 Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six 
 Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats 
 This is, not a game this is not why I came 
 May these words find a spot on your brain and burn 
 Then I recycle my life, I shall return 
  
 [Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)] 
 How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 How right is your dough?  ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 How white is your blow?  ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 Only, write what you know  ('Cause I'm like that) 
 How tight is your flow? (Just like that yo) 
 How right is your dough? (Just like that, huh) 
 How white is your blow? (Uh huh, 'cause I'm like that) 
 Only, write what you know (Watch this, yeah, watch this yo) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin' the pump 
 Spittin' a couple of curse words, and hittin' you chump 
 Shit, I get digits in lumps 
 I'm a motherfuckin' problem, is this what you want? 
 Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper 
 I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper 
 'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas 
 Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!) 
 Fuck hot, my records got the fever 
 Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up 
 I creep up when the beef heats up 
 Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off 
 Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off 
 You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all 
 I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX 
 But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats 
 Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that 
 E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that? 
 Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that 
 Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha) 
 Rappers y'all, runnin' around like I won't gun ya down 
 Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around 
 Lord, accept this offerin' here's somethin' for your crown (please) 
 I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won 
  
 [Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)] 
 How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 How right is your dough? (Just like that yo) 
 How white is your blow? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 Only, write what you know (I'm just like that yo) 
 How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 How right is your dough? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 How white is your blow? ('Cause I'm like that yo) 
 Only, write what you know (Just like that yo) 
 How tight is your flow? 
 How right is your dough?

 [Verse 1] 
 Whose house? Hov, no doubt 
 'Bout the only rapper still getting money in the drought 
 I moves out, in the global, I'm a mogul 
 Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile 
 Fuck talking 'bout the recession, the shit's depressing 
 I rock with Obama but I ain't no politician 
 And I chill with the thugs and the gangsters too 
 I ain't a blood but I'm warring with the boys in blue 
 Crooked officer, crooked officer! 
 Why you wanna see me in a coffin, sir? 
 Is it against the law, the way I'm flossin', sir? 
 Benzes, Rolls Royces, and Porsches, ugh! 
 Haters like, "Hov, why you still talkin money shit?"

 [Verse 2] 
 That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar 
 Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fucking rockstar 
 To-day is gonna be the day 
 That I'm gonna throw it back to you! 
 I'm living life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, partna 
 Coming down in Mercedes, peeling off on the boppers 
 Worldwide show, I'm coming down in a chopper 
 Hundred eighty thou', screamin "Hov!" with the Roc up 
 It's too easy! 
 I got ladies on shoulders, showing me they chi-chis 
 I met honey at the show last year 
 And now I'm acting brand new like a world premiere (world premiere!) 
 Yeah, I know life ain't fair 
 But chill, baby girl, my girl is here 
 I got models in the mosh pit 
 Dancing off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!

 [Verse 3] 
 You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit 
 You ain't gotta jock me, homie; jock my chick 
 Jock her Zanottis; she body you with the fit 
 No, that's not Pilates; her body's just thick 
 You ain't gotta jock her, nigga; jock my clique 
 Jock the dope boys 'cause we all tossed bricks 
 Federales jock me while I'm crossing the bridge 
 Click, click! Take a portrait of this 
 I ain't no pretty boy; I got a gorgeous wrist 
 Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty... sick 
 I'm so ghetto chic 
 I'm where the hood and high fashion meet 
 Ooh-wee, I'm like the camouflauge Louis 
 How you niggas want it? The tux or the toolie? 
 Haters, I ain't mad at you 
 If I wasn't me I'd probably jock me too! (too!)

 Uhh... 
 Uhh, yeah 
 Won't stop niggas 
 "Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game" 
 Jigga! Feel me! 
 Pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke" 
 Uhh, Roc-A-Fella 
 Geyeah 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 We treat this rap shit just like, handlin' weight 
 What they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take 
 Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake 
 Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake 
 When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state 
 Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate 
 But first we scope shit, advertise in every area 
 Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit 
 Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio 
 Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show 
 Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe 
 Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five 
 Ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin' clientele 
 So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale 
 But when demand grows it's time to expand yo 
 You don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho' 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke" 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke" 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke" 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Ge-ge-geyeah 
 I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk 
 Got your whole block now, pumpin' my work 
 My CD's is like keys for you Willie's who 
 Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's 
 And my singles like gems, you know the treys 
 Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay 
 You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks 
 'Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit 
 Never pitchin' for a label, Jigga's the hook-up 
 You know my shit is fishscale, y'all niggas is cook up 
 Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota 
 They know my shit stretch without the bakin' soda 
 Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key 
 Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories 
 Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked 
 Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa 
  
 [Chorus] 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke" 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke" 
 "Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" 
 "See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"

 [Intro] 
 The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was just talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end 
 It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must conclude 
 Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand as a monument to the one that came before 
 That came before 
 That came before 
 That came before 
 That came before...[Intro: Jay-Z & Beyoncé] 
 It ain't for everybody! (Uhh) 
 Welcome to Hollywood, baby (take a picture) 
 Uh-huh, you coming with? (Let's not even talk about it) 
 Let's do it (let's go) uh-huh 
  
 [Pre-Hook: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 I see your jealousy as you watching (I see you watching me, baby) 
 You watching (it's all good) 
 It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (I love it) 
 You watching (uh-huh, come on) 
 I see your face (I see your face) 
 You wanna touch it (you wanna touch it) 
 Come to my place (come to the crib) 
 And let's discuss it (let's chop it up) 
 Tonight you'll be, a superstar 
 Tonight you gonna be a superstar, baby 
 Come let me sign you up (let's get into it) 
  
 [Hook: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (action!) 
 You need that (Hollywood!) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (satisfaction!) 
 You need that (Hollywood) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise 
 I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes 
 My God, I know how Ozzie Oz 
 Once had felt when he was as high as I have got 
 I have got to make this stop 
 People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart 
 It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers 
 When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction 
 Locomotion like when the train departs 
 Stranger, things have happened 
 Rapping, stacking, platinum plaquin' 
 Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan 
 Going back to Brooklyn to escape the madness 
 When your friends is, Chris and Gwyneth 
 When your girl is more famous than you then it's 
 Time to get all your windows tinted 
 Keep your eyes squinted, it's gon' flash any minute 
 The music biz is like musical chairs 
 It's about where you standing when the music stop spinning 
  
 [Hook: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (action!) 
 You need that (Hollywood!) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (satisfaction!) 
 You need that (Hollywood) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
  
 [Post-Hook: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 You got to get it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh) 
 Do you want it? (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh) 
 But you don't need it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh) 
 What do you do? Oh oh oh oh 
 Now that you got what you want 
 What do you do? Oh oh oh, hey 
 Oh you want more? 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Hey mister, pay six-a, a list-a, you're in the mist of 
 The ride of your life but you gotta keep them hits up 
 Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up 
 Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating, ain't it? 
 Try not to get jaded, Hollywood's been good to ya 
 Startin' feel like buzz to ya, don't lie 
 Gon' fly, you addicted to the lights 
 Without the fame how you gon' survive 
 It's like living on heroin, you so high 
  
 [Bridge: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 And everybody warning you about it (I tried to told you) 
 And once you taste, you can't live without it (it's addictive) 
 Not cause you choose to not live without it 
 You sure you want this, baby? 
 It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (it's a part of you) 
 And everybody warning you about it 
 I see you changed, I see you blinded 
 And once you taste you can't live 
  
 [Hook: Beyoncé & Jay-Z] 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (action!) 
 You need that (Hollywood!) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
 Ooh it's the lights 
 You blinded by the (satisfaction!) 
 You need that (Hollywood) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Wanna be seen, male groupies 
 Now you've become what you once despised 
 James Dean, John Belushi 
 Blow your whole life tryna live in the lights 
 Heroins following Marilyn 
 Hoppin' over the edge just like Janis Joplin 
 River Phoenix, Jimi Hendrix 
 Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by 
 Hollywood, thank God for Hollywood 
 Hollywood, sure you want this baby? 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Hollywood 
 It's the most addicted drug in the world 
 Want the fame? You want the lights? 
 Hahaha[Produced by DJ Premier] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Uh-huh uh, the saga continues... 
 Motion picture shit 
  
 [Verse] 
 I'm done talking 
 Ran up in the spot gun smoking 
 Shot it in the air, one woke him 
 Son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in! 
 Thinking to himself what done provoked him 
 His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan 
 I swear I saw a light bulb when 
 He finally realized who was the culprit 
 I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when 
 I told you don't ever ever come around here no more 
 Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down 
 This time you're really going to listen to Jay now 
 I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize 
 I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be 
 Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys 
 And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me 
 But I was like "Nah", Homes had to know he was wrong 
 And if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song 
 Plus you promised 
 And that's really no fun 
 And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns 
 And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms 
 Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon 
 But my mind's like a flower in bloom 
 Peep how my eyes just scour the room 
 I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out 
 You think you the first nigga I played out, in a two-hotel town? 
 Come on now, I peeped your Lexus as you 
 Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town 
 Money well invested, rudely interrupted 
 Jamaican accent (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?) 
 A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with? 
 I'm done talking, back up and clap him, one in the abdomen 
 Do me a favor dude, get two ice cubes I pass them 
 Take that ice up, for the nicest MC 
 And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable 
 Friend or foe BIOTCH![Intro] 
 Gimme that beat, fool, it’s a full-time jack move 
 Don’t worry, 'Schino, I'll give it back soon 
 Just having a little fun 
 Wassup, my nigga? 
 S. Dot, the Collection 
 Black Album coming soon 
 Just gonna vent a little bit 
 Have a little fun with it 
 Yes, yes 
  
 [Verse] 
 Ain't nobody dumpin' on Hov, you ain’t in sanitation 
 Or sanitarium, what are you, crazy? Jay-Z'll bury 'em 
 I'll get you drug out the club, they'll have to carry 'em 
 Go ahead, bug out, I'll Raid, nigga, scurry 
 Worry, I'm, not, the Mike Jordan of the mic, recording 
 It's Hovi, baby, you Kobe, maybe; Tracy McGrady 
 Matter-fact, you a Harold Miner 
 J.R. Rider, washed up on marijuana 
 Even worse, you a Pervis Ellis 
 You worthless, fella; you ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley 
 I ain’t talkin' to nobody in particular 
 My flow's just vehicular homicide when I’m kickin' up DUST! 
 Anybody in my path is a car crash waiting to happen 
 Nigga, WHAT! 
 I got my foot on the throat on the pulse of this rap game 
 And I ain’t letting up, YUP! 
 Who’s the nicest? Life or lifeless on these mic devices 
 And I don't write this, I just mic this, I will it to happen 
 One-take Hov, I’m real at this rapping 
 My new name is Just the Facts 
 While the rest of y'all just adjust the facts 
 Put words together, just to match 
 I say what I feel, y’all adjust to that 
 I do the opposite of y’all so I just attract 
 The realer audience usually unjustly Black 
 Know my flow and the shit they go through just match 
 Like the sound of my voice and a choice Just track 
 I just tackle the subject, the flak from the public is nothing 
 I know real niggas happen to love it 
 If you don’t like it, then look in the mirror 
 Most likely you ain’t live it so you don’t get it 
 You ain’t did it, so you can't vision, the picture I’m painting 
 Ain't vivid, the language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya 
 See what starving'll do to ya 
 Growin' up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya 
  
 [Outro] 
 Hah, I’m just talkin’ to ya 
 I'm just talkin' through ya[Denzel Washington from American Gangster] 
 "Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City 
 He didn't own his own company 
 White man owned it, so they owned him 
 Nobody owns me though." 
  
 [Idris Elba (Angel Wood)] 
 (Your gangster is not defined) 
 Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand up to their expectations 
 "Never forgetting where we came from." 
 (Your gangster, your gangster) 
 Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch 
 But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch 
 (Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes) 
 Conservatives, labor 
 The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer 
 "See you are what you are in this world." 
 The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment 
 (Gangsterment, gangsterment) 
 Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws 
 And create brand new words, gangster mentality 
 (Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white 
 Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends 
 Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (governmentality) 
 Charted by Forbes, if you believe in Jay-Z 
 Then you too can be a gangster) then you too can be a gangster 
 By any means necessary, by owning that dream 
 I mean it's a long walk to freedom 
 But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush 
 (The war on terror screams, damn it feels good) 
 Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha 
 (To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability 
 A cliché, a bad suit, cut the bullshit 
 You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that) 
 Which we call, the American Gangster[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Come on... life... death... 
 Here... gone... yo 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 If I should die, don't cry, my niggas 
 Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas 
 And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Get on, my niggas 
 When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas 
 If I should die... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas 
 In the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas 
 I did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas 
 I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa 
 Skated through with the Caesar picadas 
 At high school got head by the lockers 
 Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers 
 Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail 
 Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street 
 Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail 
 Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck 
 Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me 
 Everybody around us become one for that day 
 To live life get your shit right and play 
 Don't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's okay 
 But life's short, don't miss a day, uhh 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 If I should die, don't cry, my niggas 
 Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas 
 And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Get on, my niggas 
 When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas 
 If I should die... 
  
 [Chorus 2: Wais] 
 ... don't cry, my niggas 
 It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas 
 Say word to Wais, my niggas 
 When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas 
 Say word is bond, my niggas 
  
 [Verse 2: Wais] 
 I got a lot to look back on, in '88 got my crack on 
 Ten years later gettin' my rap on 
 Gettin' shorties like a thespian 
 Had an episode with two lesbians, got a fetish for that 
 Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out 
 Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts 
 Been on both coasts, fired all kinds of heat 
 Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets 
 I got de-mands to meet and questions to fulfill 
 Like is that mystery God real? 
 And how was Kennedy killed? 
 I ain't mad, I must've smoked a ton of reefer 
 Sipped Coronas with Latifah, broke the code of Geneva 
 I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the 
 Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker 
 Then it's on again, if I could be born again 
 I live my life through my son 
 And tell him never have a friend 
 Just family, reincarnated I'll shorten the time 
 That I waited to get paid, tell him never be afraid 
 Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo' blood run thicker 
 Never shed tears, cry liquor, my nigga 
  
 [Chorus 2: Wais] 
 If I die don't cry, my niggas 
 It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas 
 Say word to Wais, my niggas 
 When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Just keep bangin' these songs, my niggas 
 Say word is bond, my niggas 
 If I die... 
  
 [Chorus 3: Half Dead] 
 ... don't cry my niggas 
 Just stay gettin' high, my niggas 
 Don't wonder why, my niggas 
 When I'm gone live on, my niggas 
 Just follow my path, my niggas 
 Say word to Half, my nigga 
  
 [Verse 3: Half Dead] 
 I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone 
 Born to live forever through life's struggles 
 I cut corners and took drastic measures 
 Seen niggas life expire right in front of me 
 Time could never mend what these cold streets 
 Mentally done to me, too often, I close my eyes 
 And see my own coffin feelin' haunted 
 Ready to leave this world that I'm lost in 
 My only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion 
 When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn, keep flossin' 
 As long as my name lives on what's most important 
 I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life 
 Afterlife still torchin' and blazin' these mics 
 It'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights 
 And I'd return on the 3rd like Christ 
 (Without my physical portion) 
 My spirit a poltergeist for sure 
 I'll be back through the Heights tomorrow 
 Blood over y'all fake niggas door 
 What you thought, huh? 
 What you thought, nigga? 
  
 [Chorus 3: Half Dead] 
 If I should die don't cry, my niggas 
 Just stay gettin' high, my niggas 
 Don't wonder why, my niggas 
 When I'm gone live on, my niggas 
 Just follow my path, my niggas 
 Say word to Half, my nigga 
 When I die... 
  
 [Chorus 2: Wais] 
 ... don't cry, my niggas 
 It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas 
 Say word to Wais, my niggas 
 When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas 
 Say word is bond, my niggas 
 If I die... 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 ... don't cry, my niggas 
 Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas 
 And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas 
 Get on, my niggas 
 When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas 
 If I should die... 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs 
 Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong 
 Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form 
 Is everything that's invisible gone? 
 I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic? 
 Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain? 
 Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers 
 Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place? 
 Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal? 
 If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly? 
 Can I still touch lives, answer their "whats and whys" 
 Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five? 
 If I should die... don't cry, my niggas[Intro] 
 Guru turn this shit up (OW!) 
 I know a million people already did this 
 Let's make it a billion 
 OG I'm going in! (bounce) 
 Big Bizzle, happy birthday my nigga! 
  
 [Verse] 
 Geah, a billi, a billi, a billi a billionaire 
 Call me Philli Collins, I feel a billion is in the air 
 I affiliate, with Billy Gates, that's my peer 
 And John Meneilly-onaire is my consigliere 
 When I wear Billionaire Boys Club, it's more than gear 
 I don't wear it cause Pharrell, I wear it 'cause I'm fo'real 
 (I see dead people) 
 I see Benjamins and a billion other big head people 
 I'm a natural born hustler, Marcy Projects motherfucker 
 Turned professional journalist reporting, live from the gutter 
 Where girls, carry box-cutters 
 Brothers shoot up with undercovers 
 Screaming "FUCK THE WORLD!" Why? 'Cause don't nobody love us 
 Shawn Carter, Sean Bell, what's the difference? Do tell 
 50 shots or 50 mill', ain't no difference go to hell 
 So, BRRRAK, lick a shot for, BRRRACK Obama, change gon' come or 
 I'ma buy the whole hood llamas on me 
 Roc Nation army, million strong and the mantra's gon' be 
 It is whatever it's gon' be, on three 
 Jump in the Humvee, y'all can call it Cold War 
 Declaring, I'm free, bumping 'Pac and the Outlawz 
 I'm flyer than all outdoors, I ball out hard 
 I buy, champagne companies, I'm past buying out bars 
 But I do that, I'm so past, G5's and G4's 
 But I flew, back, back and forth like Aaliyah (Rest in Peace to ya) 
 Takes a nation of millions to hold us back 
 But when your boy reach a billion it's a wrap (off of RAP?!) YEAH! 
 Roc Nation it takes a nation to stop 
 I'm signing off, it's the hood's Barack, BRRRACK!

 [Verse 1: Andre 3000] 
 I was a young lad of seventeen 
 My life had yet to show its ugly face 
 Only a pretty façade, hey God, it's me 
 Remember three, thousand 
 The one who used to pray to be a rapper 
 My child's in the third grade 
 His favorite rapper wasn't rapping 'til he heard me 
 I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Eric B 
 And Rakim's Paid in Full 
 Rap is really getting paid in full 
 So full that the kids don't go to school 
 In hopes of becoming one of us 
 The only requirement is you bust 
 Now college is looking slim, product is hooking them 
 Before their brains fully develop, they get enveloped by the  vision teller 
 The television tells them their vision 
 Now it's hard for them to make decisions without feeling 
 Uncool, unschooled, thumb rule 
 Rule of thumb, you can't be dumb 
 I wish I would've studied abroad 
 Well I studied a broad and she studied me back 
 And my course was hard 
 That was that, this is this, listen up 
 'Cause all I'm saying is 
 If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well 
 They looking for that mic or some pills to sell 
 While the girls are steady graduatin' 
 Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin' 
 'Well, should I get the new J's or the Kobe's?' 
 And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days 
 Huh, I'm a G-entleman, let's get reacquainted 
 I am Andre Benjamin 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z] 
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 I used to play the block like that 
 I used to carry knots like that 
 Now I got black cards, good credit and such 
 Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day 
 Y'all young’uns chase, I’m Patron'n it straight 
 I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez 
 Y'all drink Dom, but not Rose’ 
 Hey, ya chick shop at the mall 
 My chick burning down Bergdorf’s 
 Comin' back with Birkin bags 
 Your chick is like, 'What type of purse is that?' 
 I’m from the era where niggas don’t snitch 
 You from the era where snitchin' is the shit 
 I’m afraid of the future 
 Y'all respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter 
 Y'all go to parties to ice grill 
 I go to parties to party with nice girls 
 Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga, I’m so hot still 
  
 [Hook] 
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 Yeah, we used to ball like that 
 Now we own the ball team, holla back 
 Now I got black cards, good credit and such 
 Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha 
  
 [Verse 3: Ice Cube] 
 Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me 
 About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe 
 Nothin', nada, zero, zilch 
 I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk 
 I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' T-shirt look like a quilt 
 Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built 
 Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley 
 Nigga, don't tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe (Westside) 
 And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter 
 Burn, you motherfuckin' biter 
 Treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda 
 This is Guantanamo, think I'm a hoe 
 I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo (Yay, yay) 
 Before this mic we'll pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass 
 West Coast 
  
 Yeah, puttin' it down, nigga 
 You know, ha 
 Ice Cube, the pyroclastic flow 
 Ha, it never slow down, nigga 
  
 I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck 
 Baby boy, now I’m all grown up 
 I used to play the block like that 
 I used to carry knots like that 
 Now I got black cards, good credit and such 
 Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha[Verse 1 - Jay-Z] 
 Ay yo I got a resolution 
 This year I'm playing right 
 No 6:15 this year, yeah, you can stay the night 
 We can go bowling, it ain't like before 
 Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature 
 I was young and having money 
 Having honeys come to the crib 
 Dig in their shit 
 And they couldn't get cab money from me 
 Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge 
 I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses 
 No room service, just snacks and shit 
 Work with those Lil Debbies 
 And when you're done, get ready 
 The chicks I was fiending to smash 
 Let 'em lean on the cash 
 Will take 'em on long trips 
 Break 'em with long dick 
 There was no such thing as strong relationships 
 But I'm off that player shit 
 I need a chick that practice Tai Chi 
 That still can buy weed 
 And can give me some good head 
 And I'll make her a mami 
  
 [Hook] 
 (Hey papi!) 
 Even if they don't understand the flow 
 They understand the dough, my ladies going 
 (Hey papi!) 
 Promise you'll never let me go 
 Promise you'll never leave me 
 Promise we'll grow 
  
 [Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek] 
 The only thing Bleek spinning is 
 Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims 
 Home, suspended from school again 
 I'm grown, still ill, ladies love the ve-hi-cle, like "Bleek 
 Can I feel up on your wood and grill?" 
 It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain 
 She give me good brain 
 Love the way I push my slang 
 Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V 
 They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave 
 Bet your man can't do it like this, like this 
 I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this 
 And I'm from Marcy, you catch me on anybody's block 
 Reppin' th-the Roc 
 Hoes, they all clock like: 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3 - Jay-Z] 
 I was the worst, I used to switch chicks every day 
 Had niggas mad, for real, like, "I wish he was gay" 
 Cause they knew sooner or later hun was getting with Jay 
 Just a matter of time: she was getting with Jay 
 I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sipping on 'zae 
 Spitting up in the Pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade 
 She used to love you, but she feeling different today 
 You used to smother her. Look at your honey slipping away 
 Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space 
 She said she feel free when she's around me 
 I'm letting her do her and, in turn, she's doing me 
 She on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"[Intro: Pharrell (Jay Z)] 
 What, uh, c'mon.. uh 
 Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late 
 (Uh, uh, Young, Neptunes) 
 It's too late for that

 Don't gotta to spit that game 
 Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late for that

 Lawyers got it adjourned, 'til I squeeze 'em on him

 "The damage here along the Gulf coast is catastrophic 
 There's a frantic effort underway tonight to find survivors 
 There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight." 
  
 "People are being forced to live like animals." 
  
 "Please... send stuff here. We are desperate." 
  
 "No one says the federal government is doing a good job." 
  
 "...and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people ..." 
  
 "No water... yeah, and I fought for my country for years." 
  
 "We need help. We really need help." 
  
 "In Baghdad, they-they drop, they airdrop - water, food to people 
 Why can't they do that for their own people?" 
  
 "...the same idiots can't get a bottle of water into a 
 Major American city in three days are trying to win a war" 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 People was poor before the hurricane came 
 Before the downpour poured, it was like when Mary J. sang 
 Everyday it rains, so everyday the pain 
 Went ignored and I'm sure ignorance was to blame 
 But life is a chain, cause and effected 
 Niggas off the chain, because they affected 
 It's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective 
 From weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect, shit 
 Wouldn't you loot? If you didn't have the loot 
 Baby needed food and you was stuck on the roof 
 And helicopters swoop down just to get a scoop 
 Through his telescopic lens, but he didn't scoop you 
 And the next five days, no help ensued 
 They called you a refugee because you seek refuge 
 And the Commander-in-Chief, just flew by 
 Didn't stop, I know he had a couple seats 
 Just rude Jet blue, he's not, jet flew by the spot 
 What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped 
 Huh, that woulda been somethin' to watch 
 Helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple shots 
 Couple portraits, then ignored 'em 
 He’d be just another Bush surrounded by a couple orchids 
 Poor kids, just 'cause they was poor kids 
 Left them on they porches, same old story in New Orleans 
 Silly rappers, cause we got a couple Porsches 
 MTV stopped by to film our fortresses 
 We forget the unfortunate 
 Sure, I ponied up a mil' but I didn't give my time 
 So in reality I didn't give a dime 
 Or a damn, I just put my monies in the hands 
 Of the same people that left my people stranded 
 Nothin' but a bandit, left them folks abandoned 
 Damn, that money we gave was just a band-aid 
 Can't say we better off than we was before 
 In synopsis, this is my Minority Report 
 Can't say we better off than we was before 
 In synopsis, this is my Minority Report 
  
 [Verse 2: Ne-Yo] 
 So many times I'm, coverin' my eyes 
 Peekin' through my fingers, tryin' to hide my 
 Frustration, at the way, that we treat 
 (Seems like we don't even care) 
 Turn on the TV, seein' the pain 
 Sayin' such a shame, then tryin' to go on with my life 
 Of that, I too am guilty 
 (Seems like we don't even care) 
 So we send a little money, tell 'em it's alright 
 To be able to sleep at night 
 You will pay that price, but some of these folks 
 Has lost they whole life 
 (Seems like we don't even care) 
 And then it wasn't on the nightly news no mo' 
 Suddenly it didn't matter to you no mo' 
 It went on and almost nothin' changed 
 What the hell were they there for? 
 (Seems like we don't even care)

 One shot Dillinger, one shot killin' ya 
 It's only one Roc La Familia 
 Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me 
 Matter of fact, the East Coast, who the fuck took it from me? 
 Fourth album still Jay still spittin' that real shit

 Ex-sinner, Grammy award winner

 [Intro: Serena Altschul (Jay-Z)] 
 (Millennium flow) 
 Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse 
 (This is {bullshit} y'all) 
 In New York City for the first day in the trial of 
 (I'm gone) {*car speeds off*} 
 The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z 
 (Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh) 
 Whatever the verdict in this trial may be 
 The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice 
 Or witness to me killin' the track 
 Testify 'til me spillin' the smack 
 Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack 
 They call me dope man, dope man 
 I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man 
 Ghetto spokes-man 
 A broke man, approachin' the bench with intent 
 To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man 
 Evidence stemmin' from ninety-six 
 They say the world ain't recovered from his fix 
 While they was usin' cut, I was on some other shit 
 Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it 
 Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised 
 Listenin' to testimony about my foul ways 
 Exhibit A: Reasonable Doubt 
 They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out 
  
 [Interlude: Serena Altschul] 
 You can feel the tension building here 
 As an unprecedented number of people have turned out 
 For what may be the trial of the century 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 They call me dope man, dope man 
 I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man 
 Ghetto spokes-man 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 How come, you label your brand of dope 
 Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums? 
 Fed it to the young with total disregard 
 Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge 
 And how could you, turn right around 
 And release a lethal dosage called Vol. 2 
 And is true you operate the criminal enterprise 
 Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise? 
 And do you deny you're responsible for the demise 
 Of record execs, and do you object? 
 Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects 
 Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan 
 And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen 
 Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons 
 And we ain't gon' talk about Murder Inc 
 That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link 
  
 [Interlude: Serena Altschul] 
 The State is seeking the maximum penalty 
 And with the overwhelmin' amount of evidence 
 The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin' good 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 They call me dope man, dope man 
 I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man 
 Ghetto spokes-man 
  
 [Interlude: Serena Altschul] 
 Despite the grim outlook at this point 
 The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant 
 In the face of adversity 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 They call me dope man, dope man 
 I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
 Ghetto spokes-man 
  
 [Break: Serena Altschul] 
 Jay-Z is taking the stand 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air 
 Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear 
 A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance 
 Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands 
 But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up 
 Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up 
 Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks 
 Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors 
 Keep us spiralin', goin' backwards 
 At age nine, saw my first hate crime 
 Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line 
 Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine 
 Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined 
 Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine 
 Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine 
 The soul of Mumia in this modern day time 
  
 [Interlude: Serena Altschul] 
 While the jury is inside deliberatin' 
 Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 They call me dope man, dope man 
 I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man 
 Ghetto spokes-man 
  
 [Outro: Serena Altschul] 
 Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY! 
 It is complete pandemonium out here! 
 People are cheerin' and huggin' - there he is 
 Jay-Z is exitin' the courtroom right now 
 There is a swarm of cameras surroundin' him {*pop bulbs flashing*} 
 And people are just rushin' up to him 
 Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z! 
 {*sounds of cameras keep flashin'*}[Intro] 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Goddamnit 
 Let this shit knock 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I done turned Havana to Atlanta 
 Guayabera shirts and bandanas 
 Every time you think they got me I switch the plan up 
 Bulletproof this, radio scanners 
 Ballin' 'til they ban us 
 You gettin' too much bread, they try to jam you 
 Boy from the hood but got White House clearance 
 Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents 
 Politicians never did shit for me 
 Except lie to me, distort history 
 Wanna give me jail time and a fine 
 Fine, let me commit a real crime 
 I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef 
 Out of spite, I just might flood these streets 
 Hear the freedom in my speech 
 Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep 
 Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free 
 Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb 
 I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat 
 Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt 
 Obama said "chill, you gonna get me impeached" 
 But you don't need this shit anyway 
 Chill with me on the beach 
  
 [Hook: Swizz Beatz] 
 Y'all gon' learn today 
  
 [Verse 2: Common] 
 Common Sense 
 My man went to Cuba 
 Caught in a political triangle, Bermuda 
 The same way they said she was the shooter 
 Assata Shakur, they tried to execute her 
 I went to Cuba to see her 
 We should free her, like we should Mumia 
 Can’t a nigga rap and make movies 
 Y’all see that Fox News tried to do me 
 They say I’m too black like it’s lights out 
 Might not get invited back to the White House 
 Still with the Obamas, I ride 
 I meet the president on the Southside 
 March the streets, parade for peace 
 Shorties keep shooting, they need a release 
 Trying to eat in the belly of the beast 
 I call her LeBron, they carrying the heat 
 Y’all gon’ learn today 
 Like you’re listening to Malcolm and MLK 
 Media saying shit that ain’t there 
 But we fall down and get back up, Kevin Ware 
 It’s so political, I don’t trust figures 
 When it comes to revolution, this is us nigga 
  
 [Hook: Swizz Beatz] 
 Y'all gon' learn today 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Ya'll almost want to start a revolution 
 You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (BANG!) 
 Catch a body, head to Houston 
 I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans 
 This communist talk is so confusing 
 When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using 
 Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music 
 You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student 
 Oh, you gonna learn today 
 Where the fuck have you been 
 The world's under new management 
 The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 Little punk ass fuck, that’s it nigga (laughing) 
 That’s ballin'? 
 I guess men lie, women lie 
 But numbers don’t 
 It's over for that ballin’ 
 It's my turn 
 Brooklyn! 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We fly high, no lie, you know this (Brooklyn!) 
 Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (It's my turn) 
 We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Brooklyn!) 
 Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Brooklyn get paper, tote big things 
 We chase niggas around they own ball game 
 Ball game nigga, it's over for you lames 
 Gimme back the chain, it's over for you dames 
 Fuck y'all broads 
 Didn’t they ever tell you don’t fuck with a man’s family They'll fuck with y'all's? 
 Kidnap mine? 
 Nigga I will click-clack push your wig back further than Tyra Banks' hairline 
 Your bank versus mine 
 If you're ballin’, nigga what I’m doing can’t be defined 
 The Joneses can’t keep up 
 Maybe my nigga Nas, but I got stronger after Ether 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Bed Stuy, Brownsville, CI 
 The Best in the game since Daddy Kane and B.I 
 My turn, we live, money to burn, nigga we on fire

 I’m running a Boston on these niggas 
 I’m watching ya soundscan you keep reniggin' 
 I’m trump-tight, I'm Trump-like 
 I’m on my way to a billi, I play my cards nice 
 Niggas like "Hov, ya sound too rich!" 
 I'm like "Oh! Ain't that about a bitch?" 
 Ain't that we here for? Therefore 
 I sound like I'm supposed to sound, meet me at the Clearport 
 I’m ballin’ for real, you pump faking it 
 Manhattan keep on faking it, Brooklyn keep on taking it! Yeah! 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeahh! Shoutout to all my real niggas in Harlem 
 145th & all that

 This ain't about boroughs, this is about niggas and bitches 
 It's game time

 Let the games begin 
 YOUNG!I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game] 
 And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man] 
 And the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that] 
 Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never] 
 But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there 
 To choose one from [too many ladies, ha] 
 I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out 
  
 [Hook] 
 I love girls, girls, girls 
 Girls, girls I do adore 
 Yo put your number on this paper cuz 
 I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh 
 Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin 
 Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question 
 I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression 
 To put this in layman's terms, I gave her some knowledge 
 She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college 
 Knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring 
 In and out I'm movin through her student body union and 
 She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her 
 So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester 
 I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate 
 She said, I ain't no fool I make it up in summer school 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Now let the people sing 
 I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out 
 Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya 
 Holla at ya when I come off tour 
  
 [Verse 2: Kanye West] 
 Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick 
 I always had a P.H.D.--A pretty huge dick 
 Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this 
 And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick 
 Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only 
 2 way or phone me if you tryna bone me 
 Yo man got moe-nee, you still feel lonely 
 Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony 
 You a light skinded Nia, a dark skinned Aaliyah 
 A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita 
 You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia 
 We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia 
 It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya 
 I be goin' in and out just like a robberia 
 I’m tryna take this money like Rob and G-dep 
 Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina 
 Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams 
 And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans 
 And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream 
 And it get so bad she wanna tear up my things 
 But still, K-A-N-Y-E 
 Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C 
 She say she wanna go on a shopping spree 
 Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it 
 When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it 
 Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over 
 But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from 
 I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently 
 Just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 I thought this was America people! 
 Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh? 
 That's how we working huh? Okay 
 Before me there was many; after me there will be none 
 I am the one 
 Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playing 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait 
 Niggas had to have it way before it's release date 
 Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up 
 Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight 
 Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape 
 Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate 
 I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind 
 That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take 
 I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down 
 My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know 
 I know stress, drama, niggas upsetting my mama 
 Arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor 
 But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most 
 Out on bail, fifty thou', still riding with toast 
 I ain't trying to collide with folk 
 But I don't want folk taking Jigga for joke 
 I guess you niggas just woke - good morning! 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly] 
 (Y'all, cats, can't touch me) 
 You can't touch me, no you can't touch me 
 Jigga, Kelly, not guilty 
 Try to charge me but I'm not guilty 
 I got, all, my mamis 
 I've got all of my mamis 
 Tell me, what you, want from me 
 Tell me.. what y'all want from me? 
 I'm not guilty 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I see how you coming at me now, I'm cool 
 I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich 
 .. I go to the block and pitch 
 I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick 
 I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit 
 Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils 
 If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you? 
 Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game 
 Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted 
 Got big money, big lawyers to fight it 
 Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in 
 Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter 
 Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it 
 And my word niggas, I heard you niggas 
 I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers 
 Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever 
 B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers - above us 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)] 
 (Y'all, cats, can't touch me) 
 You can't touch me, no you can't touch me

 Try to charge me but I'm not guilty 
 I got, all, my mamis 
 I've got all of my mamis 
 Tell me, what you, want from me 
 Tell me.. (uhh, I am the one) 
 What you want from me? Not guilty 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch 
 Got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case 
 Same lame bitch I bust in her face 
 Honey just mad I got her fucking replaced 
 Plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe 
 But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick 
 But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch 
 You heard the rhetoric: "Jigga hit me over the head 
 With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?" 
 Naw, how do y'all equate your pain 
 Would it all go away if I bought you a Range? 
 I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change 
 For nothing else, you gotta live with yourself 
 Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road 
 In what, most would describe as a Rolls 
 NO, that's that Continental T 
 The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty 
  
 [Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)] 
 (Y'all, cats, can't touch me) 
 You can't touch me, no you can't touch me 
 Jigga, Kelly, not guilty 
 And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty 
 I got, all, my mamis (I am the one) 
 I've got all of my mamis 
 Tell me, what you, want from me 
 Tell me.. what you want from me? 
 Not guilty

 I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway 
 Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway 
 Me and my niggas spending half the day 
 Plotting, how we gon' get this math today without getting blast away 
 I wake up to the same problems after today 
 Life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark 
 Right from the start, they place me in the ghetto, tender age of nine 
 My tender mind had to surrender to crime 
 Wouldn't wish this on nobody life to end up like mine 
 Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in a bind 
 Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't even all it's cracked up to be 
 Niggas don't stack up to me 
 Had to hustle in a world of trouble 
 Trapped in, claustrophobic, the only way out was rapping 
 America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in 
 I'm the truest nigga to do this, nigga, and anything else is foolish 
 Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies 
 My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives 
 In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly 
 Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down 
 Shit, I floss on my off-days, fuck what they all say 
 Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong 
 All day, socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging 
 Holdin' it down on the corner with my block frozen 
 My spot is rolling, drop the price on the coke and 
 Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in 
 The cops is closing in, I can do the time 
 But what's really on my mind, there ain't no hoes in the pen 
 I play the low and try and make it hard to find me 
 Feds still tryna build a case since '93 
 I told them I'm retired, but they like whatever 
 You know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm stuck in this life forever 
 The more things change the more they stay the same 
 Who am I to change the game? 
 You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine 
 The block's hotter than its ever been 
 (Once again) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict 
 I let the nine rip, nigga say "hi" to the devil 
 I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto 
 What y'all niggas afraid of, my mind or the metal? 
 Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise 
 I carry the 9, so fucking with me just ain't the answer 
 I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh 
 Poppa raised me to chess moves 
 And though you're gone, I'm not bitter, you left me prepared 
 We got divided by the years, but I got it from here 
 Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to LeFrak 
 To that project in DC where my man caught his death at 
 Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight 
 Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen 
 Checkmate in 4 moves, the Bobby Fischer of rap with raw moves 
 In a time where we all move 
 Let's face it: either you're dough chasing or basing 
 Lacing, crack's got you feelin' strong like Mason 
 Careful, any infiltration, I'm leaving niggas 
 Leaking more than just information 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm stuck in this life forever 
 The more things change the more they stay the same 
 Who am I to change the game? 
 You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine 
 The block's hotter than its ever been 
 I'm stuck in this life forever 
 The more things change the more they stay the same 
 Who am I to change the game? 
 You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine 
 The block's hotter than its ever been 
  
 [Outro] 
 Uh, real shit, huh 
 The Black Gangsta 
 Blackhand Entertainment 
 Roc-A-Fella 
 They'll never interrupt this thing of ours 
 Uhh, The Black Gangsta 
 Jigga, Hova 
 Roll with me now[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Nigga I can make four more albums off memory! 
 Ya’ll ain’t never goin be better than me 
 I’m a do this till I’m 80 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Everybody wanna rhyme like Hov 
 Cause I rhyme like I be rhyming in the Rov' 
 Climbing in them hoes 
 Mind like a diamond, I’ll blind you at the shows 
 I don’t shine, I glow, I remind you of that dough, don’t I? 
 Did I? Hustle the game just the thought alone 
 Give me a boner Coach cater to a coma 
 Can’t out hustle a hustler, you can’t outplay a player 
 This rap shit is a layup 
 In my former biz motherfuckers would spray ya 
 In the music biz motherfuckers just say stuff 
 Spit on you and spray yeah niggas just play tough 
 When the cameras on, When the cameras gone 
 Niggas want to set up meetings 
 ‘Cause they know most likely when I see em’ I’m a set up a beating 
 Windows no tints, cars no rims 
 That’s because we handle ours like grown men 
 I ain’t touch a wheel since I drove the Bent 
 That’s cause it was a coupe, nah I ain’t souped 
 I was telling the truth and you Tom Cruise 
 You can’t handle it, handle it nigga is what I do 
 I tried to be modest on Blueprint 2 
 But ya’ll don’t respect modest, ya’ll respect ma dollars 
 You got to believe I think like a artist 
 But my bills through the roof can’t do numbers like The Roots 
 No disrespect I be trying to disconnect 
 But niggas keep pulling me back in, I’m trapped in 
 My pops got a liver disorder 
 My whole living's disordered, and I just got his living room ordered 
 And you wonder why the chip on my shoulder is more like a brick or a boulder 
 You’ll understand maybe when you get older 
 Got a hundred niggas on your dick saying you ought to record like this 
 Or what have you, niggas is back stabbing you 
 Bitches mad at you, ‘cause they can’t have you 
 Press want to know about the daughter of Matthew 
 Now it’s back to the hood again, all black hood again 
 Back to old ladies saying what I could’ve been 
 Back to the gats – you forgot I’m real good with them 
 They goin put a nigga in jail, oh well 
  
 [Hook: 50 Cent] 
 If I can’t, do it, homie it can’t be done 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I’m the one – I’m not the two not the three not the four the five 
 I take the pain from my life pour it all aside 
 Take my strain and my stride, take my ego and pride 
 Used them to kick down the door, brought my people inside 
 And I hope you, ain’t think I wrote this 
 To entertain you, cause that ain’t what I came to do 
 I will bang you, I will act like orangutans do 
 I give you hot wings turn niggas to angels 
 Understand my angle, I’m safety first, don’t make me act like the safety don't work 
 Tough niggas get it the worst, I’m begging you come for us 
 I’m giving motherfuckers dirt comforters 
  
 Night night nigga take a dirt nap… I know you hear the footsteps...Bootleggers, bombing, Bin Laden 
 I'm still crackin' 
 I will not lose, I simply refuse 
 I dropped the same date as the Twin Towers 
 I show power 
 Still I show compassion for others, sent money and flowers 
 Devote hours 
 I live in the struggle, I'm addicted to the hustle 
 I'm conflicted because, dude 
 America, this land of mine 
 Is filled with prisoners, with the same plans as mine 
 So I'm a walking contradiction 
 On one hand I love my position 
 But easily I could have been in that prison 
 And no, I am not a Christian, though I believe in God 
 But I don't believe in the devil, my beliefs are odd 
 If we the people was given freewill from God 
 How could He give the people freewill, without giving you E-vil? 
 We will hold it together, believe in the Roc 
 Long after you leave the spot 
 Long after my breathing stops 
 My spirit remains vibrant, I will lead the flock 
 And that's the tip of the iceberg 
 You might hear Christ's words in my scriptures 
 But I only write it for my niggas[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh, uh 
 Jigga Man, uh-huh MC 
 That's right 
 Swizz Beatz 
 Uh, uh, come on 
  
 [Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)] 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain 
 (Uh) 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Bounce, bounce) 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Exhale, breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain (Yeah) 
 I love you 
 (Uh come on) 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You know the flow sicker, know Jigga, mo' sicker now right 
 You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like 
 Crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic 
 Product of Reaganomics 
 You know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me 
 Ringin' in the hoops but I was too lazy 
 School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy 
 Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z 
 Let me explain this to you, baby 
 I spent nights out, days in 
 Niggas was blazing 
 Twelve noon where I was raised in 
 I felt caged in but kept roaming 
 Prayed for the Day of Atonement 
 Married to the streets no date of annulment 
 It seems every time it comes up, they postpone it 
 So I kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen 
 Savoring the moment and now you know 
 The reason that I flow the way I flow, baby 
  
 [Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)] 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain 
 (Uh) 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Bounce, bounce) 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Exhale breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain (Yeah) 
 I love you 
 (Uh come on) 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 You know I move like an ounce 
 Bottled up like crack 
 That's how I make you bounce like that 
 Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that 
 That's why no other rapper got a sound like that 
 Trap, trap of my life 
 Flashback, kill niggas 
 Rap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby 
 I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it 
 God given, guess it was all for hard living 
 Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom 
 Could've been lost in the system 
 Instead I'm involved with the rhythm 
 I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions 
 I know I must be part of some mission 
 Shit, I used take it for granted 
 Why they placed me on this planet 
 I would ask myself while writin' raps to myself 
 But right there under my nose 
 Was the flow of all flows 
 Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on 
  
 [Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)] 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain 
 (Uh) 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Bounce, bounce) 
 It's the things that you do 
 That make me feel so 
 (Exhale breathe on it for me) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can't explain (Yeah) 
 I love you 
 (Uh come on) 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 You know I've traveled through zones 
 Homes spazzed like a bad back 
 I came into this game on Jaz's back 
 I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that 
 Yeah I'm here to show and prove 
 Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin' on Clue 
 Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me 
 Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy 
 Dusty or musty, sober or saucy 
 Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby 
 Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty? 
 Past on to the next life and you still haunt me 
 I'ma keep doing me unfortunately 
 I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns 
 Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son 
 Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew 
 Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do 
  
 [Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)] 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 (Uh, exhale, inhale) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can explain 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Uh, bounce, shake, what? uh-huh) 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 (Uh-huh, inhale, exhale) 
 And I don't know the way I feel I can explain 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Bounce, shake ladies) 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 (Uh-huh, breathe for me, uh, uh-huh) 
 And I don't know the way I feel 
 I can explain 
 (Uh) 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 (Lights out niggas) 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 And I don't know the way I feel I can explain 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 And I don't know the way I feel I can explain 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do 
 It's the things that you do that make me feel so 
 And I don't know the way I feel I can explain 
 I love you 
 You thug you, look what you make the clubs do[Hook] x2 
 I can't get with that 
 I gotta keep it thick, never miss, so I hit 'em like this 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Straight to the track my lyrics is phat I rip it the fuck down 
 More than a fluke I'm regularly wreckin this shit so what now 
 So many brothers be bitin' they tongue to detect who I be 
 Well check out the J check out the A check out the Y.... Z 
 Original rap I'm makin it slap I'm hemmin it up like that 
 Stringin it, slangin it, swingin it fat, bring it back 
 I be that nigga with a gat boom-clack 
 Don't ever sweat it when I go, I zoom back 
 Better than ever, never better, you better, whatever 
 I suggest some Ex-Lax and that'll get your shit together 
 I give you a snotty nose from body blows 
 Nobody's safe at a party even Gotti goes adios 
 I got-got-got Flav-flav-flav-flavor so save yours 
 One verse and it's a hearse I played and I slayed yours 
 Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it 
 No need to prolong, Jigga the man, gone! 
 I'm out 
  
 [Hook] x2 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The next nigga never get no rest you're livin' with stress 
 Cause just around the corner be the best nigga 
 You're fearin my clout if weed got you runnin' your mouth 
 You better blow that shit out 
 The Jigga's back you niggas are flat 
 I'll amaze the way that Jay rap now how in the hell did he say that? 
 You diggin' me the epitome of rippin' it raw 
 You kiddin' me no nigga that rap gettin' bigger than me 
 Although ya niggas are wettin' my style I'm still thristy 
 And we all gotta fall off but you first G 
 I'll be the last it'll be a cold day in hell 
 Before you see me Sauce and Jaz chillin with your wack ass 
 We break shit and harmony like Take 6 
 While you niggas double pumped off the fake shit 
 Our Roc-A-Fella never sell-a-out 
 Brothers who don't have the heart you better tell your mouth nigga 
  
 [Hook] x2 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Listen 
 I don't kick it I punt it I'm so wicked you want it? 
 My tongue's just tired from lickin' my fingers and countin' up hundreds 
 So I bought a money machine and it goes 
 A tat-tit-trrrrrrr-at-tit-trrrrrt-at-tit-tit-Git-Dough 
 How many styles I gotta kick to prove I'm def? 
 I can even-kick my--rip that-shit-and catch a breath 
 I'm nicer than a bitch, ask this nigga Dash 
 Now he don't count cause I'm makin his ass rich 
 This nigga's nothin but the truth 
 Many view Jay-Z as a threat to they loot.. fuck 'em 
 My shit is tight, can't slip, gotta grip 
 Like a pit in a dog fight my shit is aight 
 I ain't checkin' for you 'less you my peoples 
 And just in case you didn't know peep the steelo 
 It goes one dime for your mind 
 And two bone crushers for your spine 
 Cause none of ya game is rougher than mine 
  
 [Hook] x2[Intro: Pain In Da Ass] 
 Sorry boys 
 But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again 
 Lay down, lay down 
 Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy 
 Always knew I'd make a stop there 
 But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought 
 The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last 
 Bleek's gonna be a good rapper 
 New, improved Jay-Z -- I quit 
 I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around 
 Sorry Big, I tried, honest 
 Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots 
 The bar's closing, where we going to for breakfast? 
 Roc-A-Fella y'all -- OKAY, I'M RELOADED! 
  
 [Bridge] 
 "Bringing the drama" 
 "Trying to come up in the game""Marcy" 
 "Add a couple of dollar signs to my name""Roc-A-Fella y'all" 
 "One of the best!" 
 "Waiting for my day to come" 
 "Just give me the word" 
  
 [Verse: Memphis Bleek] 
 Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your lil nigga Bleek 
 Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street 
 Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced 
 At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes 
 Peep the steez, I represent for all those 
 With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys 
 Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys 
 Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's 
 First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it 
 Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't? 
 Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's 
 Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger 
 You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her 
 Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us 
 Shit is constant, that's why I pack the 
 Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it? 
 I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall 
 Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all 
 That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all 
 Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead 
 One week of this hustling brought a living room set 
 Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out 
 Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out 
 Flashy, fly little nigga 
 Nosy bitch from the third floor like "Why little nigga?" 
 Bitch please, twist the trees 
 Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe 
 That's my answer, life's like cancer 
 And I'm serious 
  
 [Outro] 
 "Waiting for my day to come" 
 "Just give me the word"[Intro] 
 I told you Ms. Carter... Here we are 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 (Momma, I made it) 
 You know how I do it like The DOC do it, I fly through it 
 That's how I operate, (momma, I made it) 
 Ghetto like the grease when you getting ya hair braided 
 Sweeter than ya sister Kool-Aid is 
 Hooray!! It's the underdog now my feet 
 On the desk I'm the Presidential favorite 
 Can't believe I got away with 
 My earliest stages to being on stages 
 Having my way with the world, congratulations!! 
 Your baby boy's a made man I'm a hold the fam down like three generations 
 I'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands 
 Reminiscing bout the foundation you gave em 
 For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed 
 All I ask is you raise your glass in this celebration 
 Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world 
 My inspiration thanks for the information 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Momma I made it... momma I made it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Out in BK where 
 It ain't everyday that you make it out 
 Be on top of yachts waving 
 I remember you saving for the light bill, paid the rent with the light bill 
 Now our crib dark as a basement 
 Had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home 
 We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic 
 Our cable was basic no HBO, WHT, just Ralph McDaniels on the station 
 I aggravated you for Atari and ColecoVision pinstripe Lee's 
 When the first day of school came in 
 I was okay with not having everything 
 Long as Saturdays you had the Commodores playing 
 The expression on your face was priceless 
 Still with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it 
 I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made 
 You deserve a standing ovation 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Momma I made it... momma I made it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Now your lil misfit make sure every day is Christmas, write out your wish list 
 6's, wrist is glistening you don't even like jewels 
 But you could get missing anywhere you like to 
 Where the waters light blue, anything you order 
 Sign it to your nice room leave a extra tip, ma 
 Be extra nice to 'em 
 CEO of Carter Foundation, wow! 
 I know pop looking down 
 I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds like 
 Go get 'em Grandma make me proud 
 Didn't have a man in the house so you made one 
 So I act like your husband and I'm only your son 
 I told you one day I'd get you a home 
 I didn't know it could possibly be in Rome 
 Told me don't wait on nobody, get your own 
 So with me myself and my microphone, I made it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Momma I made it... momma I made it[Intro] 
 Uh, yeah, mmmm 
 William H., niggas 
 Holla, yeah, yo 
  
 [Chorus] 
 That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 That's how most of these so called gangstas pass 
 I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down 
 When I greet ya, meet ya with pound 
 Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake 
 The kind that put land over your face 
 I pop ya, let doctor stitch ya 
 I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya 
 I move light, like my shoes too tight 
 Leave niggas confused from the day to the night 
 At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparking 
 Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barking 
 I keep cash 'case cops arrest me 
 'case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me 
 You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent 
 If not you, somebody of close descent 
 Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he 
 Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey 
 Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult 
 Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke 
 And y'all choke, motherfuckers 
  
 [Chorus] 
 That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 That's how most of these so called gangstas pass 
 I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Yo, I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he 
 Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey 
 Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult 
 Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke 
 Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he 
 Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey 
 Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult 
 Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke 
 And y'all choke, niggas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 That's how most of these so called gangstas pass 
 I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Y'all don't understand 
 I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he 
 Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey 
 Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult 
 Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke 
 And y'all choke, niggas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I, squeeze first ask questions last 
 'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 See when I'm low on digits, I push blow in a blizzard 
 I'm a player for real, I post and pivot 
 Coke distribute, be where the ghostes visit 
 Where the demons live, shit, my scene is vivid 
 Squeamish kids, y'all get the fuck outta this verse 
 It's about to get so obscene in a minute 
 I seen and live it, I did some things I admit it 
 Wasn't proud of it, but I was a child, fuck it 
 Kept a pow tucked in a brown belt 
 Couldn't sit down, big gun kept sticking my pelvis 
 Shit, it was either that or be living with Elvis 
 Niggas is jealous, hell is hot, you heard X 
 Wanted to tell God that I don't deserve this 
 Was afraid that he'd tell me I deserve less 
 My life was nervous, you haven't heard stress 
 'Til you heard the cries of my mama, me giving her drama 
 Told her I ain't promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day 
 And before she could say Jay... 
 I was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality 
 Men gotta do men things for men salary 
 Bad Boy, not Puff or Mike Lowery 
 Damn B.I.G. woulda been proud of me 
  
 [Outro] 
 Ahh shit man... 
 Young Hova, ya heard? 
 Who could fuck with him? 
 Uh, uh, geah[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Bounce 
 Uhhh, ha, uhhh, ha 
 Uhhh, uh-huh-uh-uhhh, uhh, uh-huh 
 This for my hustlers.. uh-huh 
 And for the bitches.. yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, yo 
 This is for my niggas down in Houston on candy paint 
 All my niggas in the Dirty South, Miami mayne 
 All my niggas in the A-T-L throwin' dem bows 
 All them thugs that send slugs through your clothes; holla at me! 
 It's for the black culture, Spanish chicks with the sweet chocha 
 Spanish cats with the keys of coca 
 All the haters eat a dick, they wanna see you brok-er 
 I hope the heat stroke ya, the misery is over 
 All my deep smokers, I hope the leaf choke ya 
 Hope you'll never be sober, I'ma toast to myself 
 I hope the Cris' get me, spiralin' into a tizzy 
 So pissy, swervin' on the road dizzy 
 May God protect my soul, angels walk with me 
 First do the flow sickly, niggas is so shifty 
 The fo'-fo' is like a force field, you won't get me 
 I brought some folk with me, Brooklyn is loc'n with me 
 What the fuck? 
  
 [Chorus: Juvenile] 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 This is for my chicks that get dough for takin' off they clothes 
 All them money makin' honies that slide down the poles 
 All my educated chicks who grade is 4.0 
 All the baby mamas across the globe; ayo 
 I like my women friends feminine 
 I like my hoes on "X" like Eminem, shit! 
 I like em bow-legged, never coke-headed 
 With a dough fetish, the drive to go get it 
 I like they toes proper, I like they clothes Prada 
 I like they shoes Gucci, I like new coochie 
 I fucked a few groupies, in a few hoopties 
 I got 'em Iceberg shit they thought I knew Snoopy 
 I cop them Rocawear, my mamis dedicated 
 They never tell me no, the most they said is "not here" 
 I got they ears studded, both wrists baguetted 
 I got a main chick, a mistress, and a young bitch 
 Forget it, I'm the don 
  
 [Chorus: Juvenile] 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Wha-what? 
 This is for my dice shooters, cats doin' life 
 By the time I get this kite to ya, I hope you doin' alright 
 Who got 'em platinum up? Who got the chicks in the truck? 
 Too much to sit comfortably, they lappin' up 
 Who shit is big pimpin'? See the flow different 
 I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip 'em 
 I keep rappers talkin' to kids, Jigga Sixth Sense'd 'em 
 Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence 
 You see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough 
 Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel 
 Keep the flow Hova; icy neck, cold shoulder 
 Who click is closest to La Costra Nostra? 
 It's The Roc 
  
 [Chorus: Juvenile] 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life 
 You know, we ride 
 All day, all night 
 Pop Cris', shoot dice 
 Fuck hoes, for life[Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
  
 [Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh uh, yeah 
 I remember y'all niggas 
 Used to slap box y'all niggas 
 And smack y'all up, y'all used to see stars 
 We play corners (?) shit 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin' a club 
 Throwin' a shot down, tryin' to stay above 
 Ground, another round-breakin' day in the club 
 Surrounded by my own thoughts, playin' a cut 
 Reminiscin' on days I ain't have a pot to piss in 
 No watch to glisten, no V's with hot systems 
 Missin' my homies that passed right in front of my eyes 
 Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies 
 On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong 
 Had to get our shit together and move it along 
 Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas 
 Drivin' the hottest cars, movin' out with our moms and I'm 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 Wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Thoughts interrupted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit 
 Back in the days when I was movin' much shit, "What up chick?" 
 Maintainin', it's the same old thang 
 A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed 
 I see you kept it movin', you see I kept improvin' 
 She nodded her head in agreement 
 Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin' it down 
 Knew the 'Streets was Watching', stay hooded down 
 Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now? 
 She said, "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye" 
 I was too deep for you from day one 
 That's why we never had relations, continued in my own zone 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey (Jay-Z)] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done (uh-huh) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks 
 Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark 
 Wanted to be like the older males, sneak and drink old champ-ale 
 Dangerous games we played on the third rail 
 Fiend for the summer breeze, hopped out the Lee's Dungarees 
 Into the Hawaiian shorts, relyin' on sports 
 To take us away from here, but I cut too much 
 So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush 
 In the mirror, my siblings used to back me up 
 Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me 
 All my niggas is you with me, each of y'all 
 Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga! 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done[Verse 1] 
 Gentrify your own hood, before these people do it 
 Claim eminent domain and have your people movin’ 
 That’s a small glimpse into what Nipsey was doing 
 For anybody that’s still confused as to what he was doing 
 The neighborhood is designed to keep us trapped 
 They red line us, so property declines if you live by blacks 
 They depress the asset and take the property back 
 It’s a ruthless but a genius plan in fact 
 So now we fighting over scraps 
 Crabs in a barrel, but crabs don’t belong in the barrel and they ain’t never tell us that 
 So in the barrel, we gonna act like we act 
 We can easily get out the barrel if we stand on each other’s back 
 Whoever gets on top, as long as they stay attached 
 They gonna pull everybody out—I was doing just that 
 I told Neighborhood Nipsey stay close 
 There’s a 100 million dollars on your schedule, lay low 
 Tell your team to be on point in the places that they go 
 I never dreamed that he get killed in the place that he called home 
 How we gonna get in power if we kill the source? 
 Y’all like to run off on the plug, so of course 
 That ain’t lit, that’s a means to an end 
 Me and my team was playing the plug ahead of plan 
 Sometimes we was only making a $1000 a joint 
 That ain’t no money, but that ain’t main point 
 So those 92 bricks was only 92 thou 
 So y’all can close your mouth, it ain’t nothing for y’all to wild (Wow) 
 But it is something to study 
 We was chasing our goals, not chasing money 
 Niggas chasing hoes, we find that funny 
 I pull up in the Rolls, that hoe gon’ want me 
 But I don’t want no hoe, I want a wife 
 Somebody to bounce these ideas off at night 
 I be going to sleep hoping Nip visit me 
 That young king had a lot of jewels to split with me 
 And we ain’t gotta leave the hood physically 
 But we gotta leave that shit mentally 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Some how, some way 
 We gonna make it out the hood some day[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Jigga Man, Swizz Beatz 
 History in the making, part three 
 Lights out ladies! 
  
 [Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)] 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder) 
 Make me scream your name 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters 
 Busters they wanted to rush us 
 Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya 
 When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right 
 You can light up the whole room, turning day from night 
 When the summertime is in and the tops are down 
 With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right) 
 It took short sleeves and lounging to understand 
 The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze 
 Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you 
 And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you 
 The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do 
 I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools 
 Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you 
 So I devoted half my time to invest in you 
 The other half was spent on protecting you 
 'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me 
 C'mon 
  
 [Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)] 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder) 
 Make me scream your name 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I'm often with you, so they wonder 'bout the juice I got 
 I took you from the projects and an abusive pops 
 From the bottom to the top 
 The skateboard to the drop 
 From the nada to the Prada 
 I got ya like I got ya 
 From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya 
 It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow 
 Soon I spent every dollar, you became my habit 
 Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats 
 The more checks I got the more I laced my crew 
 The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue 
 Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my boo 
 Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too 
 Cop my jewels twice, like déjà vu 
 If they ever met in the mall, it was over y'all 
 Just the way I do, and either way you win 
 I mean the thugs love ya when you're girl's best friend 
  
 [Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)] 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name (and all my ladies sing) 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 In the wedding band you love, in the gold chain you thug 
 Sometimes you given just because 
 And the tennis bracelet means they want relations 
 Know that they wanna fuck, the only reason they give you up 
 In the hands of gold diggers you never enough 
 Rings, things, just never enough 
 But me and you together gon' shine to the end 
 I mean the thugs love ya, but ya girl's best friend 
  
 [Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)] 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?) 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing) 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name 
 C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy 
 Don't want nobody but you my baby 
 Hold me tight and call me your lady 
 Make me scream your name[Hook x2] 
 When the money goes, will the honey stay? 
 When the grey skies replace the sunny days 
 Hey, hey, hey 
  
 When the top back, I know I got that 
 But when I'm locked up... 
 Shit, Guru, let me get that again 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 When the money goes, will the honey stay? 
 When the grey skies replace the sunny days 
 Hey, hey, hey 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I got it now... 
 When my top back, I know I got that 
 But when I'm locked up, and I'm not back 
 And I collect call, will she accept that? 
 Will she stay down, through my setbacks? 
 Through my downfalls, and my downpours 
 When them FBI boys is coming down for us 
 I know you ride with a nigga through the Gucci store 
 All through Prada, but what if I had nada? 
 Would the babe even bother if the block got hotter? 
 In the never-ending game that pits the cops versus robbers? 
 Am I your Clyde, or are you just along for the ride? 
 When I'm blasting out the window, will you grab the wheel and drive? 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 When the money goes, will the honey stay? 
 When the grey skies replace the sunny days 
 Hey, hey, hey 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 When I fall off, and the drought hits 
 And it knocks me, out new outfits 
 And the charm you got gotta hit the pawn shop 
 And you feel like crying, but be strong and stop 
 It was all good just a week ago 
 Now I'm wearing the same clothes a week in a row 
 Trying to scratch back 
 Would she take a little check from her little job like 
 "Nigga, you can have that" 
 You have belief in me, or would you beef with me? 
 Is the good life the only thing you needed from me? 
 Would she roll out? Is she so out, when the stoves out? 
 Or will she hold out? 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 When the money goes, will the honey stay? 
 When the grey skies replace the sunny days 
 Hey, hey, hey 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 And your friends know what Hov get it in for 
 But let's just say that I didn't ride Benzo 
 Would you say, "Girl, why you still with him for?" 
 And if so, babe, why you around them hoes? 
 All they see is paper, not potential 
 And they don't have a nigga's back when he's in limbo 
 And I ain't asking you to do a life bid with me 
 I don't want you to die for me, baby, live with me 
 I'm just saying, when the going gets rough 
 Don't forget all the shine at the time I was showing up 
 Show me the same love you showed me when blowing up 
 You told me it was Roc for life, then throw it up 
  
 [Hook x2] 
 When the money goes, will the honey stay? 
 When the grey skies replace the sunny days 
 Hey, hey, hey[Verse 1] 
 My first brick did it 
 I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four 
 Then I whipped it to more 
 And it's like the streets call you: 
 "How could you leave me after all I done for you? 
 Who else would employ you? I made you feel royal 
 All it took was some oil, some water 
 Some baking soda to make you Hova" 
 My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling 
 I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm addicted to the game 
 The shit keeps calling my name 
 I need to shoot 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Ain't you afraid to go to jail? God 
 Well use your brain, are you sane? 
 But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins 
 And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall 
 I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw 
 And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play 
 The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay 
 And I, need the green like fiends need yay' 
 And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm addicted to the game 
 The shit keeps calling my name 
 I need to shoot 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I rap now, I eat good 
 I smoke good, drink good 
 Multi-millionaire but still I think hood 
 Belly full, I can't shake it 
 The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation 
 I guess it's just the need to be heard 
 I need niggas to say, "I can't believe ya words" 
 I'm just an addict, addicted to music 
 Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it 
 Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is 
 Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color 
 Ha, I guess I'm more like 
 A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha 
 Y'all don't understand me still 
 I'll never enjoy my success but my family will 
 And I'm alright with that 
 So the rap Jerry Rice is back 
 To fulfill the need, though I lead the league 
 I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed 
 Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova 
 Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up 
 It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue 
 Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step 
 Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed 
 Until I'm one with the music 
 'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I'm addicted to the game 
 The shit keeps calling my name 
 I need to shoot[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh 
 Uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh 
 I ain't tryin to be rude dude 
 But give a nigga some space 
 I ain't tryin to be rude dude 
 Just, give a nigga some space 
 Just tryin to talk honey dog 
 I ain't got time to waste (check it) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Why is you over here lookin' at me 
 While all these girls up in here? 
 What you gay? Nigga, Jay straight like Indian hair 
 Y'all don't want me to spray the semi in here 
 I mean if you a fan I consider you fam' 
 But shake a nigga hand, well shit god damn 
 All that ("Do you remember me dawg?") Nah I'm drawin' a blank 
 You got me feelin like a fish, in a fish tank 
 Just think, if you came to a club 
 Tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love 
 'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug 
 You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way! 
 And kill the ice grill holmes 
 'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away 
 I came in some sweats, I came to get met 
 Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to "next!" 
 We exit stage left, hop in her Lexus 
 Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es 
 .. may I suggest that it's 
 A lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses 
 .. go find you one 
 Go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn 
 .. go find you one 
 Go get your dance on, go grind on one 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Quick question - yo, why you over here? 
 So many hoes in here 
 My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there 
 It's so many hoes in here 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude dude, whyon'tcha disappear? 
 There's so many hoes in here 
 I understand you got issues but I really don't care 
 There's so many hoes in here 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah yeah yeah I know you rap and your sister spit too 
 You been callin' the office and you can't get through 
 I understand all that, but now ain't the time 
 I came to the club to get that off my mind 
 And all you thugs with your war stories startin' to bore me 
 I ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory 
 I'm tryin' to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from N.O.R.E 
 And you keep talkin' over the beat like Clue ("Do you remember?") 
 .. go find somethin' to do 
 You're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw 
 Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel 
 Play hide and seek witchaself for real, huh 
 The chick came dressed up just to get messed up 
 She got her hair done, just to get it sweated up 
 Shit I'm tryin' to help her out 
 Whyon'tcha help me out and be out? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Quick question - yo, why you over here? 
 So many hoes in here 
 My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there 
 It's so many hoes in here 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude dude, whyon'tcha disappear? 
 There's so many hoes in here 
 I understand you got issues but I really don't care 
 There's so many hoes in here 
 Jeah, jeah, jeah 
  
 [Timbaland] 
 You're invadin' my space 
 You need to, be easy, ahh 
 You're invadin' my space 
 You need to, be easy, ahh 
 You're invadin' my space 
 C'mon dawg, be easy, ahh 
  
 [Timbaland] 
 Uh-uh, I don't know why they do that 
 Heh, I don't understand 
 Heh, what you need to do, is.. 
  
 [Timbaland] 
 Stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here 
 Stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here 
 Stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here 
 C'mon dawg, stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here 
 Be easyThey call me eight shows H-O 
 You can stunt like that when you own the whole place, though 
 This is Rich Porter, part two 
 You can stunt like that when you're rich before your debut 
 Money and the murder, rapper or the trapper 
 Either way I'm gon' serve ya 
 Shooters on my team... No really, I got shooters on my team 
 Juan or Deron 
 How you niggas want it, pick a arm 
 They call me Lucky Lefty... 
 Ball so hard, I don't respect the fuckin' refereesWhen Im Alone In My Room Sometimes I Stare At The Wall 
 But In The Back Of My Mine I Hear my conscience Call 
 Telling Me I Need A Girl Who's As Sweet As A Dove 
 But Fuck That My Name HOV And You know Im Thug 
 So If You Stuck Off Love i Suggest You Get Over It 
 Ma Cry Me A River Build A Bridge And Get Over It 
 They Love It When Im Hard On Hoes 
 They Said A G Don't Give A Bitch No Keys Or Security Codes 
 I Agree My Lady Ain´t No Bitch She Get Whatever I Own 
 So When You See Understand Thats Me Nigga 
 Understand Im still the same OG Nigga 
 I know the difference between a bitch and a B, Nigga[Verse 1] 
 I'm so far ahead of my time I'm 'bout to start another life 
 Look behind you; I'm 'bout to pass you twice 
 Back to The Future, gotta slow up for the present; I'm fast 
 Niggas can't get past my past 
 How you propose a deal with the perfect present? 
 When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session? 
 Ain't no living person can test him 
 Only two resting in Heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him 
 7 straight summers; critics might not admit it 
 But nobody in rap did it quite like I did it; 
 If you did, I done it before 
 You get it, I had it; 
 I got mad at it, I don't want it no more 
 And that comes from everything, from flippin' that raw 
 Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal cords 
 Don't get it twisted, get it right 
 Did it different, did it better, did it nice 
 Did the impossible, and then I did it twice 
 Young! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Young H.O., fresh from Italy 
 Trip financed by my best ability 
 Same one helped me in extra realty 
 For my mom, for my nephews, a bunch of lil' me's 
 Flip flop by Versace, hip-hop got me here 
 Music made me a millionaire, yeah 
 Multi for what's inside of here 
 Inside my heart, besides that, I'm smart 
 Prepare poems with a passion, at the same time cash in 
 Took the best of both worlds minus the madness 
 Though controversy follows me everywhere I dock 
 Everything I hear I block 
 Out like the jealous clouds do the sun 
 Then I sit back and recline since my shine has shone 
 And then sure nuff bust out something foreign with the doors up 
 Maybe the lilac Porsche 
 The lavender Retriever 
 I only bring my homies back purple reefer 
 I only smoke in Ibiza 
 In Capri, somewhere foreign that you need your visa 
 Yup, Hovi's home; but it's like I never left, I had the global phone 
 Yup, yeah I stayed in touch 
 I heard y'all back home complaining, y'all complain too much 
 So hateful, bunch of dudes I put on out there acting so ungrateful 
 But daddy's home, and he brought the forty autie-matie chrome 
 For all the chatty-chatty y'all been doing 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 While y'all was running your mouth complaining about Summer Jam 
 I was in flip-flops in the South of France 
 See how it flip-flops with the number one station for hip-hop and r&b? 
 You thought Summer Jam was starring you? It was starring me 
 Even in my absence, my presence is felt 
 That gotta tell you I'm the king, dog, if nothing else 
 I'm on another continent, you still ain't content 
 I'm in the Mediterranean, you still ain't vent 
 Explain to me why I want to be you again 
 You on the radio crying, I'm learning to swim[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 This that futuristic shit, bitch 
 It don't stop, I can't stop 
 These cats ain't never touched nothing, ain't never gonna touch nothing 
 Spend too much of their time gossiping and shit 
 You know? 
 That's something else though 
 We'll address that at a later date though 
 Everything must be addressed though 
 You know? 
 Nothing slides 
 Word up 
 It's murder 
 Dead or alive 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 My skills are, and will remain, ahead of you guys 
 And ain't nothing gon' change that, dead or alive 
 Any ill feelings I harbor y'all can blame it on the vibe 
 Don't know when to let go and let young souls die 
 See a nigga diss me, ain’t nothing new, understand? 
 But it's how I retaliate which defines who I am 
 Jay-Z, ain't nothing dead or alive playing me 
 I take beef to the grave, that's how my momma raised me 
 She told me, "Fight in your afterlife, never revamp your story" 
 So Heaven or Hell, niggas better have some answers for me 
 Hollering shit from '89, Hawaiian Sophie 
 God damn y'all been on my dick a long time 
 (It's murder) 
  
 [Verse 2: Sauce Money] 
 Welcome to the Terror Dome 
 You error prone niggas sick 
 Roc-A-Fella clique thick as herring bones 
 What legends are made of 
 Like whenever accurates hit 
 My voice locked behind bars to a bid for this spectacular shit 
 Fake kids fold and lie, holding why? 
 Saw a half a million sales with a golden eye 
 Patrol the sky to see bucks 
 GS the fucks Yukon GMC trucks 
 Slugs ease the pain to your brain when thugs squeeze 
 More we stuck in, bust shots till we chuckin' 
 You saw the faggot let em know more could have it 
 Automatic rhyme spot 4 shot towards his attic 
  
 [Hook: Both] 
 It's murder 
 Dead or alive 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 If it's jewels you like 
 You fools gonna fuck around and lose your life 
 And I just bruise your wife 
 Don't get it confused right cause we in the spotlight 
 Still I hold the Glock with the wrist twist like these 
 Gangsta shit no thanks to shit 
 Niggas selling a million records more banks to split 
 Jay-Z motherfucker, who you think this is? 
 Introduction Sauce motherfuckin' crank this shit 
  
 [Verse 4: Sauce Money] 
 I heard his body was too hot to get near it 
 Too late to hear it 
 Two slugs wait to release his spirit 
 The known truth: had a bad habit for blowing loot 
 Two niggas on the roof busting down at the phone booth 
 Running for cover at point blank cause bullets is hovering 
 Drug them in after the slug went in 
 I take a phrase in God we trust it's a must 
 Live by the gun die by the same shit you bust 
 Fly bitches with waves from DC to Cali 
 Rally and tally up my dough for the grand finale 
 Grapevines throughout the alley unknown figures said 
 Trigger lead knew how bad we needed the nigga dead 
 Thoughts of hating sober intoxicated minds is taking over 
 Conjure all ways escape closer 
 Never spar drove the car to the edge of the tar 
 With intentions to scar, shooting motherfuckerss to Allah[Intro] 
 Let's try this, Guru 
 (Every time I think about you) yeah yeah 
 (I feel so alive) 
 (I wish I could hold onto you forever) 
 This is how I start my day anew 
 Uhh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, uhh 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life) 
 Good morning America, ghetto USA 
 (Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures 
 Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas) 
 Uhh, come on, good morning 
 It was the best of times, it was the worst of times 
 (The sunshine was shining, you were on my mind) 
  
 [Verse] 
 Yeah, I wake up, hit my shoebox, I snatch out a few rocks 
 Put the rest inside, now I'm ready to ride 
 Put the bomb in my socks so cops can't locate the vials 
 I ain't freshly dressed but got a Colgate smile 
 That's right, hah 
 Throw on the same clothes I had on last night 
 I got loads of capers to come up with this paper 
 I got money schemes that come to me in my dreams 
 Hit the block like a veteran 
 Fiends need they medicine, I'm the relief pitcher 
 Their clean up hitters, it works 
 I hit the Ave stash the bag in the dirt 
 Put the rest in my small pocket, I start clockin' 
 (I woke up early this morning) 
 Same routine: I'm runnin' game to fiends 
 Exchangin' cash for crack rocks, back and forth to my stash box 
 Hundred dollars a week 
 Shorties got the Ave watched, fiends swarm 
 I'm gettin' rid of this bomb, as I 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life 
 Good morning 
 (Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures 
 Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas) 
 I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life 
 The sun was shinin', you were on my mind 
 I woke up early this morning..[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (this ain't music) 
 I'm 'bout to show you how a hustlers life (this is life man) 
 And a soldier's life, parallel 
 And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain 
 (Forget about me for a second) 
 Picture split screen (forget musicians) 
 On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings) 
 Other side you got the soldier (people) getting ready for boot camp (it's life) 
 They're both at war 
 Stay with us 
  
 [Chorus: Marc Dorsey] 
 Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You lost him mama, the war's calling him 
 Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them 
 He's a soldier 
 Rose through the ranks as the head of your household 
 Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta 
 Now just remember why he's gone 'til November 
 It's part of him growing up 
 His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya 
 Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up 
 Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds 
 A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps 
 Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror 
 Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan 
 Crack was anthrax back then, back when 
 Police was Al'Qaeda to black men 
 While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion 
 He was off to war killing for a living 
  
 [Chorus: Marc Dorsey] 
 Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Days turn to nights, nights turn to years 
 Years turn to, "How the fuck we make it in here?" 
 My barracks average couple fights a day 
 Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day 
 And I feel like I'm just writing my life away 
 I never thought shit could end up quite this way 
 There's a war going on outside no man is safe from 
 I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run 
 I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one 
 For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living? 
 I love my niggas more than anything else 
 This war's about my family, me needing the wealth 
 You don't understand how useless as men we felt 
 'Til you become a 5 star general 
 Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail 
 P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real 
  
 [Chorus: Marc Dorsey] 
 Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
  
 [Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z (Marc Dorsey)] 
 Your baby boy is getting grown 
 So your baby boy is moving on 
 I've gotta chase it 
 I'm gon' chase it 
 And I'm gon' make it, gon' make it 
 Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown 
 So your baby boy is moving on 
 I'm gonna make it, I'm gon' make it 
 Even if I gotta chase it 
 You gotta take it, wooo, yeah 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man 
 This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam 
 He ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand 
 Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam 
 It's death before dishonor 
 And if he's gone you should honor his memory 
 Don't cry we all gonna die eventually 
 But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy 
 They all winners to me, what's up Emory 
  
 [Chorus: Marc Dorsey] 
 Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, it's that knock right here 
 You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system 
 Your shit be soundin' like this {*funny sounds*} 
 Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed 
 Get brain in the four-dot-six Range 
 Shit mane, switch lanes 
 Every town I hit, switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine 
  
 [Verse 1 : Jay-Z] 
 I givin' 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast 
 Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a sick stash 
 Continental T's, no tints like I got a thick stack 
 Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny 
 Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's 
 Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass 
 I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels 
 I got money for a room, it's just the fact that I'm trill 
 Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard 
 They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard 
 They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad 
 Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage 
 Just mackin' this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless 
 Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless 
 Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office 
 'Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es 
 When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious 
 Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers 
 'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous 
 Standin' in the Azure with white Air Forces 
  
 [Chorus: Lil' Mo] 
 You can catch me in the parkin' lot 
 Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs 
 Tryin' to find out where them dollars at (dollars at) 
 So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back) 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Ain't nothin' different, parkin' lot pimpin' 
  
 [Verse 2 : Beanie Sigel] 
 Holla at me mami! Sigel.. 
 You can catch Mack in the parkin' lot, pimpin' crazy 
 S-5, Navy 'Cedes, sittin' on 80 
 That's four dubs, not S-4 dub 
 Stash box, push Hot Wheel like Matchbox 
 Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box 
 160, push my wheel, mash cops 
 Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop 
 Run 60, you Big Will, match cop 
 Lookin through the rear view and Mack was wylin' 
 New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steerin' column 
 Pushin' somethin' stolen, blastin', picture me rollin' 
 Back then couldn't picture me rulin' 
 Now the truth different, Mack come through Coupe roof missin' 
 I'm the truth 'til my fuckin' roof missin' 
 Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons 
 Feathers gettin' plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen 
  
 [Chorus: Lil' Mo] 
 You can catch me in the parkin' lot 
 Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs 
 Tryin' to find out where them dollars at (dollars at) 
 So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back) 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Ain't nothin' different, parkin' lot pimpin' 
  
 [Verse 3 : Memphis Bleek] 
 Yo, ayo I dip dip dive, what can I say? 
 I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade 
 So I called up, murder to further my parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin' 
 Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand 
 Car movin' slow, driven by the invisible man 
 Everything on the dash, digital and 
 I got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man 
 In the parkin' lot, where I spark a lot 
 I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks 
 Bleek, turn up the beats.. 
 .. turn up the heat then we burn up the streets, bitch! 
  
 [Chorus: Lil' Mo] 
 You can catch me in the parkin' lot 
 Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs 
 Tryin' to find out where them dollars at (dollars at) 
 So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back) 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Ain't nothin' different, parkin' lot pimpin' 
 You can catch me in the parkin' lot 
 Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs 
 Tryin' to find out where them dollars at (dollars at) 
 So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back) 
 Everyday we be off the chains 
 Ain't nothin' different, parkin' lot pimpin'[Intro] 
 Geyeah, NYMP the realest, uhh 
 This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggas 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive 
 Blocks'll have you, tryin' to maintain your course 
 Through the potholes and gravel 
 Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin' to clock dough 
 Foes tryin' to pop shots through you by code 
 Pigs tryin' to grab you and lock up your soul 
 Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle 
 (Bucka bucka bucka) fiends tryin' to gaffle you 
 Not only coke heads but the Feds in the Mercury Topaz 
 After you, up the avenue 
 Tryin' to give you big numbers, you got math to do 
 Tryin' to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool 
 I caught smaller cases tryin' to get capital 
 Up against the wall, tryin' to pass through 
 Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls 
 Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Uhh, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas 
 N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas 
 Uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest 
 Marcy.. Brooklyn.. 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo, I come through, gettin' money, sittin' on twenties 
 Niggas throwin' me shade, but ain't shit sunny 
 Hot shells only thing niggas could get from me 
 Cocktails thrown in your livin' room, KA-BOOM! 
 I'm so confrontational 
 They shoulda never let me go on probation yo 
 I'm a hustler, except that.. 
 No correctional facilities can correct that 
 I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at 
 It's where that dough is homie, gotta get that 
 Gotta get away, some try but head back 
 Uhh, street smart niggas got left back 
 Some died, they left stacks 
 Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice 
 Jigga been cold as fuck before ice 
 Not before Christ, but a long fuckin' time 
 Get your mind right niggas 
  
 [Chorus] 
 N.Y.M.P., the realest 
 Uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas 
 Uhh uh-huh, uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggas 
 Marcy.. feel me.. 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I looked death in the face years back 
 I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back 
 I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live 
 You gotta bounce back homie, the streets don't give 
 I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him? 
 Not Rudy Giuliani, not Hillary Rodham 
 Still I still pop him 
 Shit, I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now 
 I think big when I spit at you now 
 Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha 
 Between life and death, they killed my spirit 
 So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball 
 I empowered myself, teacher said I was a lost cause 
 'Cause I used to roam them halls 
 Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college 
 Who woulda thought I'd make it "Big" like Ms. Wallace? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Uhh, yeah, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas 
 Brooklyn, what? Uhh, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas 
 Uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggas 
 Marcy.. New York, Brooklyn, N.Y.M.P. the realest, feel me 
  
 [Outro] 
 Educated, thug mu-sic niggas 
 This is Brooklyn, this is gangsta, this is project 
 Real shit, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggas 
 Marcy, Brooklyn, stompin' grounds 
 Fuck with me[Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Hanging with the honeys is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things, check 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 We started out makin', small time bacon 
 Two little niggas bakin', talkin' 'bout whippin' cakes 
 Get clothin' and big cheddar, hopin it gets better 
 We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever 
 In front of your building clockin', thought I was makin' a killin' 
 Right in front of your children, eight-ball in my side pocket 
 They was corrupt too, disrespectin' the fiends I used to 
 Look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you 
 In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York 
 I'm hollerin' Lifetimes, he hollerin' Life's Too $hort 
 Parallel lives and jew-els held high 
 The Range or the rove, get exchanged, for your soul 
 You know how the game goes, slang to get cheese 
 And speak in Chinese, everybody gains the same dough 
 Get your shit scarred fuckin' with my sick squad 
 From Marcy, to the Bay y'all, we get large, bee-eeyee-otch 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Hangin' with the honies is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things 
  
 [Verse 2: Too $hort] 
 So now you own a record label, I got one too 
 We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew 
 You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records 
 On the shelf and on the charts the double decker 
 The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me 
 You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook? 
 I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways 
 So I can get paid, everyday 
 I see the same old shit, I see in the streets 
 I know you think I'm sellin' keys but I only sell beats 
 Dopefiend music, it's drug related 
 You can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it 
 It always sounds better when you turn it up loud 
 Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about 
 I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin' niggas 
 It's just like in the streets mane, how much you get? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Hangin' with the honies is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things 
  
 [Verse 3: Too $hort (Jay-Z)] 
 That's right, I been a hustler for a long time 
 Always got the right beats, never sayin' wrong rhymes 
 I started off with nothin' ended up with everything 
 Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane 
 Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm sayin' 
 Always see me at the bank and yes I'm goin' again 
 There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy 
 Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy (that's right) 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get 
 Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect 
 $hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow 
 I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know 
 I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's 
 I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go 
 If you're ballin', keep ballin', if you jealous, stop 
 I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac 
 How real is that? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Hangin' with the honies is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things, check 
  
 [Outro: Too $hort & Jay-Z] 
 Beyotch! $hort Dawg's in the house 
 Jigga 
 Much love 
 $hort Dawg, get your money mane 
 All the way from the West coast 
 Uhh, how real is that[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh-huh uh-huh, UH! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Bounce if you wanna bounce (right), ball if you wanna ball (right) 
 Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, Holla back 
 You can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke 
 Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, yeah yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Beitch.. I need a ho in my life to blow on my dice 
 So we can make our points twice and skate out of town 
 I need that glow in my ice, E-Class 
 Ladies screamin' Jigga you know we needs that, flowin' out like Jees-ass 
 They ain't seein' me holdin' the mic 
 So when you like you find MC's so impolite 
 And me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like 
 Don't me and Jigga be flowin' alike? 
 Nah, not in your life ain't nobody poppin' like 
 Mr. Jay-Z, shit you're crazy 
 I'm hot like the six, navy, deep dish with the gray seats 
 I flow greater than your navigator 
 I drop through your town, block the date up 
 Pimps all comin' through with a hot pair of gators 
 And a crew with, rocks their the size of craters 
 Can't be touched like hot potatoes, ya heard? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Memphis Bleek)] 
 Now we can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball 
 Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back 
 You can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke 
 Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc 
 It's alright (YEAH), you heard? It's alright, holla back 
  
 [Verse 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 In the middle of a war rockin' a vest 
 Who's the illest shorty alive (who?), I confess 
 I take lye to the chest and I swear to the heaven skies, I bless 
 The mics until the day I rest, to make you feel what I feel 
 I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real 
 You can provide the rest 
 Everything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart 
 I'm playing my part, stressed out, just about the best out 
 Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out 
 Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me 
 We extort 'em as soon as they record 'em, Bleek 
 I made this clear, back when shorty used to braid my hair 
 On the project stairs, once I drop to a caesar ma I don't need ya 
 From the block to the hot two-seaters, ya heard? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Memphis Bleek)] 
 Geah, now we can 
 Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball 
 Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back 
 You can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke 
 Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc 
 It's alright (YEAH), you heard? It's alright 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Check, on the jew-els I blew more money than Latrell, who else? 
 They don't know you, think they know you too well 
 You jel like Flubber 
 I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set 
 Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate 
 Mr. I don't cop nothing less than eight 
 And anything involved with my name, regardless of the fame 
 It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again 
 Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express 
 My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress 
 To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya 
 I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear 
 It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife 
 Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths 
 And pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right! 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Now we can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball 
 Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back 
 We can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke 
 Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back 
  
 We can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball 
 Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss 
 It's alright, you heard? It's alright 
 We can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke 
 Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc 
 It's alright, you heard me? It's alright, then holla back[Intro] 
 Yeah Guru 
 Let's have a little fun with this one 
 I got another one 
 Nigga your shit is trash 
 When I see you I'mma beat your ass 
 You better stop playing with me 
 I don't give a fuck about no magazine 
 Don't need radio to do my thing 
 You see me nigga: bling, bling, bling 
 Take it to the bridge 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Your SoundScan going down 
 You better off selling them now 
 Out the trunk, trunk trunk 
 You better stop fucking around 
 You're gon' make me chase your coward ass down 
 With the pump, pump, pump 
  
 [Verse] 
 I came into this game 
 Wanting more paper than Puff 
 Now I realise Puff paper ain't enough 
 Last week Bleek puffed Puff paper up 
 And Beans buy a Bentley every week 
 And I know y'all don't know but G4's ain't cheap 
 And B she got ride G3, nothing less 
 Plus real estate in Miami is highway robbery 
 Wars cost, I need guns for my robberies 
 I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap 
 Don't go too far on that verse 
 Get your whole chest collapsed 
 It's just the facts 
 God bless the cats that think I'm a liar 
 Pick up a paper nigga, read my priors 
 "Just retire!" 
 They screaming from the peanut gallery 
 Not til my salary's like the real Mike Lowry 
 I kill shit 'til I catch Will Smith 
 Then I'm running Spielberg down (yes) 
 Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now 
 Or read about 'em later, nigga 
 You don't even know me and you mad 
 How's it feel to be a hater? 
 Now I know exactly how it feels to be a Laker 
 I'm in power in a Maybach with the missing towers 
 With a keyless ignition, eating Chows 
 A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup 
 I'm in France, I meant Japan 
 What the fuck wrong with you? 
 Everybody wanna know my networth 
 Niggas wake up on my dick—eat some breakfast first 
 I'm a legend, I ain't even left this Earth 
 I'm considered one of the best 'cause I wreck shit the worst 
 I don't care about no vest, when that TEC hit it hurts 
 Spinning that Lexus in reverse 
 Making your next whip a hearse 
 Best to keep it in the verse 
 If it leaks into the street, I won't sleep 
 I'ma creep, 'til I rest one of your peeps 
 And I promise on my Momma, I'm just trying to keep the peace 
 But I'm an outcast, nigga 
 So I gotta keep a piece 
 So when it cock you and shock you, it's a security breach 
 Don't make me reach point break 
 I hit you, Point Blank 
 This ain't a movie dog!

 Pay homage if by chance you meet him 
 In his pants pocket, your advance and per diem 
 It's the undisputed champion 
 For clique, dough sick, no medicine for us 
 Competition like I said in the chorus 
 Let me spell it out for ya 
 Jay to the Amil 
 (A to the Y stay real fuck how they feel, uh-huh, uh-huh) 
 That's how we put it down 
 (Uh-huh, uh-huh y'all gon get it now) 
 Chip off the old block 
 Resemble my old pops 
 'Cept I tote Glocks and open dope spots 
 And I shut down rap crews 
 Smack them cats who flash tools 
 Laugh at fake ballers with bad jewels 
 I'll tell you once 
 This is shit you should've of knew

 No, no, no 
 I'm a Roc-A-fella soldier 
 I thought I told ya 
 Hustler, nigga move weight like Oprah 
 Drive wide body, twenty-inch big motor 
 No tints, make no mistake y'all it's Hova 
 I stay sporting played Jordan's before Jordan 
 Verses tight, hooks harder than Ken Norton 
 Musically touching you 
 Truthfully I abuse beats better call DCW 
 I make my mother move 
 So I have no problem coming around the old way 
 Sluggin' you, that's what a thug will do 
 (Thugging, bust TECs, a suspect dangerous, and I love rough sex) 
 Yeah that's what's up 
 Even when I'm asleep the gats is up 
 Paranoid like Sunny drive backing up 
 But I'm from Bed-Stuy, killer with the flow 
 Let lead fly from out the fo'-fo', motherfuckers 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Amil] 
 S dot Carter 
 Y'all must try harder 
 Competition is 
 Nada! 
 Ladies scream papa 
 Niggas can't stop ya 
 Competition is 
 Nope, nope, nope 
 S dot Carter 
 Y'all must try harder 
 Competition is 
 Nada! 
 Ladies scream papa 
 Niggas can't stop ya 
 Competition is 
 Nope, nope, nope 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Competition is none 
 I remain at the top like the sun 
 And I burn whoever come in my chambers of torture 
 The flame gon' spark ya 
 Blood stain the tarp 
 What remains, they chalk ya 
 Don't try to smooth talk us 
  
 [Verse 4: Amil (Jay-Z)] 
 You got nothing to offer 
 But the baby nine 
 And make ya fine offer 
 The chick is ill 
 Even with four-inch heels 
 No panties on and Patricia Fields 
 I get down 
 Just name the time, the place 
 We could take it back to Vaseline on our face 
 On a regular day we just gleam up your space 
 Rock our own line, got our whole team laced 
 RW with the torch on my jeans by the waist 
 Without heat we still gon steam up the place 
 (Amil-lion, Jigga man, flawless, here we go) 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Amil] 
 S dot Carter 
 Y'all must try harder 
 Competition is 
 Nada! 
 Ladies scream papa 
 Niggas can't stop ya 
 Competition is 
 Nope, nope, nope 
 S dot Carter 
 Y'all must try harder 
 Competition is 
 Nada! 
 Ladies scream papa 
 Niggas can't stop ya 
 Competition is 
 Nope, nope, nope[Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch 
 Skinny nigga toothpick 
 But I do lift weights like I'm using roids 
 Rolls Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering 
 Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in 
 Choices we make trying to escape 
 And I don’t need no hook for this shit 
 This is not for commercial usage 
 Please don’t categorize this as music 
 Please don’t compare me to other rappers 
 Compare me to trappers 
 I’m more Frank Lucas than Ludacris 
 And Luda's my dude 
 I ain't trying to diss 
 Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch 
 I’ma follow the rules no matter how much time I’ma get 
 I’ma live and die with the decisions that I’ma pick 
 So fuck the haven for caving, that’s why we don’t speak 
 Made men ain't supposed to make statements 
 End of the story I followed the code, cracked the safe 
 Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate 
 Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch 
  
 [Refrain: Jay-Z] 
 Hustle hard in, hustle hard in 
 Hustle hard in, hustle hard in 
 Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch 
  
 [Verse 2: Lil' Wayne] 
 Money to be made best believe a niggas glocking 
 I run it myself like a quarterback option 
 I pitch her 10 G's tell the bitch to go shopping 
 She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back the chopper 
 See niggas tryna kick but no I don't play soccer 
 I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker 
 A package on the way you know my whip game proper 
 And off of 1 ki I see 70 thousand dollars 
 Now I will shoot dice, smoking on a joint 
 I bet with your gawdy we hit 5 straight points 
 Yo we kept hustling, yo we kept grinding 
 You rap about money and a nigga might sign ya 
 You rap about me and a nigga might find ya 
 Banana in your ass with your head right behind ya 
 Dope game bitch his momma woulda bought em 
 If you holla at me, a fee 
  
 [Verse 3: Curren$y] 
 Bitches come a dime a dozen 
 I fuck em sisters, cousins 
 It’s a revolving door 
 Pussy going, pussy coming 
 And when they go to you it's coming back to me with money 
 I tell her put them shoes on and keep my paper running 
 I put my mack down just like a G supposed to 
 And if she don’t come home with it then she’s sleeping over 
 I got em creeping over, we do it then a soda 
 I like them Ameriie, you can have them Omarosas 
 Them niggas down below us, baby we up and over 
 I’m trying to get inside that thing that sits between your shoulders 
 I’m talking large totals 
 I’m talking large motors 
 I’m talking burning rubber then melted Pirelli odor 
 I’m hopping out a Lotus, you looking at my bitch 
 You wanna holla, you can holla take her on a trip 
 But when the deed done, you gotta send her back 
  
 [Refrain][Verse] 
 Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game? 
 Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane 
 Duckin' the plain cops, pushin' endo and 'caine 
 At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain 
 First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor 
 Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more 
 Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw 
 Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touchin' the floor 
 And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards 
 T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all 
 Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad 
 He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path 
 A&R's had me feelin' like Moss in the draft 
 So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt 
 Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song 
 I'm the illest nigga doin it 'til y'all prove me wrong 
 Do you believe? 
 It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh..[Intro: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z] 
 Uhh, uhh, uh-huh 
 Uhh, paper chase 
 Bonnie and Clyde 
 Y'all motherfuckers know how it's going down 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 That's right, uhh 
 Uh-huh uh, yeah, right, yeah 
 Paper chase y'all, paper chase WHAT? Uh 
  
 [Verse 1: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z] 
 Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch 
 ‘Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch 
 Half a brick of yay, 'bout to lay down this bitch 
 ('Til November?) Nah, I'm here to like May down this bitch 
 And I'm thinking, I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch 
 Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch 
 I'm trying to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch 
 Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six 
 Roll the windows down and, wave round this bitch 
 But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch 
 Gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here 
 For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters 
 I got jobs for ya, drop Saabs for ya 
 More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya 
 Money propositions hope that's not a prob' for ya 
 If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (that's right!) 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z] 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta have that grab that paper dog! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at? 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones 
 A down ass bitch and she down to click 
 Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with 
 And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich 
 Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit 
 Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch 
 See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit 
 Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit 
 Return later that evening in the club with Fox 
 And I got the snub nose for those that love to box 
 I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block 
 All day, 'til it's light gray outside 
 Shoot dice talking shit all day outside 
 And even when it's hot, they outside 
 Let em know how its gonna go, Bonnie and Clyde 
 And ayo, you would want me on your side 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z] 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta have that grab that paper dog! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at? 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best 
 I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test 
 And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest 
 Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less 
 For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess 
 The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS 
 Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest 
 For my top draft picks I cop the new GS 
 Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team 
 Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream 
 Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things 
 You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens 
 Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things 
 Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between 
 Never feared no man, put four in his bean 
 Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me? 
  
 [Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z] 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta have that grab that paper dog! 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that 
 Gotta get that paper dog 
 When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?[Intro: Jay Z]

 Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me 
 You don't know me nigga, I've done changed

 Yes, yes 
 Brooklyn, stand up! 
 Ugh! Young's in the building! 
 Marcy, what up! 
  
 [Verse 1]: 
 Allow me to re-introduce myself! 
 My name is Hov! H-to-the-O-V 
 I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z 
 I guess even back then, you can call me 
 The CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'! 
 Fresh out the frying pan, into the fire 
 I be the music biz number one supplier 
 Flyer than a piece of paper bearin my name 
 Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain 
 That's right, Hov! 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I ain't done... 
 Check it out 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Real niggas respect it, fake niggas want beef 
 'Cause they know that's the only way we ever gon' speak 
 We never gon' see eye to eye 
 Your type of real, I don't recognize, it's all televised 
 Mobsters opt to, not get in beef 
 There's no business in it, it only brings police 
 Wankstas want beef and they name in the street 
 Most time end up with they brain where they feet should go 
 You should know if you gon' do somethin' 
 And you go to radio, we all know you frontin' 
 They shootin', nobody dyin' 
 Somebody better put somebody body on somebody iron 
 Sometime soon or somebody lyin' 
 I ain't buyin' that shit y'all shovelin' 
 I ain't duckin' for nothin', cousin 
 I'm too tall to act small, you liars

 And make her show out her wild side 
 Stick out her backside) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Now what the fuck they gon' do with me 
 Got money, got broads, got a crew with me 
 Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me 
 Get down or lay down nigga to shoot with me 
 Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me 
 I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me 
 Got the whole BK ready to kill with me 
 You scared motherfucker, keep it real with me, keep it real with me 
 Now what the fuck they gon say to me 
 Got to clap, yi mean all day with me, CLAP, yi mean 
 Don't play with me, CLAP, yi mean 
 Stay with me, don't lose me y'all 
 And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different 
 I bought it back for a living 
 33 O's on a bitch back like Pippen 
 3 She can keep for herself and distribute 
 36 O's in ki, you do the addition 
 Before Mitchell and Ness did it 
 I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted 
 I'm Cal Ripken Jr., let's get it

 Hon' what they gon' say to you 
 Got your hair did and your favorite shoes 
 Tell 'em don't play with you, get 'em away from you 
 You need a baller like I, call 'em like I 
 See 'em like naaaah 
 Move over y'all amateurs 
 No, you not balling that's Pro-Am shit 
 Oh, stop calling that's ho-man shit 
 Stop falling asleep that's old man shit 
 I stands up in it like a champ up in it 
 Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it 
 No more minute man in it 
 Get my Soundscan, BDS, and Market at Glance in it

 What they gon do' 
 You got starch in your flow 
 I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow 
 All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilke 
 I am art with the flow 
 Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow 
 Niggas taking me lightly, had to darken the flow 
 Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow 
 I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow 
 Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow 
 I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow 
 Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow 
 In some places they say this, I am God with the flow 
 Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow 
 (Although) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow 
 Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow 
 I come up hard but I evolve with the flow 
 Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow

 Bonsoir, muh'fuckas!... We back... 
 As if we never left this bitch... on top... it's worldwide... 
 Still Just Blaze'in this shit up... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Every place I visit, I got land there 
 How could niggas stand there 
 Say I sound like them? Hell no 
 Push wigs back, push Bentley drops that's yellow 
 Started from the elbow, nigga, from the get-go 
 No, not the Geico, ain't nothing accidental 
 Just the facts that I've been through 
 Perhaps if you was into 
 Half of the shit I've been through 
 That'd make your pen move 
 Your mind would open, your heart would bleed 
 Instead y'all niggas flow oh so retardedly 
 You sound retarded to me! 
 How could you stand there, pants near down to your ass, you wanna spar with me 
 I'll put you down in the grass, it's the God MC, Young V-I-T-O 
 Young'n, you are my hijo 
 My son dula 
 I clean the cesspool up 
 Rap stinks 
 You cats are the Sphinx 
 You cut off your nose to spite your face 
 Bet you like it that way don'tchya? 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Don't you know? 
 When you're defeated, young punk? 
 Won't you throw 
 Won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth 
 Don't you know that we know you're just running your mouth 
 Cause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house 
 Don't you know 
 When you're defeated, young punk? 
 Won't you throw? 
 Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels 
 My vocabulary murders the dictionary 
 Flow switches every 16, shits mean, man 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Shit, I'm heavy in the game 
 I ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Last man standing 
 Blam-blamming the cannon 
 48 Hours, it's Reggie Hammond 
 The colte, Nick Nolte 
 My demeanor is Humphrey Bogie 
 Baby, I'm comfy, cozy, my spot is solidified 
 Roc-a-bye baby, I sing you a lullabye 
 How ill am I? BK to Philladi- 
 Delphia! Niggas feelin how real am I 
 Shit, I carry two Taurus, niggas they call me Gemini 
 Though my birthday is one day before December 5 
 It's S Carter, the archer, I throw darts at ya 
 Arrows through your apparel, I will dearly depart ya 
 It's clearly hard for ya, what God has bestowed on me 
 You nah destroys me nigga; nigga I'm poetry 
 In four part harmony, it's like Jodeci 
 Check out my melody, my flow is a felony 
 Oh, I'm so seventies, I'm in tune with the heavenly 
 Governing body - Check, check, check out my destiny 
 I walk leaving four footprints 
 My hood sense 
 My book smarts 
 My faith of the unknown 
 And a good heart 
 What's seldom shown is the good part 
 Like I said 
 Try to bring 'em life, but they want dead 
 You won't listen 
 Hov' is a nice guy, but you don't miss him 
 That'll piss him off quick, you won't listen 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Don't you know? 
 When you're defeated, young punk? 
 Won't you throw 
 Won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth 
 Don't you know that we know you're just running your mouth 
 Cause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house 
 Don't you know 
 When you're defeated, young punk? 
 Won't you throw? 
 Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels 
 My vocabulary murders the dictionary 
 Flow switches every 16, shits mean, man[Intro: Louis Farrakhan] 
 And out of the mercy of Allah and the law written in our nature 
 We call an individual into existence, and when that individual comes 
 I make no apologies for what I'm about to do... 
  
 [Verse: Jay-Z] 
 I'm America's worst nightmare 
 I'm young, black, and holdin' my nuts like "Geah!" 
 Y'all was in the pub, havin' a light beer 
 I was at the club, havin' a fight there 
 Y'all can go home, husband and wife there 
 My momma at work tryin' to buy me the right gear 
 Nine years old, uncle lost his life here 
 I grew up thinkin' life ain't fair 
 How can I get a real job, China white right there 
 Right in front of my sight like, "Here, yeah 
 There's ya ticket out the ghetto, take flight right here 
 Sell me you go bye-bye here." Damn 
 There's a different set of rules we abide by here 
 You need a gun, niggas might drive by here 
 Y'all havin' fun, racin' all ya hot-rods there 
 Downloadin' all our music on ya iPods there 
 I'm Chuck-D, standin' in the crosshairs here 
 Y'all straight, chicks got horse hair here 
 Y'all ain't gotta be in fear of y'all bosses there 
 You lose your job, your pop rich, y'all don't care 
 So I don't care, y'all actin' like y'all don't hear 
 All the screams from the ghetto, all the teens duckin' metal here 
 So they steam like a kettle here 
 Tryin' to take they mind to a whole different level here 
 Yeah, we real close to devil here 
 Gotta be a better way somebody call a reverend here 
 Yeah, y'all must really be in heaven there 
 Somebody tell God that we got a couple questions here 
 My little cuz never got to see his seventh year 
 And I'm so used to pain, that I ain't even shed a tear[Chorus: Usher & Pharrell] 
 Anything you want girl 
 I'll bet you never seen it like this 
 Just stay up on that floor girl 
 And I'll grant all your wishes 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know 
 Especially when you bounce, bounce 
 I really like it when you bounce, bounce 
 I see money when you bounce, bounce 
 Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Ooh you so nasty, amateur pole dancing 
 Come and get this cash from me, they call me Rain Man 
 She tried to rain dance, money so long it'll drown you girl 
 Buried under so much stacks 
 They had to pull back about 50 thou before they found ya girl 
 I brought book bags of that bankroll, I'm a D-boy, baby they know 
 I'm an original D-boy, they go bankrupt if they try to keep up 
 No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling 
 I'll spread bread on the bed, ever had sex on a million? 
 Tell me 
  
 [Chorus: Usher & Pharrell] 
 Anything you want girl 
 I'll bet you never seen it like this 
 Just stay up on that floor girl 
 And I'll grant all your wishes 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot) 
 You know, you know, you know 
 Especially when you bounce, bounce 
 I really like it when you bounce, bounce 
 I see money when you bounce, bounce

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Red light, TLC 
 Through the left eye, my POV 
 On the iChat 
 How's that for computer love? She rolled her eyes back 
 I'm like, "Ooh you're so nasty" 
 You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris 
 I ain't gotta go down to the go-go 
 You got a private show that's like Magic City 
 I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds 
 Let's role play, act like you want it 
 You know, you know you hot like fire 
 You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars 
 But not them 1's and not no 5's 
 Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland? 
 That's a thousand dollar bill, baby 
  
 [Chorus: Usher & Pharrell] 
 Anything you want girl

 Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 You know, you know, you hot like fire 
 As I blow, some dough, you might could retire 
 Take it slow like Neo, when shots was fired 
 In the Matrix have patience, got lots of bottles 
 Rock-a-bye baby Jay-Z got notes like Mariah 
 Got no 1's got no 5's, my D notes are higher 
 I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter 
 Than Nicole Richie, roll with me, they on a diet baby 
  
 [Chorus: Usher & Pharrell] 
 Anything you want girl 
 I'll bet you never seen it like this 
 Just stay up on that floor girl 
 And I'll grant all your wishes 
 You know, you know, you know (you hot)

 [Jay talking to Funkmaster Flex]: 
 Can I keep goin'? I wrote... Can I keep goin'? 
 Do not put my verse on y'all records dawg! 
 {Laughing} 
  
 The boy trap money like bear hunters 
 Dear Summer, I know y'all gonna miss me 
 For we been together like Nike Air's and crisp T's 
 S. Dot's and Polo fleece's 
 Purple label shit with the logo secret 
 Gimme a couple of years, shhh, I might just sneak in 
 A couple of words and like Peaches & Herb 
 We'll be reunited and it feel so hood 
 Got the whole world sayin' "How he still so good?" 
 Well I do this in my slumbers, Summer 
 I ain't none of these half-assed new comers, you know how I do Summer 
 I drop heat when you bring the sun up 
 The combo make niggas act up I pick the gun up 
 Niggas back up they know I ain't no fronter 
 I don't talk shit I just flip and "Un" ya 
 Sorry Lance I'm just tryna advance my quotes 
 I ain't makin' you the butt of my jokes 
 Let's not stray from what I came to say 
 To my beloved, I think we need some time away 
 They say if you love it 
 You should let it out the cage, if not fuck it 
 If it comes back you should know it's there to stay 
 It's tuggin, at my heart but this time apart is needed 
 From the public, should've gave me the Pulitz' 
 But instead gave me they ass to kiss 
 But you know me, thugging till the casket dips 
 But still shine light down on all my peers 
 I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share 
 In all the success I receive, I know you can't believe 
 I still love 'em but they don't love me 
 They like the drunk uncle in ya 
 {Laughing} 
 Though they lame it's still the same still you love 'em the same 
 Like when cats make subliminal records 
 Know they can't directly direct it at me I don't respect it 
 And you don't really want it with Hov for the record 
 I put a couple of careers on hold - you could be next kid 
 You keep entering the danger zone 
 You gonna make that boy Hov put your name on a song 
 If you that hungry for fame cocksucker, c'mon! 
 Say when, take ten paces and spin 
 But on another note I'm bout to take another va-cay on another boat 
 Goddamn a motherfucker rode his way out the hood 
 And I pray that I stay out for good 
 But any day you know a nigga could try to play like he Suge 
 Then I gotta pull it like Dutch Schultz 
 You pass the Dutchy I'll blast you trust me 
 Niggas can't fuck with me 
 I'm in a good mood y'all lucky 
 I'm in a good groove 
 And I ain't tryin to mess my thing up 
 But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up 
 Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt 4-fifth and 
 Young niggas that blasphemy, blast for me, no religion 
  
 [Jay talking:] 
 Yo, I'mma stop Flex, I don't want nobody to catch feelings 
 I had to take off the blazer, loosen up the tie 
 Step inside the booth, Superman is alive 
 {Laughing}[Bill Maher] 
 I very often think about you and the Beatles, not because the music sounds alike, but because they were real envelope-pushers, you know, they were always about what's next, telling the audience. They were not afraid to be ahead of their audience, and I feel like that's what you try to do. I mean, this album is a lot about arts, and things that kids not necessarily would be interested in. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 The the truth is, as far as hip-hop and the arts, we were like cousins, you know. If you think about those days with Fab Five Freddy was with Madonna and Basquiat and everything. You know, we all went to those clubs--that’s when hip hop was more underground. The arts and hip-hop really partied together, but when arts started becoming part of the gallery it was this separation. But we pretty much came up together. 
  
 [Maher] 
 You have a song on your record called “Tom Ford.” I'm sure some people are thinking, why is he on some white, gay designer’s dick? What’s going on there? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Pause. 
  
 Let me clarify that: I am not...[Laughs] 
  
 [Maher] 
 I meant that metaphorically. But the line that I think says alot, you say, “I don’t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford.” You know, everybody else is talking about doing ecstasy, and you’re, “I don’t do that; I get shit done. I’m in business.” 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Man, I’m just gonna take you around with me-- 
  
 [Maher] 
 To explain your shit? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, sir. 
  
 [Maher] 
 It could help you with Harry Belafonte. You had a feud. Show the picture. I mean, this is very bad what happened with the you and Harry because, I mean, look at look at this. He’s 86, and you’re 43? So he’s literally twice your age and it’s a draw. 
  
 He got on your case because he, I remember when they did this with Michael Jordan, you remember that, when they were saying to Michael Jordan: “You're the king of the negroes; get more involved, do more.” And, you know, that upset you, and I don't blame you for being upset. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Yeah, I just didn’t think it was the correct venue. If it was something, really like a real problem, you know, I'm not a very difficult to find, especially for someone of that stature. He can reach out to me and we can have a conversation we’ll do some good together. But, you know, I just thought that it was a bit of grandstanding to me, and I didn’t appreciate especially dragging my wife into it was a bit of a low blow-- 
  
 [Maher] 
 And Bruce Springsteen... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I really like Bruce Springsteen. 
  
 [Maher] 
 Harry was on our show once. He was iconic, as he is, and I don't know if you ever saw this clip, but I wanted to get it for you. This is from a 1968 television special he did with Petula Clark, and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched him. Show the clip to show you what I'm talking about. This is what people we upset about. 
  
 Can you imagine, that’s where the country was? That just that she had his arm...and you see the look in his eyes, it's like, “you know, you dumb English broad, you’re gonna get me lynched." I’m just putting it in perspective; that’s where he’s coming from. 
  
 I feel like a lot of this record is about the love/hate relationship you have with fame, certainly that first track, the title track. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 “Holy Grail,” it’s about acknowledging that you’re dancing with this drug, you know, and that people have lost their lives behind it, you know, this fame thing, and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense of yourself within it. We look at all the people that came before us who are no longer here with us, you know, have been in this dance with fame. And it’s just me just really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it in some ways. It’s sorta like my therapy. 
  
 It’s kinda strange to have a conversation with like three people, like I'm ignoring y’all. I gotta make eye contact. 
  
 [Maher] 
 And they’re all gay, by the way. 
  
 [Barney Frank] 
 Think of us as your backup group in waiting. 
  
 [Maher] 
 We’ll bring them in in a few minutes. You’re the first guest we’ve ever had who said that. Everyone else is like, “Fuck them.” They never even think about that. 
  
 Okay, so I was doing a little math and based on when your first album came out, you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in seven years. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Is it based on your first album? 
  
 [Maher] 
 Twenty five years from your first album. So in seven years you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm sure you'll be getting in first ballot unless there's some steroids-- 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I am not going! 
  
 [Maher] 
 You’re not going? 
  
 [Jay] 
 Nah, I’m just-- 
  
 [Maher] 
 You’ll be going. Who would you like to induct you? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Um, Obama. 
  
 [Maher] 
 Well... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I cheated. 
  
 [Maher] 
 Let’s say he’s busy... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 It’ll be all right. He owes me, he owes me a couple. 
  
 [Maher] 
 He owes me a couple. 
  
 [...] 
  
 [Bill Maher] 
 I noticed that one of the talking points from conservatives after the Trayvon Martin trial was, why are we talking about this one tragedy when hundreds of black kids are being shot in Chicago. But over the weekend the Congressional Black Caucus did a two-day summit there, and they talked about this very issue the conservatives say they're never talking about. It was covered by NPR, MSNBC, Chicago media, C-SPAN, not Fox News. It seems like Fox News doesn't want to allow this fact in that they are actually talk-- 
  
 [Josh Barro] 
 It’s total concern trolling. 
  
 [Maher] 
 What? 
  
 [Barro] 
 Concern trolling. It's, you know, saying, well you know shouldn't--don't worry about this thing, worry about this other thing, but you don't really care about the other thing you just wanna change the subject. 
  
 And I think that the it's also bizarre to act like people don't care about violence in in inner cities or affecting black communities in the United States. I think it's a hugely important issue, especially in local politics where crime issues are actually dealt with. But it really it really is just an effort to change the subject. 
  
 [Barney Frank] 
 It's also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in America. And social workers, and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. And also, by the way, that’s why unemployment is too high; we've created on a private sector jobs, but the Republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs, and that’s cops and others. So they’ve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem. 
  
 [Alexis Goldstein] 
 But I think over-policing is part of the problem. I mean, look at New York City and look at stop and frisk. I mean, policing in communities of color...I mean, I don't know, I can’t talk this better than you can, but I’m curious or your opinion, Jay Z-- 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I don’t really want to scare America, but the did the real problem is there's no middle class, right? So that the gap between have and have-nots is getting wider and wider. 
  
 [Applause] 
  
 Let me just finish this point because I do want to scare them a little bit: It's going to be a problem that no amount of police can solve, because, you know, once you have that sort of oppression, you know, and that gap is widening, it’s inevitable that something is going to happen. 
  
 [Frank] 
 I agree with that, but that does not mean you don't need police in the short term, and I completely disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people’s rights, but the African Americans I talk to, and that including those in Congress, don't want fewer police--they want better policing. But they want more policing. It’s like Bill said, “Oh, the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. So denying them the resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. I don't know any significant percentage in the African-American community... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Well, more jobs would be better than police. We won’t need police... 
  
 [Frank] 
 You need them both. I think, again, that’s a mistake. More jobs, those are going to help, but in the short term people want police stations. We are very unfair to people live in public housing. It was built badly, and they were put in there, but they deserve much more protection. The overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent, honest people-- 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 They deserve to get out of there. Public housing was a temporary stop, right? 
  
 I grew up in Marcy Projects; public housing was a temporary stop until you got yourself together, you moved on. 
  
 [Frank] 
 But even if you’re there for a couple years, you don’t want to be unpoliced. I'm all for that, low-income affordable rental housing was my number one goal--it's another thing that the Republicans, through the Tea Party, have absolutely cut off, unfortunately-- 
  
 [Goldstein] 
 But I don’t think Stop-and-Frisk is a few bad apples. That’s an institutionalized racism that the NYPD has been conducting for years. They stopped more young black men than there are young black men in New York last year. I don’t seem them stopping and frisking Wall Street bankers--they have tons of cocaine on them. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Hahahahaha. 
  
 [Frank] 
 You’re fighting a straw man. Of course Stop-and-Frisk, the way they’re doing it, is wrong, but answer is not fewer police. You hear people in the African-American community in New York complaining about Stop-and-Frisk, not get the cops outta here. They want the cops to be there and to be better behaved. 
  
 [Barro] 
 I think it's also important to remember: crime is still falling. We've had a massive improvement-- 
  
 [Maher] 
 The murder rate is at a hundred year low. 
  
 [Barro] 
 Yeah, so I think you know inequality’s a big problem in a number of ways, but a lot of people were afraid when we went to the recession in 2008 that the progress we’d made on crime be reversed, and actually this is one social indicator that just keeps getting better. 
  
 [Frank] 
 And also black people are the primary victims of crime disproportionately, and that’s why they don’t want to see the police taken away. They want them improved but the answer is not to remove them. 
  
 [Maher] 
 If the murder rate is at a hundred year low, why do we need to do so much stopping and frisking; why do we need drones with the police department; why we're building a wall in Mexico. It begs a lot of questions. Why are we such a police state now? 
  
 [Frank] 
 Don't punish every city in New York for Mike Bloomberg's tics. The fact is-- 
  
 [Goldstein] 
 And Ray Kelly’s, let’s don’t forget about Ray Kelly. 
  
 [Maher] 
 Obama wants him as the Homeland Security Czar. 
  
 [Frank] 
 It is not true in the whole country that police departments are doing that. The Los Angeles police have gotten a lot better since the days of-- 
  
 [Maher] 
 But you’re from Massachusetts. We saw, when the Douchebag Brothers blew up the parade, somehow Boston had an army. 
  
 [Barro] 
 It was really weird: they shut down the whole city for a day. 
  
 [Maher] 
 And they had half-tracks and what looked like tanks. It didn't look like a police department that I ever saw. 
  
 [Goldstein] 
 We are an increasingly militarized society, and because these budgets are getting bigger and bigger, they need to justify those budgets. So sometimes you need to find crime-- 
  
 [Frank] 
 Local police budgets are not getting bigger; they're being shrunk. If you work at the local level, if you work with police chiefs, and the people want the services from the police. Yes, you got to make them better, but in Los Angeles-- 
  
 [Goldstein] 
 But we didn’t want the police at Occupy Wall Street, I’ll tell you that. 
  
 [Frank] 
 But you were not victims of crime. 
  
 [Goldstein] 
 We were victims of brutality. There’s 125-page report that's put together by NYU law professors, documenting all the First Amendment violations conducted by the NYPD.[Intro: Jay-Z & Rell]

 It's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade 
 All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight 
 Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see) 
 As you thumb through The Source, I read the Robb Report 
 Class C, cold me down with the plastic 
 That's all I ask of you, like Raphael Saadiq 
 At the Hotel Nikko, Robert Duvall suite 
 My people's eyes through the peep hole 
 I'm loving you down freak, as I 
 Shoot through the city like a rumor 
 Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading 
 The newspaper heading read "Jay-Z breathes, 80 degrees 
 Only thing to cool him off is a Malibu Bay Breeze" 
 Can't stop for the Feds, say cheese 
 You know they wanna take a nigga picture 
 Pray for the day to get ya, but I'ma parlay, stay richer for now 
 Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while 
 You know my stomach's getting weak from living on the streets 
 For real, I'm trying to oversee it from suites, ordering eats 
 At the top where the real criminal minds meet 
 That's where the cream is (right?!) 
 That's where your dream is (well ain't it?)

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z & Irv Gotti] 
 Yeah, ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, ha 
 I used to speed excessive, both eyes closed 
 No thought infested 
 Hitting pot holes, cop-o's'll snatch your away 
 What you deem most precious 
 Had to rethink things, is pinky rings worth 
 Life on the run and time served in Sing Sing? 
 I don't know to tell the truth, if I'm pressed for dough 
 Gotta consult Irv Gotti y'all, heads got to roll 
 I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive 
 If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd 
 What you're facing is official (it's official) 
 In most cases when I'm blazing won't miss you (won't miss you) 
 Case and point made bullshit a issue, I see it to the end 
 My writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen 
 Make no mistake about me 
 It's only one nigga living, I got half a cake about me 
 I got love, I can kill a friend over fam not drugs 
 And very, few people understand that love 
 To make a nigga die bleeding is nothing (nothing) 
 You make a motherfucker die breathing 
 Then you saying something, beeotch

 You're only a customer (uh)

 Roc-A-Fella... 
 More flavor than y'all can image having 
 Graphic like Sega Saturn, traffic like the Bodega 
 It just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dirt 
 Brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life 
 Fuck it, greasy I, had the whole D.C. high 
 Pissy off Cristal, 3G high 
 Seasoned Bacardi, VVS's 
 Blesses my body, we be fresh at the party 
 Play yourself go 'head if you don't know the ledge 
 It's like spitting to God 
 Get it in your face fucking with niggas over your head 
 Take your time with me, shifty 
 Used to make coke stretch like a sample in a 950 
 Shit with that, while I'm on a Kawasaki bike 
 At the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back 
 And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype 
 In 35 slow-mo, with the Roc-A-Fella logo 
 Accapoco to Aruba, Bay Breezes and caviar beluga 
 Very little loot eludes us 
 In the grayish blueish L-e-x coupe 
 It's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?

 Young! 
  
 If you with me, throw the diamond up one time 
 Ladies, if you with me, just grind to the bass line 
 Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind 
 And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside 
  
 Now what the fuck they gon' do with me 
 Got money, got broads, got a crew with me 
 Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me 
 Get down or lay down nigga to shoot with me 
 Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me 
 I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me 
 Got the whole BK ready to kill with me 
 You scared motherfucker, keep it real with me, keep it real with me 
 Now what the fuck they gon say to me 
 Got to clap, yi mean all day with me, CLAP, yi mean 
 Don't play with me, CLAP, yi mean 
 Stay with me, don't lose me y'all 
 And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different 
 I bought it back for a living 
 33 O's on a bitch back like Pippen 
 3 She can keep for herself and distribute 
 36 O's and a key, you do the addition 
 Before Mitchell and Ness did it 
 I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted 
 I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Hon' what they gon' say to you 
 Got your hair did and your favorite shoes 
 Tell'em don't play with you, get'em away from you 
 You need a baller like I, call'em like I 
 See'em like naaaa 
 Move over y'all amateurs 
 No, you not balling that's Pro-Am shit 
 Oh, stop calling that's ho-man shit 
 Stop falling asleep that's old man shit 
 I stands up in it like a champ up in it 
 Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it 
 No more minute man in it 
 Get my Soundscan, BDS, and Marketing plans in it 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 What they gon do' 
 You got starch in your flow 
 I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow 
 All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilke 
 I am art with the flow 
 Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow 
 Niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow 
 Way I put it together, tear'em apart with the flow 
 I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow 
 Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow 
 I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow 
 Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow 
 In some places they say this, I am God with the flow 
 Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow 
 (Oh no) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow 
 Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow 
 I come up hard but I evolve with the flow 
 Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow 
  
 [Hook][Verse:] 
 You got starch in your flow 
 I flow too many ways 
 Got an arch in my flow 
 All songs are flow 
 Rembrandt, Rilke

 Niggas takin' me lightly 
 Had to darken the flow

 Tear 'em apart with the flow 
 I'm too smart with the flow 
 You just started to flow 
 Stop it youngin'

 [Hook 1: Lord Tariq] 
 People know me on these streets player, I ain't new 
 Lookin at me all funny, while I'm countin my money 
 Suprise, what I do is already legalized 
 Analyze what I toss across, ain't no love lost 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Fo' sure, everythings for dough now 
 Flow, you gotta pay a little more now 
 It's platinum, now a days we put the gold down 
 We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown 
 Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bezel out 
 Y'all don't like it? Sue me, fuck I'll settle out 
 Ghetto'd out in the vehicle Bent 
 These days I mellowed out, see success make a fella content 
 Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Papi Chulo 
 Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player 
 I know you rappers wanna see me fail 
 But quick to see a 600SEL V-12 
 Live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it 
 I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine 
 Your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie 
 Seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me 
 Bottom line 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z] 
 People know me on these streets and the towns I been through 
 Lookin at me, stay focused, I'm givin em straight poker suprise 
 What I do is already legalized 
 Analyze how I floss of course, ain't no love lost 
  
 [Verse 2: Lord Tariq] 
 We be the Bronx to BK'lyn, togethor we about a ton or better 
 On the way in, we rhyme related, very underestimated 
 That's why I'm winnin in this world of sins 
 Steady grinnin, money boss spendin 
 Distant from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influencial 
 Spiritualy and mental, what you into I done been through 
 Preachin my words and don't know what you owe 
 It shows you wanna be me, but won't show it 
 Ain't nothin changed, but players, the game remains the same 
 I had a ten year run, hey I can't complain 
 Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi 
 From the bx weed, ridin the south beach on jet-ski 
 Play to survive, you ain't live you just livin 
 You breathin a good one, but where I'm from, y'all forbidden 
 Come around, bad decision, you rather be in prison 
 Ain't' no duckin what I'm deliverin won't be forgivin in 
 Layin there shiverin, half the night 
 You gotta walk toward the light, everything is aiight 
 I make sure everything you endure stays tight 
 Big (*boom*) Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, outta sight 
  
 [Hook 1] 
  
 [Verse 3: Nas] 
 I spend nights on corners, see the crack, cop my first Mac 
 No longer scared to pump what y'all pump, now I burst back 
 It hurts that, don't seem C.R.E.A.M can make my purse fat 
 Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the hearst black 
 But curse that, tryin to see Nas was your worst match 
 Blowin like Tahitii, throw off NYPD 
 Am I greedy? Like Amin Idi see me 
 In a fly Salinii gimme frames and the beanie 
 I flip my loot twice a week on the most trifest streets 
 You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep 
 Ain't no love lost, none taken, none givin' 
 Stressin how I'm livin it, thinkin when my loot first came 
 Look what I did with it, bought my click glaciers 
 And pagers, rollin ten deep to Las Vegas 
 Copped a live croc, chopped it up, hit my block off 
 Wit gators, feedin peoples, from the bridge to Dequatas 
 But now, two years five months and 30 days later 
 I still put out the street flavor 
 But watch that kid right there, a bulge in his night wear 
 Awoke me up the ways I used to be in my heist years 
 Bubble eye small fry loaded four five 
 Just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by 
 Now that I can see the 360, now that its me thats jiggy 
 Them cooly heads they wanna stick me, whoa[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Sauce motherfuckin', Jigga, Jigga, feel this... 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money]

 [Verse 3: Jay-Z & Sauce Money] 
 (Can I touch that?) What's that? Leave it for dead 
 Keep ya arm over ya face my nigga (keep ya head) 
 Keep a mind to survive if ya sleep ya dead 
 Stay fly 'til ya die nigga deep with prayer 
 With each word ya say I guess the beef is dead 
 Ladies & gentlemen (like impeach the Prez)

 Broad day like De Niro shoot all day 
 I'm the man fuckin' the tracks and you just foreplay 
 Get a hit I, I come through, blow up, you spit out 
 What up? Keep it cocked faithfully like salop 
 With one in the drop don't get hit up 
 (I be the 4-5th flamer) and (hoes bitch shamer) what! 
 Clap cats, a snitch'll give ya whole click name up 
 Look I done came up (and) tore a whole game up (right) 
 Meet me in the square with one in the chamber 
 The face off, nigga 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money] 
 This goes out to my Brooklyn crew 
 Put ya guns up in the air if ya feel me 
 (If ya feel me) Fuck 'em all day fuck 'em all night

 This goes out... put ya guns up in the air 
 If ya feel me 
 Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night 
 We don't love these hoes 
 Yeah! 
 This goes out (to my Brooklyn crew)[Elliot Wilson] 
 When somebody like Harry Belafonte makes a comment, you get offended by that. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I’m offended by that because, first of all, and this is gonna sound arrogant, but my presence is charity, just who I am, just like Obama’s is, Obama provides hope, whether he does anything, the hope that he provides for a nation, and outside of America, is enough. Know what I’m saying? Just being who he is. He’s the first Black president. If he speaks on any issue or anything, he should be left alone. I’m not gonna say anything bad about him. Of course, we’re gonna challenge him to do better, but I felt that Belafonte just went about it wrong, the way he did it in the media and then bigged up Bruce Springsteen or somebody, and it was like, whoa, you just sent the wrong message all the way around. You know what I’m saying? You bigged up--Bruce Springsteen is a great guy, you know what I mean?--you a civil rights activist and you just bigged up the white guy against me in the white media. And I’m not saying that in a racial way, I’m just saying what is, the facts of what it was. And it was like, that was the wrong way to go about it. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 Today, President Obama made a statement about Trayvon Martin... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Amazing, amazing, amazing. Because it’s hard in politics to really just make a statement as a human. I felt today he was very admirable because he made a statement as a father and as a black man and as someone who had compassion for the things that we go through because he’s been through it before. It’s certainly not normal. You know, a politician is not supposed to speak like that. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 He went out of his way to address it... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 No, not address it; he really gave facts about clutching purses. We’ve never heard that! We never heard that come out of a president’s mouth. You know, so, that was big, really admirable. I really have another level of respect for him, to be in that position and make that stance, because that’s what I want to do, I want to be in this position and still talk about what’s right and wrong. I’m not gonna always be right; I’m not gonna always do the right thing. But I’m trying. That’s my whole goal, is to maintain a sense of myself and also I want to represent us. I want to represent us in a way we’ve never been represented before. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 What are your thoughts on Trayvon? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I was really angry. I didn’t sleep for two days. I was really angry about it. We all knew there was still a bit of racism in America, but for it to be so blatant was… if you just asked the questions, asked yourself the question, ‘Didn’t Trayvon have a right to stand his ground?’ He was being chased, he was being chased and he fought back. He might’ve won, that doesn’t mean he’s a criminal. he won. If you chase me, and you try to attack me, and I defend myself, how can I be in the wrong? This guy went to get Skittles and go back and watch the All-Star Game. He had plans. Get an Arizona and get the skittles and watch the game. You know, he probably had his whole position...he had no intentions of robbing anyone's home. You know? So, it's just a thing where, again, a reminder that we still have a long way to go. It's beautiful now, because this generation, they don't see color in that way. We're a bit removed from those racist feelings because, again, it's hard to teach racism when your child is out...you know, our clubs is integrated, the music we listen to is the same. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 ..went to the Jay Z/JT show. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Exactly. All our feelings and all our anxieties are more similar now, so you have hope that this generation don't see racism that way, but you still see the old guard, the whole thing that I'm fighting against, that old guard and their old ideas and their stubborn ways and all their ego and all that bullshit. It's still there and it still exists, you know, and you just hate to believe that even a part of it has got to be about business. You know, they're funding George Zimmerman because people want to hold onto their guns, so the NRA is like...you just start...you're mind can go so many places, why the verdict came down the way it came down and we all know it was wrong. It was wrong, this guy was not a professional. First of all, you're not a professional to profile someone. I'm a professional, law enforcement officer, and I'm taught not to profile. This guy's a novice, this guy's a fucking mall cop. You can't assess the situation and figure out what you're going to do, that's not what you do for a living. And even the law, that Stand Your Ground law, you can have a fight with someone, and if they're running away, you can shoot them and kill them, and you're fine? That's not...can we...what?? Let's say...come on...come on man. Someone's robbing your house and they leave and you can shoot them on the way out? They don't possess a threat to you at that point. How? How is that self-defense? 
  
 [Wilson] 
 Yea. I know you dedicated "Forever Young" at the shows to him, and stuff like that. The Trayvon situation. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Yeah because his memory will live on, right, it'll be...hopefully it'll be...of course, you feel horrible for his parents, that they had to lose their kid, but hopefully this is the moment that changed that law and changed the way we interact with each other. You hate that a child had to be sacrificed for that. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 When you made "Fuck Up The World", I know you watch CNN, it was a rebellion act that you saw that kind of inspired that. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Yeah the Arab Spring and everybody, how they were standing up and speaking for themselves all around the world, you know, Egypt and whether right or wrong, people now have this platform to say, "we're not going to allow your politics to get in the way with the way people feel and how the people should be represented." 
  
 [Wilson] 
 It's funny cause they say how personal Magna Carta Holy Grail is, but you could call it political in a lot of senses. Like, that song "Somewhereinamerica", you could take the catchphrase of Miley Cyrus twerking and that's catchy, but it's humor and wit, with a deeper message behind it. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Yes, and that's the thing, like reviews...think about trying to get that line. You hear that Miley Cyrus, you're going to come to the wrong conclusion that you really understand the story. People are like, "why's he saying 'Miley Cyrus' in the song?" Don't you understand? It's hard to understand the intention behind it. Again, it uses wit and it's catchy, but the real story is about racism. The whole song is, somewhere in America, you can't teach racism when your child is connected to the culture. It's very hard to... 
  
 [Wilson] 
 She could be any white girl in middle-America. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Exactly. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 Learning a black dance, or a Hip Hop dance. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Right 
  
 [Wilson] 
 "Jay Z Blue" obviously...you made "Glory" right after you had your child, and that seemed like.."Glory", the title itself is a very positive kind of glorious thing, and then you look at "Jay Z Blue" and there's a very dark vibe to it. The "Mommie Dearest" sample [incoherent], why do you feel like you wanted that type of song to represent that? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 If you think about the timing, it's life, right? When your baby first comes, it's only joy. It's only joy, it's like, "oh my god, look at this." It's fascinating that two people can create a life, "this is real," and you know, so it's only glory. It's all joy. Then after that kicks in, you sit with yourself, like, "am I going to be a good dad?" I know I have the DNA of my dad, and I know it's not just me and my dad. This is an ongoing problem within our community, how do I get around it? So all those fears and all those anxieties start setting in. I mean, if you intend to do it the right way, the correct way, then you got to really think about it. So those first days was glorious, it was all joy, and now I have to really do the work and make sure I don't repeat that cycle, because I do have my father's DNA, and I'm sure he didn't set out to leave. Actually, he married my mom. It wasn't like he just left day one, he married my mom. He tried, you know? Just, life got in the way. His brother got killed, drugs got into play, so all these things got into play that he couldn't see, nine years out, what was going to happen in life. I'm sure he went into it with the best intentions, the same we all do, and it didn't work out. I don't want that to happen, so let me talk about it. Let me deal with these feelings, let me deal with these emotions, and let me work on it. Let me work it out. So "Jay Z Blue" is pretty much that, "father never taught me how to be a father/treat a mother/I don't want to have to just repeat another/leave another." You know, that's the story in a nutshell. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 What's the statement on you putting "On The Run (Pt. II)" on the album? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Besides it being really dope?...[laughter]...Again, it's just a showcase of...there's very few relationships in Hip Hop music. There's a lot of, "I took your girl, and I'm gonna take her again,"..[cross-talk]..You know what I'm saying? I don't know if people are properly absorbing what I'm doing here. Like I don't know, in the context of... 
  
 [Wilson] 
 Making marriage cool in some sense. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Just being honest about it, and putting those sort of subject matters in Hip Hop records. You know? That's not normal. 
  
 [Wilson] 
 A record like "On The Run"? We wouldn't have got that 3 years ago, 4 years ago... 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 You would of got "Big Pimpin'" 
  
 [Wilson] 
 The relationship being such a high profile relationship, there's people that feel so invested in a positive way, and hate on it because of the negative [criticism]..that's how society is. Is it interesting to be on that forefront where, you know, you have to deal with everybody else's feelings and how much they're impacted by what you're doing and just living your life? 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 I tend not to think about it. If I'm talking about it, we're having a conversation about it, it comes up, I think about it, but everyday when I'm walking around, I don't think about it at all. I know I'm living my life right. I just live my life right, and go about it the right way, and everything will sort itself out. If I'm on the side of right... 
  
 [Wilson] 
 But "On The Run" is a celebration of it in some sense. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 That's what I mean, so I know I'm on the right, so I'm cool..[laughter]..but if I do something wrong a little bit, my Karma is immediate. My karma is immediate, I'll know. I'll know because something will happen, and it'll be like, "oh, that wasn't the right shit to do, I apologize." [laughter] 
  
 [Wilson] 
 Well I'm glad you decided to do this man, I hope it was the right decision [laughter]. 
  
 [Jay Z] 
 Hey, facts only..[laughter][Intro] 
 Uh-huh, yeah hah 
 Never sprung huh? 
 Jigga, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 Never sprung huh? 
 Yeah, peep the repertoire 
 Papas, feel me on this one 
 Papas, feel this 
 Never sprung huh? Know my style 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches 
 Rough bitches, don't matter, you my bitches 
 Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches 
 Can't knock your hustle for real, it's aight bitches 
 I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum French frames 
 With the French name, in the same night 
 Pull you and your tight friend 
 Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in 
 You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R 
 Sexin' in a Lexus car 
 Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all 
 Is like veg-etables in my presence, check it 
 Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard 
 Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs 
 Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred 
 Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em 
 Chicks dream on him, trick cream on him 
 Lose it when dudes think it's just music 
 Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em 
 Sexin' around the way girls down to miras 
 I'm somethin' every girl gotta have like Levi's 
 Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw 
 You can love me or hate me, either or 
 I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys 
 Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Penny 
 Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave 
 Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah 
 Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap 
 Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that 
 You be the same chick when you leave me 
 The bankbook and the credit cards 
 And take everything you came with (it's on) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You know the move's major, never minor 
 'Cause when you a true player, they never find ya 
 We takin' trips abroad with chicks from afar 
 Down in the grill in the villa, gettin' iller 
 Never know I'm at the resort, readin' to Robb Re-pes-ort 
 Checkin' out this new wine, inhalin' the cork 
 Million miles from the puddles, the rainy days, the tussles 
 Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught 
 Had beef of all sort but I turned it around 
 Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin' the ground 
 I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound 
 Now it's million dollar deals, (straight) turnin' 'em down 
 Roc-A-Fella make or break me, 'til death do us 
 Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us 
 Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there 
 Then I realized that it didn't make sense there 
 Backtrack, show me where the cash at 
 And plus, frivolous beef, please, we looking past that 
 Y'all can gossip while we learnin' the world 
 Drop the hot shit, never returnin' your girl, it's on 
  
 [Chorus] 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit? 
 More, dough to get, more shows to rip 
 I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit? 
 Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
 More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?

 Yeah, check it 
 Yo yeah I smoke weed now I don't give a fuck 
 And I also tote guns in case my dram pop up 
 It's crew love I spit two at every few thugs 
 Fo doves blow dubs holdin eight snub 
 I hold it down my strip, goin nowhere 
 Flip two eightballs trick the dough on low gear 
 The next week two O's gone 
 Nigga don't prolong 
 Play the studio and get my flow on 
 And sell weight on a later base 
 My older brother kept guns on his waist in case he air the place 
 And walk straight up on you fuckin crooked niggas 
 Coming out ya mouth sideways like some rookie niggas 
 I drink Henny mixed wit nothing 
 My weed and the dutch is somethin 
 What you niggas sayin nuttin

 Reporting for my live niggas just like me WHAT

 You know it's crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die 
 As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by 
 We could stack dough sky-high 
 Niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real 
 Crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die 
 As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by 
 We could stack dough sky-high 
 Niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real 
  
 [Beanie Siegel] 
 Yo, I set up shop wit nick rocks that'll upset rookies 
 Make 'em slide like li'l dicks in wet pussy 
 Open up the whole strip, like Monopoly 
 Dare one of ya'll to land on my property 
 Think you get some dough for my community chest? 
 Blaow blaow two to yo chest 
 Ya'll niggas can't pass go cuz it cost to pass 
 Ya'll niggas cheap like Baltic Ave 
 Type ta land on jail can't pay your bail 
 Wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think

 Shit I'm the man who supply who supply who supply YOU 
 And ya'll a bunch talk money 
 I'm tryin to get it down for that motherfuckin boardwalk money 
 Two-brick money new blue six money 
 Peru trip money flew in six money 
 Taj Mahal trips orange chips money 
 Long dick money all in yo bitch money 
 Flow like the flu and spit sick money 
 Peep hotty's Roc-A-Fella wools route 
 All black mask down wit they tools out 
 Beanie mack I'll move out 
 I had niggas runnin from school pickin new routes 
 Then I'll run and lick a shot make 'em move south 
 Switch up they last name get a new spouse 
 Scrambled up some down-payment for a new house 
 No matter where you go Mack gone find ya

 Aiyyo I pray to the God MC to bless me 
 Wit a ill ass flow and sick ass dough 
 Where it don't make no sense that hundreds and cents and 
 Thousands of dollars ice freezes my collar 
 Where I need a turtle-neck to rock my check 
 And a pair of isotoners to rock my rings 
 Get the signin bonus know mack toppin them thangs 
 Flip twice rip that crew then I'm droppin my thang 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Nigga it's crew love* original "Maybach Music 2" appeared on Rick Ross' "Deeper Than Rap" 
  
 [Chorus: T-Pain] 
 Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie I'mma make back 
 Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa) 
 You gotta see it, hey! 
 I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach 
 Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music 
  
 [Verse: Jay-Z] 
 It smell like summertime to me! {"What is this?"} 
 First one to cop, I'm the Maybach muse 
 First one in the coupe, I'm on my third six-deuce 
 White guts, black Benz 
 I call that bitch Affirmative Action 
 Oreo, the Obama 
 Curtains drawn, they can't see me, Osama 
 Cashmere throws, that's a splash of class 
 S.C. initials on the Tiffany glass 
 I guess on the initial Maybach 
 I was way too official, they ain't call Jay back 
 I'm just a bully, I apologize 
 And if you would've asked, I probably would've lied 
 Huh, this better, no pressure 
 As my mind reclines on white leathers 
 I think back to my first Maybach 
 Baby blue sides, I called her my Similac 
 Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz 
 Fifty-seven can't catch up to mines 
 No diss to Ricky, this his song 
 But everybody know this the shit that I been on 
 No fives, no four-point-ohs 
 So no partitions, a no-no for Hov' {"Sweet"} 
 I'm a just a top-drawer nigga 
 Penthouse every time, I'm a top-floor nigga 
 As I drift off further 
 Chauffeur serves the city, observers 
 Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside 
 Though I never touch the wheel, I won't lose my drive 
 Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside 
 On the factory shoes, I won't lose my stride 
  
 [Chorus: T-Pain] 
 Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie I'mma make back 
 Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa) 
 You gotta see it, hey! 
 I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach 
 Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music[Intro] 
 Yes! It's the collection! 
 It's ya boy S. Dot 
 Yes! I'ma take this time out to talk to you about The Black Album real quick 
 It's a prequel to all my... uh.. all my albums 
 It's the activities leading up to my first album in '96 
 It's like the book ends for the whole career... you know 
 We gon' take it all the way back 
 It's a time peat circa '88 to '94 maybe 95' 
 We'll put a little bit of '95 in there, you know what I'm saying? 
 All the things that lead to songs like Friend or Foe or D'Evils you know what I'm saying? 
 You know all those activities you know what I'm saying? Yeah 
 It's ya boy Hov! We gon' take y'all back to school, real quick 
 The game is all wrong, business niggas is snitching and it's okay.. 
 We gotta adjust the game, put it back where it's suppose to be 
 We gotta put back the integrity back in music man. You know what I'm saying? 
 Check it out! 
  
 [Verse] 
 There's rules to this shit, consult the OGs 
 Before you dudes make one move on the strip 
 Before you move your lip, take the tool off your hip 
 I'll show you how to do this shit 
 I'll tell you what type of car to buy 
 What type of shoes to get 
 What type of jewels to cop, you could rule this shit 
 Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo's for your chick 
 You gotta treat her right or she gon' mule your shit 
 Do you know the type of damage love could do 
 If she feels she's getting taken advantage of? Ouu! 
 If you wanna understand 
 Standing up like a down chick suppose to? 
 Here I'll coach you, Young ain't fake like most dudes 
 Young move weight like Cool J's trainers, it's a no brainer 
 And don't be wearing no vest with no banger 
 That just makes you a target 
 Young used to run the block, now I corner the market 
 '86 your bullshit, man get smart kid 
 But you ain't want to do no small bid 
 Incarcerated with the hard heads, acting like you hard head 
 That's all dead, get yourself the hog's head 
 Cheese, we could all get, R.S.V.P 
 Man we used to play dolls here, wet niggas with the faucet 
 Come through get your car ran, ran errands for the bosses 
 'Til I became one, now I got linen in the closet 
 I got the blueprint you just gotta follow it 
 Rule number one, real niggas never gossip 
 Rule number two, own The Black Album you gotta cop it 
  
 [Outro] 
 Yeah man! We just gon' bring it back to the game man! Black Album, S.Dot 
 It's the collection, first non-athlete with a shoe, it's history baby...

 Would ya hate me? 
 I know ya love me (Feel this yo, uh) 
  
 [Verse 1: Amil] 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 See me coming through hair done just a slinging my shit 
 With something Gucci on clinging to my hips 
 Fronting with the StarTAC ringing in the whip 
 Icy ears, neck, fingers for years 
 Got the show wild with the toes out 
 Shit, I don't fuck with no stingy nigga 
 I rock Prada, Chanel, and Fendi, nigga 
 What I'ma do with your little blunts and Henny, nigga? 
 I'ma Major Coin with a pretty Bentley, nigga 
 Uh, my niggas will ride for me 
 You should see all the things they buy for me 
 Uh, it's obvious how I spend my time 
 Around ballers all day don't have to spend a dime 
 Callin' up room service when it's dinner time 
 Get my tan on in the tropics in the winter time nigga, uh, uh, uh 
  
 [Chorus: Amil (Beanie Sigel)] 
 Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop) 
 Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)

 I know ya hate me ('Cause you know we got shit locked) 
 Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop) 
 Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top) 
 I know ya love me ('Cause you know we pop 4 Roc) 
 I know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked) 
  
 [Verse 2: Beanie Sigel] 
 Ayo, we gon' stop this here 
 Get this clear the general of the Roc in here 
 Beanie Sigel, hottest thing on the block this year 
 Keep the ego, we been bound to the top ya hear 
 Forget about it you don't know me yo stop the stares 
 I've been about it, pop you then pop ya peers 
 You know how I do six coupe, top be clear 
 You know how I play low layer Rocawear 
 Catch Sigel in the kitchen balloon in the pie 
 Y'all cats know from whom to buy 
 Y'all niggas know if y'all cross Mac, y'all soon to die 
 'Cause you know I bring heat like June and July 
 Spit like August 
 I'm the truth I'm not lying 
 I'm the reason why Jay feel comfortable retiring 
 I gotta laugh 'cause y'all work hard at this shit 
 Think about yo I just started this shit 
 Just imagine if I put my heart in this shit 
 Scary sight y'all niggas feel me right 
 God damn yo I barely write 
 But every rhyme be in check like a pair of Nikes 
  
 [Chorus: Amil (Beanie Sigel)] 
 Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop) 
 Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)

 [Verse 3: Memphis Bleek] 
 Yo, yo, well I'm gold now 
 Memph Man, Coming of Age and I'm grown now 
 Sittin on chrome now 
 I'm the youngest gun, I get it on with anyone 
 I've been in 30 beefs shit I'm barely 21 
 Guns I hold 'em like offensive linemen 
 Bring 'em back to the streets like a brick on consignment 
 Interlining of the Mark Buchanan 
 Spark two hammers 
 Memph Man gold marks the understanding 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] 
 We don't engage in war, we elope 
 Orange juice style, beat niggas to a pulp 
 We broke nigga you just told 3 jokes 
 Me, Biggs, and Dame we get some things 
 See the six? Dame's 
 Me and Biggs live in the Range 
 Mine's platinum, his Champagne 
 Niggas whisper 'cause if they talk they gets slain 
 Y'all's was looking for me on the charts the bricks came 
 Left the same night in the morning the chicks came 
 I just use rap to put shit in my name 
 The death's just a matter of time the hit's been arranged 
 Contracts signed the shits in your name 
 Listen lame rap niggas, I'm the king 
 Motherfuck the ring mami kiss the chain 
 I don't got game to waste on y'all 
 I don't think with my dick or chase my balls 
 I'm a hustla, hit me with an eighth of raw 
 And when I get on top I'ma blaze all y'all 
 Keep 'em laced some more, I know you want some things 
 I drink a lot of water, mami come clean 
 Chicks I pump her then dump her 
 Cars we got 'em bumper to bumper 
 Rap niggas y'all days are numbered 
 Nobody drop nothin' next summer, yeah 
  
 [Chorus: Amil (Beanie Sigel)] 
 Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop) 
 Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top) 
 I know ya love me ('Cause you know we pop 4 Roc) 
 I know ya hate me ('Cause you know we got shit locked) 
 Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop) 
 Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top) 
 I know ya love me ('Cause you know we pop 4 Roc) 
 I know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)

 When they see him, whips be European 
 If you're a ten, chances you're with him 
 If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them 
 Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him 
 No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction 
 He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin' 
 You can't rain dance on his picnic 
 No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness 
 No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4

 But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out 
 Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'mma play shy brother 
 So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe? 
 Then I'mma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group 
 I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo 
 Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals 
 And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials 
 And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential 
 And I - rubbed 'bout every essential 
 That have fun breakin her fundamentals 
 Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium 
 Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium 
 And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney 
 And Rémy and weed, 'til she higher than helium

 Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week 
 Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats 
 The first time niggas heard me spit it in the streets 
 I gave y'all "1000 Bars" with Memphis Bleek 
 Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat 
 6 hammers even though we only 3 deep 
 We clap up niggas 
 Smack up niggas 
 Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas 
 Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas 
 Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas 
 The only thing funny 
 Is y'all never seen big face money 
 Till them big face 20s

 Ya heard me![Intro] 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 We about to change this game here 
 Check my pockets ain't nothing but game there 
 I remain without fear 
 Keep the lames clear, and the cats that's all about scrap remain here 
 On top of this Metropolis 
 My name is like a square 
 Dropped off every tier 
 Now y'all can swear to Jay 
 Heard it the other day 
 Through the mystery, we get it swiftly 
 We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive 
 Need cash to live with, the beat goes on 
 Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on 
 Funny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes 
 And the worst thing worst than getting old is not getting old 
 Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold 
 And watch the hoes with form fitting clothes 
 And I hope they shine 
 Seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes 
 Can't knock the hustle 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 Who do you think you are 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Check this 
 In a mans world need a girl to tough something 
 Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something 
 If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something 
 When I get home 
 Then it's on 
 Girl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs 
 Love the way you behave and beg 
 Moan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team 
 Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226) 
 Life with me, consists of a lot of things 
 Chicks in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things 
 But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness 
 Remind them freak chicks to stay out my business 
 You know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage 
 Came back with six bags struggling 
 In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me 
 Bank still off on me 
  
 [Hook - Meli'sa Morgan] 
 But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy 
 Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle) 
 I don't want no romance, I just want the chance 
 Can't knock the hustle for real 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Ever since you retired, working alongside of live wires 
 In this rap biz with fake nigs, you know liars 
 I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live 
 These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rapping for chips 
 What part of the game is this? 
 Seems brainless, on tours like whores guess what I'm saying I meant 
 Cats that go all out for their gold plaques 
 Started with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's 
 Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped 
 On the weight of me through you, screw you 
 Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes 
 Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU! 
 But that's my cash, I understand you hustle 
 That's my cash, you don't understand 
 Let my dough pass, you can show it love 
 Like a rap star in front of the club 
 But don't knock the hustle 
  
 [Hook]Part I 
 My life after childhood has two main stories: the story of the hustler and the story of the rapper, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I was on the streets for more than half of my life from the time I was thirteen years old. People sometimes say that now I'm so far away from that life - now that I've got businesses and Grammys and magazine covers - that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant is the story of your own life ever going to be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were burned into me like a brand. It was life during wartime.On "Public Service Announcement" 
  
 even when a rapper is just rapping about how dope he is, there’s something a little bit deeper going on. It’s like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have a set structure, but also a limited subject matter. They are mostly about love. Talking on such a familiar subject and writing about it in a set structure forced sonnet writers to find every nook and cranny in the subject and challenged them to invent new language for saying old things. It’s the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar subject in the history of rap -- why I'm dope -- and frame it within the sixteen bar structure of a rap verse, synced to the specific rhythm and feel of the track, more than anything it’s a test of creativity and wit. It’s like a metaphor for itself; if you can say how dope you are in a completely original, clever, powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the boast’s truth. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest versesFrom Negative Space section 
  
 Hip-hop has always been controversial, and for good reason. When you watch a children's show and they've got a muppet rapping about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. The music is meant to be provocative - which doesn't mean it's necessarily obnoxious, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it's dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily figure out the first time you listen to it. Instead it plants dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that knocks in the club or has witty punch lines the first time you hear it. But great rap retains mystery. It leaves shit rattling around in your head that won't make sense till the fifth or sixth time through. It challenges you 
  
 Which is the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem isn't in the rap or the rapper or the culture. The problem is that so many people don't even know how to listen to the music 
  
 Since rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can’t just half-listen to a song once and think you’ve got it. Here’s what I mean: A poet’s mission is to make words do more work than they normally do, to make them work on more than one level. For instance, a poet makes words work sonically - as sounds, as music. Hip-hop tracks have traditionally been heavy on the beats, light on melody, but some MCs - Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony, for example - find ways to work melodies into the rapping. Other MCs - think about Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool chief rocka, I don’t drink vodka, but keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don’t mean much, but he snaps those clipped syllables out like drumbeat, bap bap bapbap. It’s as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came away thinking it was a simple rhyme about holding weed in a gym locker, you’d be reading it wrong: The point of those bars is to bang out a rhythmic idea, not to impress you with the literal meaning of the words 
  
 But great MCing is not just about filling in the meter of the song with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get at complicated truths in a way that straightforward storytelling fails to do. The word you use can be read a dozen different ways: They can be funny and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be nakedly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is deceptive. It seems so straightforward and personal and real that people read it completely literally, as raw testimony, or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, It’s all white noise to them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run off yelling “See!” and feel vindicated in their narrow conception of what the music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her drop a line about drinking or sleeping with someone’s husband and then dismissing her as an alcoholic adulterer 
  
 But I can’t say I’ve ever given much of a fuck about people who hear a curse word and start foaming at the mouth. The Fox News dummies. They wouldn’t know art if it fell on them.This collaboration lives in a place of giving and is about the Foundation. I am not making a dime from this collection; I do not stand to make millions, as falsely reported. I need to make that fact crystal clear. The Shawn Carter Foundation is the beneficiary and the foundation is receiving 25% of all sales from the collaboration, 10% of all sales generated in the store on November 20th and, an additional donation from Barneys. This money is going to help individuals facing socio-economic hardships to help further their education at institutions of higher learning. My idea was born out of creativity and charity… not profit. 
  
 I move and speak based on facts and not emotion. I haven’t made any comments because I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys. Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately? The negligent, erroneous reports and attacks on my character, intentions, and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement I didn’t want to make without the full facts. Making a decision prematurely to pull out of this project, wouldn’t hurt Barneys or Shawn Carter, but all the people that stand a chance at higher education. I have been working with my team ever since the situation was brought to my attention to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesn’t harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration. 
  
 I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgements, no matter who it’s towards, aren’t I committing the same sin as someone who profiles? I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position. Hopefully this brings forth a dialogue to affect real change. – Shawn “JAY Z” CarterTufAmerica Inc alleges in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that Jay Z's "Run This Town" samples the 1969 song 'Hook & Sling' more than a dozen times. The song, recorded by Eddie Bo, is now owned by TufAmerica, who bought the rights 15 years ago. 
  
 Unlike many other such lawsuits, the allegedly lifted samples are not easy to discern. In fact, I'm having a hard time finding any sonic similarities in the two tracks. 
  
 What do you think? 
  
 Peep the two songs and see if you can make out the alleged illegal samples. Use the suggestion box below to tell us if you agree with the lawsuit.

 I'm a hustler's hustler 
 A gangster's gangster 
 I'm a rapper's rapper 
 Your favorite, ain't I 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm still winning and I'm nowhere near finished 
 It's just the first inning 
 And I'm gunning for the Pennant 
 And I been this, God made me 
 Y'all hate me, y'all atheists 
 Y'all safety is at risk 
 It's the return of the Messiah 
 One and only Hov 
 No I ain't God but I've been made in his mould 
 So when the story is told let it be said I refuse to fold 
 I only fold bread 
 I stood for the best, I owed no debt 
 I represent the hood til my dying breath 
 I took a pay cut to become an exec 
 So the next motherfucker can earn his paycheck 
 And even though these niggas talk greasy bout me 
 Ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me 
 Ask these niggas if they want stats involved 
 And even if they don't like me, they respect the God 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm hustler's poster child, I'm supposed to style 
 I ain't got nothing to prove, I'm supposed to smile 
 I ain't insecure, I'm vested in a piece of Carol's Daughter 
 I'm in Sephora 
 Bricks are insignificant to him 
 He's a grown man, you're an infant to him 
 Take your baby money and burn, T-Ha 
 I spent that on furniture 
 I got Warhols on my hall's wall 
 I got Basquiats in the lobby of my spot 
 I'm so sophisticatedly hood, S. Carter cashmere premium goods 
 Thousand dollars for the sneaks 
 Timbo on the track, 250 for the beat 
 G4 back and forth to my floor seats 
 I spent a couple mil' just to lose to the Heat 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Anything you aspire, to acquire I got 
 Any gun you say, you fired 
 I shot Any type of paraphernalia, I am the seller 
 I guess you're saying that's how I started Roc-A-Fella 
 Feds all fed up 
 DEA can't tell the dirty money from a Rocawear sweater 
  
 [Refrain x9] 
 And I'm never, ever going back, back 
 Oh never that, oh never that 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Whoever rap, you be doing that for practice, nigga 
 I'm in the twelve-step program 
 I ain't touched drugs in so long I'm a sober man 
 I'm clean as a whistle, official 
 Got a way, I'm the King of all kings, it's official 
 I'm a hustler's hustler 
 A gangster's gangster 
 I'm a rapper's rapper 
 Your favorite, ain't I 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I[Verse] 
 Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump 
 I'm cancer to the Hamptons 
 20 million a wop, ransackin' mansions 
 Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in 
 Don't even trust uppity white folks 
 Keep the cannon tuck 
 Niggas tryin' to lean on Jay, shots gon' stand you up 
 Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understandin' much 
 I hustle for the duckets 
 Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby 
 I just love it 
 Chicks now say they like the way I thug it 
 Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public 
 Ladies I love y'all 
 But I love my freedom more 
 I love my niggas, love to see them ball 
 I love Beans and Bleek 
 Them niggas like my Peter and Paul 
 My disciples, and that's right we comin' for the title... 
 Do you believe? It's Hova the God[Verse 1] 
 Thirteen, I was a thug, selling drugs 
 Many people thought I flipped my wig, sorta bugged 
 But I shrugged 'em off, like who cares what they say? 
 They was getting jelly and I was getting paid 
 Wasn't afraid to chase dough 
 Wasn't afraid to catch a case so 
 As long as the papes flowed 
 Warnings I took 'em like yeah yeah, if you say so 
 Ladies I book 'em with some cash and hey ho 
 I rolled in cars Pops never seen 
 I rolled with stars and ladies from the magazine 
 Getting dirty down low dough making it clean 
 And mind you I was only thirteen 
 A rebel with a cause 
 A street level hustler with cash coming out the pores 
 Breaking laws, breaking jaws, and taking whores 
 Probably taking yours, yours, yours, and maybe yours 
 But most important, taking care of the family 
 Still, most people don't understand me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 By fifteen, many brothers had to run 
 I had mad dough, mad friends, and mad guns 
 Nothing to lose 
 Make it big or make the news 
 Take your pick, I got shit under both shoes 
 So I'm clocking 
 Because opportunity don't come knocking 
 On the door in the projects, socking 'em 
 Nine to five, please 
 I'm talking about five to nine G's in three hours easy 
 I had to block in to smash 
 Try to slow up my cash and better dash to Jake before I break your ass 
 'Cause I'm not to be played out 
 Folks that try to play Jay, well OK, you getting laid out 
 I had no problem with smoking the rope 
 Cause there's no joking with dough 
 No warning shots so I'm hoping you know 
 I had a supply so I was in demand G 
 Ladies loved I, niggas couldn't stand me 
 But they wouldn't bring the noise 
 'Cause I got boys that got Buck Rogers like (?) 
 So brothers ought to give it a second thought 'fore you caught speeding 
 External, internal, fuck him, he's bleeding 
 And it's back to the norm 
 Making cold cash so fast and keeping ladies warm 
 Still checking in on the family 
 Still, most people don't understand me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Just dude is no just dude 
 So I just do what I just do to keep a buck or two 
 What's my options? 
 Tell me before you say stop and I tell you about that weak shit you popping 
 I'm from the projects, wasn't for me 
 By nineteen, I'd be in jail, smoking or buying the key 
 Which one would you choose out of the three? 
 Yeah I know, go for the 40 G's 
 It's no longer for the family they no longer need 
 But for the greed, getting props, and being top seed 
 Sis tells me to slow up, whoa 
 I didn't hear a peep when I was keeping your belly full 
 And you was happy when all your nappies had new kicks 
 I didn't hear shit, so you quit 
 I got large and forgot the family 
 And now nobody understands me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do? 
 Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do? 
 I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do?[JAY Z: Intro] 
 I told y'all niggas if it wasn't a skirt it was gonna be a dress 
 Don't give a fuck who you are 
  
 [Verse: Jay-Z] 
 I makes the whole city hot like fiddy shots at idi-ots 
 Show him I got more then take the shit he got, Biatch! 
 Big poison and fuck up the city rots 
 The whole world supposing he's tryna dispose of me 
 You must know I give a fuck though, got a mean rebuttal 
 Try me! See where your luck go, you know what though? 
 I'm what you don't get a second chance at 
 Think you can chance that? 
 I'm laying niggas down ba'y bro 
 Think you can stand that? 
 Your train of thought derails like amtrak 
 My grand stack, hands free and a six; vivid jam-packed 
 Me, my crimees, and a couple of dime pieces 
 A bunch of rolexes, unlimited credit line visas 
 Heat is for niggas that want to touch but can't reach us 
 To each his own y'all can eat this chrome 
 Leave him speechless when the lead reaches his dome 
 Life ain't nothing but beaches and homes[Hook: R. Kelly] 
 Big chips! (Woo!) 
 We off in Vegas drinking and partying 
 We got chicks in swimsuits modeling 
 We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low 
 The way the wrist shine it's so magical 
 You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!) 
 Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov 
 With the second coming of Best Of Both 
 In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] (R. Kelly) 
 Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga 
 Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh) 
 Any day they could dig your grave 
 Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig? 
 No reward unless the risk is taken 
 In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places 
 I, on the other hand, relish the situation 
 Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious 
 I went overboard, look at this big bracelet 
 I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it 
 From the time that I bought it I just replaced it 
 I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this 
 Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this 
 Ma, you rolling? I'm as real as it gets 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
  
 [Verse 2: R. Kelly] 
 Big chips! I can't take this 
 The way you move your ass slow like Matrix 
 You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas 
 Before I toss chips, first, get naked 
 I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it 
 Superstar honey, so mean and vicious 
 Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious 
 Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!) 
 So go low mama, give it a go 
 As I punch 170 on stretch roads 
 Must turn up the radio 
 Girl you so good I'm swerving like 'Whoa, whoa!' 
 Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch 
 Out the stretch to the hotel, into the hotel suite! 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Big chips! I'm a boss I said 
 Tilt my hat and I cross my legs 
 Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread 
 And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin 
 And stick Cochran on any DA why try to stop him 
 So any gunplay, that is an option 
 I been doing this since niggas was wopping 
 Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and 
 Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching 
 To try to get real, you had to drop 'em 
 See I ain't never been a fronter 
 Or fake it till I make it type nigga 
 Ma I don't want ya number 
 Either you're coming or aIone ya 
 Either you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya 
 You play pretty if you wanna 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
  
 [Bridge: R. Kelly] 
 All around the world, stop where the sun sets 
 Spending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!) 
 You wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!) 
 Say we going around the world, stop where the sun sets 
 Spending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!) 
 Do you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!) 
  
 [Outro: R. Kelly] 
 Uh, come on, Tone, I see ya, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters 
 What's really good, we in the islands chillin in the shade and shit you know 
 Blue waters, yellow sand, uh 
 Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin[Intro: Swizz Beatz] 
 Swizzy... Beatz...

 Ayo I cannot (STOP), I will not (STOP) 
 AS.. WE.. PROCEED.. 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Young Hov got the block on smash 
 Put the gun to the back and hop on some ass 
 Nigga fresh-dressed and stay poppin' tags 
 Put the Ewings on the truck 'for I drop the rag 
 Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past 
 It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash 
 I'm legendary in the hood so I got the mag 
 And I've never been a fronter so I've got to blast 
 Will I flash... not... 
 As I'm not playing with you motherfuckers the laughter stops 
 When your casket drops 
 You bastards not gon' assassinate the name I got 
 Ya'll don't hear me though 
 Young Hov got the block on smash 
 And everybody and their momma want to stop my cash 
 Everybody want drama with the top of the brass 
 'Til I come through hop out the cap 
 1-8-7 they ass 
  
 [Bridge] 
 (STOP) somebody gon' (DROP) 
 Y'all don't hear me though... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I cannot (STOP), I will not (STOP) 
 AS.. WE.. PROCEED.. 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Young Hov got the game in a frenzy 
 Twenty million sold all independently 
 So when you mention me 
 Make sure you got together your similes 
 Like he's the game's J.F. Kennedy 
 Uhh, I started out I ain't have no chimney 
 My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be 
 'Til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct I caught her under the Christmas tree 
 Young Hov ain't have no pops 
 Thank God man I had the block 
 Ya'll don't hear me though 
 You young fucks got the game all wrong 
 This is my life man this ain't no song 
 You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house 
 In that tight-ass room, pullin' that [?] out 
 And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself 
 You American Pie, stop feeling yourself 
 Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself 
 Stop being a server, get a meal yourself 
 Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of y'all gats 
 We got bigger ones 
 I mean niggas done shot at me shivering 
 They were so scared they ain't hit me once 
 Young Hov 'bout to go to the range 
 'Bout to work on perfecting my aim 
 Y'all don’t hear me though 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I cannot…… 
 I cannot…… 
 I will not…… 
 As we proceedYeah 
 I'm from where dreamin' ain't allowed 
 'Specially when you're dreamin' aloud 
 Enough to dream your self-esteem into clouds 
 It takes tears, sweat, blood, 5 CCs 
 'Cause I know what a kid in apartment 5C see'd 
 Heaven knows, all I had was hella hope 
 Speed datin' with destiny, I couldn't tell her nope 
 When I first saw stars, television was my telescope 
 For me, somethin' that could see me free was a bar 
 Threw diamonds in the sky that never came down, now that's a star 
 My vision was big enough to get me out of the space 
 I wanted to pass how far I see 
 I wondered, could a kid from Mars see a kid from Marcy? 
 For things that are seen are temperal 
 The most beautiful things are invisible 
 Roc Nation, indivisible 
 American dream team 
 Paper planes turned into the real thing 
 You are whatever you say you are 
 Turn any situation around 
 Who. Are. You? 
 God[Intro] 
 B-I, what up? 
 Long as I got a voice, you got a voice my nigga 
 Yessir 
  
 [Hook] 
 BK stand up, Brooklyn throw your hands up 
 If you with me, lick a shot for Biggie 
  
 [Verse One] 
 Chillin' in the spot in my B-Boy stance 
 Don't make this four-fifth kick like Bruce Lee roy pants 
 You know I'm smarter than Spock, for Leonard Nimoy fans 
 So this aluminum will foil your plans, that's how I'm doin' em man 
 I keep two in hand, in case I've been drinkin' 
 Seeing double, I got one for you and your twin 
 I got a nickel for your thoughts, make your blood trickle 
 Leave your smarts on the sidewalk, 'til the cops come and get you 
 I'm done playin' with you 
 The guns sprayin' with or without you 
 Make your body whistle without you, Young! 
 I'm still official without you 
 Still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh 
 He's so terrific, his lyrics like it's about you 
 You can't tell me that everything he spits that it's not true 
 I'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against wall 
 Took a lighter, left my name in the hall, Young! 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 Grew up on Lexington Ave, my socks real high 
 Moved to the Marcy Projects 'round the time I was five 
 Had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'Stuy 
 So on the Fourth of July, we would always stop by 
 Man, I ran through the bush, bought pounds from "the dreads" 
 They had the best beef patties and cocoa bread 
 Played the Albee Square Mall 'round the time I was gettin' tall 
 Where niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor 
 18 regime round then, Pink houses, Fort Greene niggas they ain't blend 
 Wasn't safe on the A train, D, G or the F 
 Decepticons, Lo-Life niggas snatch the Polo off your chest 
 East New York, Bushwick, fuck it, the whole BK 
 Brownsville, where the warriors come out to play 
 Nigga you better roll deep goin' through Coney Island 
 'cause it's one way out, nigga, one way in, nigga 
  
 [Hook x2] 
  
 [Verse Three] 
 Everywhere you go, Brooklyn's in the house, if you soft tuck your chain 
 The crooks is in the house, yes, the jooks is in route 
 The drama's on the way 
 Stare downs first, then the llamas gon' spray 
 Momma's gon' pray 
 But we respect real, you act like a sheep, you gon' be the next meal 
 The wolves is on the job 
 Gotta get in where we fit in 
 Not rid the show and the kids is growing 
 Baby need new shoes, and you sitting on 22's 
 And we got guns big as Samoans 
 And you in the spot showing off like Terrell Owens 
 Hell I'm on this nigga 
 You better hold your ground, if you a straw house 
 Then the fours will blow you down and its back to the home town, yes! 
  
 [Hook x2][Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 No more Reasonable Doubt, I've proven to be the illest MC 
 Something's wrong with ya motor skills 'cause y'all ain't movin' me 
 I'm who you see musically when you want it done hot 
 Comparin' you to me is a lesson in futility, STOP! 
 I paint pictures beautifully but niggas is near sighted 
 Don't worry about plagiarism, it'll take 'em years to bite it 
 But ya greatest fear is I don't write it 
 It just appears out of nowhere 
 Like the information obtained by a psychic 
 Like it or not I pay dues and expect to be paid back 
 Why the fuck should I freestyle I'm gettin' paid to rap 
 I slay the track laid back, almost 'til it's a sin 
 Tell ya God somebody's doin' a good job impersonatin' him 
 Jay-Hova, spittin' game from the Range Rover 
 What the fuck is y'all doin' in the third lane? GET OVER 
 Slow ya rota, I got it sewed up like a tailor 
 Relatively easy like Jerry Heller 
 Cream is cherry vanilla got chicks in the telly 
 Belly up, soundin' like Mahalia tryin' to tell y'all 
 Y'all know the style, burn the town down 
 And change the locale, I'm doin the same shit 'cept its legit 
 It's Jigga 
  
 [Chorus: Boo] 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit 
  
 [Verse 2: Gotti] 
 Pimp Gotti get the dues in them double down 
 Like them kids with tips who tops down 
 Bricks who get money quick see me 
 Representin' bomb city on the bill block rockin' mics 
 Before they get a mil', I sold pills all night 
 The illest outta life got my mind on fate 
 'Cause even on tour nigga still ain't safe 
 I keep a tre eight on my left 
 Smoke a L for stress countin' dirt bag lex 
 I be the, X like Malcolm 
 Puff for now dunn east side represent with tons of guns 
 You keep it real where you from 
 'Cause where you at might put the dagger in yo' back 
 It's like livin' with yo homie that be on crack 
 In fact my niggas know my style's phat like hoes in the El Dorado 
 My mind totin', fuck 'em, duck 'em 
 Any thing but the main gun I don't trust 'em 
  
 [Chorus: Boo] 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit 
  
 [Verse 3: Boo] 
 Cool with the nigga huh, fro main chilla 
 Berg shit, word shit, I splurge with scrilla 
 Observe when you work spit bird shit killer 
 Not to be perturbed with, herb shit dealer 
 Can make me feel y'all fo' real ya tock tickin' 
 Bust a rapper bust a cap hustler stop flinchin' 
 You fresh off the corner calling dog shit brog shit 
 Soon as you feel that sog shit you be like oh shit (stoooooop) 
 Broke niggas resort the glass lookin' 
 Opposite the track ass whoopin' 
 Opposite the black class hooker the fat ass fooker 
 Triple your cash criple your stash pass shooker 
 The past ain't never the last to teach lessons 
 My peeps fuckin' up in the streets keep guessin' 
 Brew don't becomin' a preach I be blessin' 
 Lot of kids comin' out the wrong way like C-sections 
 Know the bro gone flow even if it cross shorts 
 Fuck weed cop coke 'cause the shit cost more 
 But niggas say I floss to much 
 But when I take it off and such they say I lost my touch 
 Those bitches like the money I wear 
 What its funny how they stare 
 Dumb bunnies with they cunnin' little glare 
 Shorty let me see the tail if its really that shittin' 
 She hit me with a felion a young pair kitten 
 My boy hit that shit now every body smitten 
 Even holdin snow balls and I ain't talkin 'bout mittens 
 What I talkin 'bout mittens, fo' real 
  
 [Chorus: Boo] 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit 
 Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit 
 You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit 
 Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit 
 They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh 
 This beat is like you just walking in place like this 
 Let me try to get through this here... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all wanna take my life, then come and get it 
 I'm so committed to street life, sometimes I don't sleep nights 
 If y'all ain't ready to die, my advice would be to 
 Back up and live, cause the fact of this is 
 I keep .44s in the sky, mind on my money 
 Nigga, I'm so for real, I hope you're not finding this funny, nah 
 Live everyday like my last, fast money 
 Fast cars, fast temper, draw down faster than y'all 
 I got to get my shit off, I came from nothin' 
 But pop's dick, mom's egg, hungry like a hostage 
 With every step that I take I use my hood sense 
 Study my footprints, learn from my mistakes 
 I'm much braver than most, got the heart of ghost 
 I was born dead, baby, my life is all gravy 
 Reporting live from the ROC, I rep for my set 
 Till the date of my death, I will die for my block 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Timbaland] 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about that cash 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about my cash 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!) 
 Live everyday like my last... 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 If there was heaven above us, I was living in hell 
 My neighborhood was the roughest, I never complained 
 I just adjusted my game, pushed 20s of 'caine 
 Bush and Reagan couldn't stop me from makin' 
 I wish I could dream about being a lawyer 
 But I had dealers in my hallway, death around the corner 
 Couldn't tell right from wrong, pimps will spoil you 
 Give you dollars for errands when nobody was carin' 
 I got to get my shit off, it rang true every time 
 I heard it or every time somebody got murdered 
 We pour liquor on the curb until the cement stain 
 I cried enough tears from my eyes to equal 3-inch rain 
 Motherfuckers, I deserve it when I be in the Range 
 I copped them uncut stones that be freezing the chain 
 I done been through enough shit to make you pee in your pants 
 Man, I'm sorry if we ain't seeing the same, I seen it rain 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Timbaland] 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about that cash 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about my cash 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!) 
 Live everyday like my last... 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 That's why I give you my up and downs, my pain, my passion, my pleasure 
 My good and bad times, niggas, my whatever 
 My hopes and dreams, blood, tears and sweat 
 My version of R. Kelly, this is a nigga's threat 
 My life is an open book, nigga, I hope you took from it 
 Whatever works for you, I was put on this earth to move 
 Mountains, I think, I'm almost sure 
 But I've been smoking a lot lately, not counting my drinks 
 I got to get my shit off, for that I'm certain 
 That's why it's less than 8 months, I am back to work 
 Nigga, I'm clear, I done seen my cupboards bare 
 Heard money mentioned in my mother's prayer 
 Had nights my stomach filled up with nothing but air 
 Got 10 dollars to eat for 4 of us to share 
 That's why Hov' act like that, quick to snap 
 MAC-11 ready, I ain't going back 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z & Timbaland] 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about that cash 
 I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off) 
 Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off) 
 Get off my ass and get about my cash 
 Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!) 
 Live everyday like my last...[Intro]

 And even worse, if I was broke would you want me 
 If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings 
 Jigga's kill for would you still roll 
 If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand 
 Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving 
 If I wasn't a by the name of 
 Would you come around me or would you clown me 
 If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya 
 Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya 
 See yourself with a working harder than nine to five 
 Then ten to six, two jobs to survive, or 
 Do you need a so you can shop and tear the mall up 
 Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya 
 If you couldn't see yourself with a player when his dough is low 
 Baby girl, if this is so, yo 
  
 [Hook]

 [Verse 1: Jay-Z (Swizz Beatz)] 
 Yeah, you would think I was on 'roids 
 I been hitting so long and I'm a big headed boy 
 Nah we ain't on HGH 
 Though I might pick up some weight when I'm running through your state 
 (Running through your state) Nah, nah, nah, we ain't on the clear 
 We on the runway in back to back Lairs (in the air) 
 Yeah Yeah, it's Ms. No More Drama 
 And Barack Obama rhymers, feel honored (talk to 'em Hov) 
 I put my life on these tracks 
 You act like y'all don't wanna pay me for the facts 
 Luckily my therapy is to rap 
 I just bare my soul I don't expect nothing back (get it up) 
 You're all welcome, long as you felt them 
 I was gon' get mine, you know where the hell I'm from 
 I'm from the bottom, so I do this from the diapers 
 Quick fast, turn the Big Apple into cider 
 I do this, I'm a writer and a rider 
 Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers (tell 'em again Hov) 
 I'm a writer and a rider 
 Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers, you're welcome

 Viva Hovito, my nino, muy bien 
 Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them 
 Until I reach Colleek, I do it for him 
 Do it for those who can't do for self due to the pen 
 May these bars reach through your bar 
 And Ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (*hands up!) 
 God so Lisa Stansfield you are 
 Love Is A Battlefield, we all get scarred 
 I put my heart into this 
 This is much more than marketed music 
 The reason I got a market to do this 
 As there's people going through pain, I'm just walking 'em through this 
 (I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music 
 People going through pain, I'm just talking 'em through it, you're welcome

 [Verse 3: Mary J. Blige (Swizz Beatz)] 
 If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream 
 And you made our dreams come true 
 That's why y'all don't need to thank us 
 'Cause we do this all for you (talk to 'em Mary!) 
 We know what you were going through 
 Because we were going through it too 
 When no one seems to understand 
 We were always there to hold your hand 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz) 
 Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands 
 I also said, "Watch the man hopping out of vans" 
 I ain't only teach you about Evisu 
 I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, you're welcome

 To all of y'all keeping y'all in health 
 Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself 
 You're all, you're all 
 You all are welcome 
 Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up[Verse 1: Biggie] 
 It was all a dream 
 I used to read Word Up magazine 
 Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
 Hangin pictures on my wall 
 Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
 I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped 
 Smoking weed and Bambu, sipping on Private Stock 
 Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
 With the hat to match 
 Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha 
 You never thought that hip hop would take it this far 
 Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight 
 Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
 Born sinner, the opposite of a winner 
 Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner 
 Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri 
 Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup) 
 I'm blowing up like you thought I would 
 Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right) 
 It's all good (it's all good) 
  
 [Hook: Alicia Keys] 
 New York 
 Concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh 
 There's nothing you can’t do 
 Now you’re in New York 
 These streets will make you feel brand new 
 Big lights will inspire you 
 Let's hear it for New York 
  
 [Verse 2: Biggie] 
 I made the change from a common thief 
 To up close and personal with Robin Leach 
 And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day 
 Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way 
 The Moet and Alizé keep me pissy 
 Girls used to diss me 
 Now they write letters cause they miss me 
 I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff 
 I was too used to packing gats and stuff 
 Now honeys play me close like butter play toast 
 From the Mississippi down to the east coast 
 Condos in Queens, indo for weeks 
 Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak 
 Living life without fear 
 Putting 5 karats in my baby girl's ears 
 Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool 
 Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school 
 Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood 
 And it's still all good 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Like a mama you birth me, Brooklyn you nursed me 
 Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley 
 They said you'd murk me, by the time I was twenty one 
 That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me 
 Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter 
 Guess what I'm a call her, Brooklyn Carter 
 When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend ya 
 Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner 
 And I'm eating, so much I bought extra 
 So much so the dinners now turn into breakfast 
 I only roll Lexus, to hug your road 
 I love your corners, I'm half your soul 
  
 [Hook]In 1986, when I was coming of age, Ronald Reagan doubled down on the war on drugs, that had been started by Richard Nixon in 1971. Drugs were bad, fried your brain and drug dealers were monsters, sole reason neighborhoods and major cities were failing. Nobody wanted to talk about Reaganomics and the ending of social safety nets. The defunding of schools and the loss of jobs in cities across America. 
  
 Young men like me who hustled became the sole villains and drug addicts lacked moral fortitude. In the 1990's incarceration rates in the US blew up, today we imprison more people than any other country in the world; China, Russia, Iran, Cuba. All countries we consider autocratic and repressive, yeah more than them. 
  
 Judges hands were tied by tough on crime laws, and they were forced to hand out mandatory life sentences for simple  possession and low level drugs sales. My home state of New York started this with Rockefeller laws, then the feds made distinction between people who sold powder cocaine and crack cocaine even though they were the same drug, only difference is how you take it, and even though white people used and sold crack more than Black people, somehow it was Black people who went to prison. 
  
 The media ignored actual data to this day, crack it's still talked about as Black problem. The NYPD raided our Brooklyn neighborhoods while Manhattan bankers openly used coke with impunity. The war on drugs exploded the US prison population disproportionately locking away Black and Latinos, our prison populations grew more than 900%. When the war on drugs began in 1971 our prison population was 200 thousand. Today it is over 2 million. 
  
 Long after the crack era ended we continued our war on drugs. There were more than 1.5 million drug arrests in 2014, more than 80% were for possession only. Almost half were for marijuana. People are finally talking about treating addiction to harder drugs as a health crisis, but there is no compassionate language about drug dealers, unless of course we're talking about places like Colorado whose state economy got a huge boost by the above ground marijuana industry. 
  
 A few states south in Louisiana they're still handing mandatory sentences for people who sell weed, despite a booming and celebrated 50 billion legal marijuana industry, most states still disproportionally hand out mandatory sentences to Black and Latinos with drug cases. If you're entrepreneurial living in one of the many states that are passing legalize laws you may still face barriers participating in the above ground economy. Venture capitalists migrate to these states to open multi billion dollar operations, but former felons can't open a dispensary. Lots of times those felonies were drug charges, caught by poor people who sold drugs for living but are now prohibited from participating in one of the fastest growing economies. Got it? 
  
 In states like New York where holding marijuana is no longer grounds for arrest, police issue possession citations in Black and Latino neighborhoods at a far higher rate than other neighborhoods. Kids in Crown Heights are constantly stopped and ticketed for trees, kids at dorms in Columbia where rates of marijuana use are equal or worse than those in the hood are never targeted or ticketed. Rates of drug use are as high as they were when Nixon declared this so-called war in 1971. 
  
 Forty-five years later it's time to rethink our policies and laws. The war on drugs is an epic fail.[Jay Z Verse 1] 
  
 Fuck what they all say 
 Niggas can't stop me with rumors, Im too strong 
 All day, socks exploding sweat pants pockets is bulging 
 Holding it down on the corner with my block frozen 
 My spot is rolling, drop the price of the coke and 
 Drove the competition out and let the doe flow in 
 The cops is closing in, I can do the time 
 But whats really on my mind, there ain't no ho's in the pen 
 I play the low and try to make it hard to find me 
 Feds still tryna build a case since 93 
  
 [DMX Verse 2] 
  
 Yo, moves is made, Niggas is paid, that's just how it is 
 When my time is up, Ima be out but ima try to live 
 I'm eating day by day ain't nothing sweet about it 
 Act like you don't know what I'm saying and they'll read about it 
 Built for war like an armadillo 
 Smother your ass with 2 through the pillow 
 Cause my shit is brillo 
 Manic depressive and my head hurts 
 Yo, give me your doe and your ho 
 And here take these four hot things, I got things 
 That make niggas spin, put niggas in the wind 
 Where you never see niggas again 
 I bless a nigga with stitches, the thin type 
 And a straight razor will put pin stripes, across your wind pipes 
  
 [ Hashim Hakim Verse 3] 
  
 Start off my day and I'm off and running and I miss my gun 
 I'm often blessed but not these days cause its no longer fun 
 I am way worse then a banger with 8 bullets left in the chamber 
 Can't imagine the danger, when you done got these bow ties angered 
 When strangers pissed me off, I got high to control it 
 You think I don't get tempted, that would be a lie if I told it, can't hold it 
 Outside opposition , got stress on my mind 
 But I got inside opposition, coming from my own kind and they're blind 
 We walk in peace but don't provoke us, we ain't gon' run 
 We fight with those who fight with us but nigga I ain't the one 
 You niggas oughta be glad OG got hold of us 
 Cause if it wasn't for that man, there be no controlling us 
 His body laid in red rum, twisted in broken poses 
 Blood puddle soaked in his clothes and it look like roses 
 Smelling Folgers and Moses couldn't save him 
 We leaving the way we came, As-salamu alaykum[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Turn the music up, uh uh uh, turn the music up 
 Old school, new school, need to know this 
 I burn like Left Eye Lisa Lopes 
 Burn slow like blunts of hydro 
 Jigga Man, BK shit, y'all know 
 Jigga Man, ya heard? The fugitive 
 Allow me to vent on this Clue shit 
 Allow me to say thanks to all the people for all their support, and your prayers 
 And all the people that pre-judge me: Fuck you, suck my dick... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 D.A. act like a nigga starvin' for Jay 
 If they lock me in a cage, fuck it, party away 
 I'm still hot, I'm still S-dot ya'll 
 Still got millions buried in the sock drawer 
 Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga 
 What don't kill me can only make me stronger nigga 
 And when I get back home 
 Get your ass up out the throne 
 It's just goin' back to the way shit was 
 I'mma stay hot no matter what my shit does 
 I could drop a straight dud, I'mma stay up 
 Niggas tryin' break my will 
 You know that ain't my steel 
 I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed 
 You're dealin' with a higher power 
 I'm like Dwight Eisenhower 
 My life can move a thousand miles and hour 
 Reflect me folks 
 As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke 
 It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series 
 All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury 
 All this bullshit can make the mind weary 
 But my theory is the sun shines clearly 
 (The Sun will shine clearly!) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov 
 Cause I rhyme like I be rhymin' in the Rov' 
 Climbin' in them hoes 
 My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows 
 I don't shine, I glow 
 I remind you of that dough 
 Don't I? Murder niggas won't I? 
 My persona, hustler turned rapper, smell the crack aroma 
 Send shots like toma! in any language 
 Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth 
 Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs 
 And get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements 
 And for what? Ya'll actin' like ya'll better than Hov 
 Ya'll niggas should open up for the Letterman show 
 Niggas is funny 
 All I do is get money and ya'll niggas sound funny to me 
 Everybody's rappin' like they better than Hov 
 But that shit's real funny to me 
 I'm at the forefront of this rap shit, truth is truth 
 Look around at all the platinum, proof is proof 
 Listen to how niggas is rappin', thats due to who? 
 But I'mma let niggas live cause it's beautiful 
  
 Live niggas... 
 Jigga Man ya heard? Clue... Duro...I deserve a gold medal, get on my level 
 I deserve platinum plaques, to match my bezel 
 I walk around with five rings, so pimpish 
 Welcome to the Paralympics 
 It’s paradise, this is the story of Gabby 
 It’s paradise, it’s paradise 
 Tears in her eyes, she sacrificed, he sacrificed, she paid the price 
 This is everything, everything she ever dreamed 
 She had nightmares she wouldn’t be here, she made the team 
 From the projects to the podium, accepting awards with my Rollie on 
 Gettin’ Gold medals with my grill in 
 C-walking, cause all they see is a villain 
 More belts than Phelps, Merry Christmas, my presence is felt 
 Gold medals around my throat, you can take everything, except my hope of reaching 
 Paradise, paradise 
 Whoa-o-o-o-o[Produced by Clark Kent] 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z and DJ Clark Kent] 
 Gotta reach the top (You gotta persevere) 
 Can't wait another year 
 I gotta reach the top (Yo Jay, your time's near) 
 I gotta reach the top; fuck that, my time is here 
 Yeah! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I came up far so brothers can know my name 
 I paid so many dues now I'm looking for change 
 Too many years wasted 
 Too many years on the set seeing the flavors, but I never did taste it 
 I gotta reach the top before I'm done with it 
 So much hard work now its time to have some fun with it 
 I got my eyes on the number one nigga 
 Watch your spot on the charts, "Here I come nigga!" 
 You hear the footsteps, you hear the sound 
 The only way I got to go is up the only way you got to go is down 
 Now relax on your laurels I ain't faking jack 
 So with your $8.99 plus tax spent on my wax 
 Your Freud, paranoid 
 Brothers afraid to be unemployed because Jay-Zs' ready to play with the big boys 
 I gots to get it, 'til then I won't stop 
 Too many years rock bottom, I gotta reach the top 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I gots to give them lots of rhythm 
 When all hell breaks loose I'm performing exorcisms 
 Lurking in the shadows 
 Ready to put work in 
 A hurting on competitions is curtains 
 I scheme like a coke fiend 
 Keep brothers awake like codeine 
 'Cause when you sleep I dream deep, right? 
 Brothers better sleep light 
 'Cause I keep sight on number one, so go 'head, sleep tight 
 I put them out, conspire like I won the house 
 Things are looking up, so brothers better be looking out 
 I'm closing the gap like Heidi 
 My shits selling more than Shay Whitey 
 I'm coming for your spot nigga 
 Ain't nothing calm about the things on my mind 
 Shit, I leave here sunny 'cause I won every time 
 You had your time now it's my turn to rock 
 And let my cream rise 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I just won't stop there 
 I gotta maintain the status quo of being the baddest bro 
 The world is watching 
 Girls clocking my rhyming 
 I cracked the oyster took the pearl but can I keep it shining? 
 Too much passes the flame 
 Too much knowledge to ascertain 
 I made a mark but can I leave a lasting name? 
 Well put this in your pipe and smoke it 
 As long as I'm breathing, I keep the world open 
 I skip to the lou so don't sip the soup 
 Then get gassed 'cause then, damn, I gotta rip your crew 
 My format is all that so skip the small chat 
 If you're all that then reach for the stars nigga! 
 I recycle them bars, hot like stolen cars 
 Claim peace if anything brothers is holding off 
 I got to have it till then I won't stop 
 So many years rock bottom I gotta reach 
  
 [Hook]Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to make or break a habit. On the 22nd day, you’ve found the way. 
  
 On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a “plant-based breakfast” everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought… 
  
 Why now? There’s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day…It just feels right! 
  
 So you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress… Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don’t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We’ll see… 
  
 Best of luck and health! 
  
 P.S. B is also joining me. 
  
 I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.[Intro: Pain In Da Ass] 
 What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker 
 You a punk, I been with made people, connected people 
 Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers 
 Why don't you go get lost 
 Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin' 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You're now tuned into the greatest 
 Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us 
 Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em 
 Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder 
 Locked rap for three summers, poker faces with the aces under 
 Phase one of the takeover, the break's over 
 Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-Hovah 
 Shit knockin', almost a crime, get Cochran 
 Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand 
 Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away 
 They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride 
 If they try to plant, under the seat of my car 
 Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes 
 Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper 
 Rep ya game pros 
  
 [Verse 2: Wais P] 
 We celebrate this, while you sittin' back screamin' you hate this 
 Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix 
 Spittin' sperm inside of latex 
 You get, no respect like a child rapist 
 Delegate this, men just givin' face lifts 
 Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus 
 Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases 
 Informants, heatin' the spot up like global warmin' 
 Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic 
 Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless 
 I know you wanna see me wasted 
 You call the order, I'll be in Hell 
 Team Roc sweater and ice water 
 Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel 
 Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals 
 Y'all niggas is local but that's evident 
 I'm Resident Evil, movin' like (?) 
  
 [Verse 3: Memphis Bleek] 
 Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin' 
 I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya 
 Point the MAC at ya, *niggas* caught up 
 Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture 
 Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit 
 For the love of sex money and drugs 
 Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs 
 Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower 
 And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us 
 If you was lookin' you found us 
 Movin' with speed, tried to play Superman 
 Ended up like Chris Reeves 
 Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt 
 Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it 
 Keepin' my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's 
 Bulgin' out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded 
 Holdin', share these shots with you like a secret 
 It's like a story never told, but believe it... 
  
 [Verse 4: Sauce Money] 
 Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker 
 Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka 
 I got ya screwface in forty-two ways 
 Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire 
 "Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes 
 Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin' 
 Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin 
 Four shots spin ya like chrome rims 
 Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin' 
 White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman 
 Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny 
 *Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed 
 Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon 
 Heat-seekin', grill huntin', still frontin'? 
 Keep squeezin', *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezin' 
 No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail 
 Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Geah, there you have it 
 Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever 
 Never disrespect this thing of ours 
 Roc-A-Fella family[Intro: Puff Daddy (Jay-Z)] 
 Bad Boys 
 (Puff what up nigga? Let's go half on a boat!) 
 Come out and play 
 You know we had to do a remix right? (Me too, uh, Young!) 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 You niggas is ass, I put your ass in a bad play 
 This ain't no fair one, get rid of you the fast way 
 Ski mask way, pull hammers from the coat 
 This ain't no handgun, this shit'll sink a boat 
 (What boat?) 
 Any one in the Atlantic, the S.S. Minnow, the Titanic 
 Send a distress signal like poof 
 Red flares in the air don't matter to me 
 Send the army, coast guard, the whole faculty 
 I see and I raise you one, I raise guns like Bebe's kids 
 A Bad Boy but no I'm not Janice's, I'm Gloria's warrior 
 When I flash the tool, leave you stiff like photographers 
 Y'all don't got heart for this art of war 
 My arsenal is more awesome than yours 
 When Hov in the building niggas lost from the door 
 From the front porch 'cause I have no flaws 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all keep acting like y'all don't hear 
 I put this little red laser in your ear 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 No rap, you rat, you wack, you bore me 
 I want to end your career but you gon' do it for me 
 I'm, one of the greats 
 You know Young demand 'bout a hundred out the gate 
 For a flyer with my face (woo!) 
 I'm like Mariah with the cake 
 Lord knows 'bout to retire with Mase 
 All my broads look like Mya in the waist 
 All over the country like Shania in the face 
 I brought the pliers to the place 
 To apply pressure, I don't know how you gon' take 
 Niggas acting like they flying with a cape 
 'Til I bring 'em to Earth then they hiring the Jake 
 Monkeys can't look the lion in the face 
 The king of the jungle, nigga, did I mumble? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all keep acting like y'all don't hear 
 I put this little red laser in your ear 
 I'm saying this slow so you clear 
 I put this little red laser in your ear 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 (Is he?) Uh, I'm dead serious 
 Save them games you play for Lil' Vicious 
 I bust a deuce-deuce in your bubble goose 
 God damn, Brooklyn to Hollywood, I'm so good 
 The Roc denim jeans, uh! 
 S Dots in green, the red Roc chain 
 You gotta love it how he does it (how he do it?) 
 How I hustle a dollar then I double it 
 Y'all ain't fucking with my déjà vu 
 Y'all can't double down the way I do 
 Nigga, the Blueprint 2, I move three 
 Y'all can't move me from the number one spot 
 Run the numbers on S Dot 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 Y'all keep acting like y'all don't hear 
 I put this little red laser in your ear 
 I'm saying this slow so you clear 
 I put this little red laser in your ear, geahLondon bridges are falling down 
 Not bridges but britches when Jigga’s in town 
 Lady, show me your knickers 
 I might let you kick it if you don’t tell the missus 
 Quick, run, before the tabloids come 
 Run from the night or we end up in The Sun 
 I’m just taking the piss — unless you’re gonna do it 
 Oh Nelly’s gone so Makaveli 
 Bring two packs of condoms when you come to the tele 
 Tell me if this is true 
 If diamond’s are a girls’ best friend, my crew 
 Would like to extend an invitation to you 
 We like to invite you to 
 Our family – 
 Jewelry I mean ‘cause my jewels currently is being guarded by the queen[Intro: Tone] 
 Hawk, who goes yonder? 
 It is I, sire, Tone from Brooklyn 
 Well speak up man, what is it? 
 News from the east, sire 
 The best of both worlds has returned 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Mirror mirror on the wall 
 Whose is the freshest of them all? 
 I love 'em all, but none of y'all 
 Is Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly 
 With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all 
 We got hits like a thirty shot clip 
 When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor 
 Holla at your boy, boys 
 When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys 
 I ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's 
 Wiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change 
 Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank 
 We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain 
 We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing 
 That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
 Meeting Michelle at the hotel 
 While Jay and Tone on the way to the afterparty 
 Got the ladies sayin', oh 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Best of both worlds, and we rock the club 
 Youknowhatimsayin 
 Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing 
 Losers lose, so when we does what we do, we win 
 And win again, like deja vu 
 Then we win again, like M.J. do 
 Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue 
 Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move 
  
 [Hook 2x: R. Kelly] 
 In this arena, arena 
 All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up 
 This is for them hustlin' boys and girls 
 It's the return of best of both worlds 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Now all the ladies love Kells, cuz Kells is fresh 
 And plus, Kells got super pimp 'cross his chest 
 I got a fat gold chain and a drop top Lex' 
 And when I'm rollin' through your hood, I be causin' wrecks 
 Man I'm a gigolo, air force ones and fresh linen 
 I be in the club while my chrome still spinning 
 Ladies line up in a single filed line 
 Just to hear the black Sinatra, sing 'em a few lines like 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Best of best worlds, gettin' it down, youknawimean 
 Kells and Jigga, man, back on the set 
 Step off in the club, so fresh and so clean 
 Ladies be like, damn, bling, bling, bling 
 Hov' rapping, I sing, sing, sing 
 H to the O, and the R&B king 
 Before we do a show, it's like ching, ching, ching 
 So ladi dadi, we like to party 
 We don't start fights, we don't bother nobody 
 The good news, haters, we got a lot of dough 
 Bad news, is, it's the return of best of both 
  
 [Hook 2x] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 We on a world tour, with Jay and my man 
 Going each and every where with the mic in our hands 
 London, Paris, New York, D.C 
 Detroit, from Chitown, to Cali 
 We on a world tour, with Kells and ya man 
 Going each and every where with the mic in our hands 
 Philly, Jersey, Dallas, St. Louie 
 Miami, Best of Both, coming to your city 
  
 [Hook 2x][Jay-Z talking] 
 Uh huh 
 (scratching) "chi chi chi chilly chill" 
 This gangsta gangsta uh 
 Uh huh 
 This gangsta gangsta shit 
 "chi chi chilly chill" 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 I'm from murder murder Marcyville 
 My nigga you heard we clap you we certainly will 
 South Philly mothrfuckers kill at will 
 Bet the nine milly make you niggas "chilly chill" 
 Murder murder Marcyville 
 My nigga you heard we clap you we certainly will 
 South Philly motherfuckers kill at will 
 Bet the mack milly make you niggas "chilly chill" 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Check the four corners of the earth I'm a man of respect 
 Marcy projects motherfucker I'm demanding respect 
 The niggas done fucked up and they called in the cleaners 
 Jayo you're not a felon you're a misdemeanor 
 Don't let the Nina hit you and split your bean up 
 Fuck the punks with you we hit your team up (buck buck) 
 Y'all niggas hurtin' 
 That publicity stunt is not workin' 
 You made a bad situation worsen 
 Y'all wanna see me out this game like Rider 
 You fuckers better stop that ?we came from a game wider 
 How the fuck you gone try us? 
 You can't deny us 
 Of a dollar it's the Roc bitch holla! 
 Beef ain't nothing to a boss nigga 
 You crossed the line 
 The orders go out to kick in your doors 
 Wavin' the 4 4 
 All I heard was Jigga I don't want it no more 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Bleek] 
 Yo you heard a nigga fronted on Bleek word? 
 Nigga, never fronted on Bleek word 
 If it's written I wrote it 
 You spit it I spoke it 
 So...Never forget Bleek totin' 
 I'm from murder murder Marcyville 
 If y'all look in the mirror do y'all see real? 
 We see through your facade 
 Y'all soft like Q-tip cotton 
 Y'all dudes ain't hardly real 
 The boss spit off impulse certainly will 
 If I smack this kid you'll probably squeal 
 So open the hydro we firing steel 
 We clear out the building like a fire drill and 
 Money too long for y'all to fold 
 You know to catch a case to me is like a common cold 
 So get your guns out you ain't ready for war 
 You know the R-O-C too strong for y'all 
 Motherfucker 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Geda K] 
 Yo, I'm in a zone 
 You niggas done disturbed the peace 
 I try to relax 
 Still got word off the street 
 Hear you frail bastards tryin' to get your name back 
 You ain't achieve shit since you got your name in rap 
 We can't be misjudged you hear the flows and the lyrics and 
 The fifth slugs'll tear holes in your spirit and 
 It's like rap turned y'all to kill and hustle 
 Knowin' y'all gone snitch if I hop one touch you 
 Talk that gangsta slang be a gangsta slain 
 These N-Y-M-P gangstas bang 
 How you talk real but need your click to live? 
 All I need is the fifth and two clips to give 
 Geda keep the unsane ratchet 
 For y'all who swear y'all can dodge the rain put on your rain jackets 
 It's the game y'all ain't fit for drams with us 
 And we pop the big guns that tear through armored trucks 
  
 [Chorus][R. Kelly] 
 Make up, and break up 
 That's all we do 
 Then we have sex, next thing you know 
 Everything is cool 
 Best of Both Worlds! Holla at your boy 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Like we always do about this time 
 Uh-huh, yeah 
 I know what you doin ma 
 Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can 
 Do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing 
 I understand - c'mon! 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
 Seems we're always arguing, but 
 Right after the arguing we have, sex 
 And somehow it's the best, yes 
 Seems we're always arguing, but 
 Right after the arguing we have, sex 
 And somehow it's the best girl 
  
 [First instance of Hook - no last line] 
  
 [Jigga overlaps first instance of Hook] 
 Gangsta love, gangsta love 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Think about it while the streets you roam 
 It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home 
 Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta 
 We break up or break you off then we right back together 
 Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Herrera 
 Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather 
 Like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better 
 Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever 
 Who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words together 
 Sometimes'll make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Jay-Z over Hook] 
 Woo! 
 Boy talk boy! 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Break up to make up baby 
 Seems that's all we do darlin 
 But no one wants to walk out the door 
 After all of the holla'n 
 Cursing and fighting 
 And me sleeping on the couch 
 In the midst of our stormy weather 
 Sex brings the sun out 
 After I hit that there 
 Seems we don't have a care 
 Sex makes you say I'm sorry 
 And things like I'm not goin nowhere 
 It's somethin bout the P-U-S-S-Y 
 That keeps brother in check, even I 
 Even if you was a pimp you couldn't survive 
 Without the H-E-L-P to provide you 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Third instance of Hook - no last line] 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Think about it while the streets you roam 
 It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home 
 Remember that night? You was all like 
 Maybe we should go our seperate ways for life 
 I hit the lights fit you tight at the lil' place right 
 I hit it right you look me right in the eyes like sike 
 You was goin through your act 'til I caught you in the sack 
 And I made you relax when I (hit it hard from the back) 
 Yeah now we back friends 
 And the next time you need some sex counselin, we 
  
 [Hook] - [new last line "after we get through arguin we"] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Seems we're always arguing, but 
 Right after the arguing we have, sex 
 Sex with best friends 
 From the bathroom to the kitchen (we sex) 
 From the kitchen to living room (we sex) 
 From the living room to upstairs (we sex) 
 Upstairs to the attic (we sex) 
 Attic to the basement (we sex) 
 From the basement to the car garage (we sex) 
 Garage to the back of the Jeep (we sex) 
 Bicycle to the treadmill (we sex) 
 Even over by the dirty lawnmower (we sex) 
 The neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy (we sex) 
 I don't care because you're my baby (we sex) 
 It's our house, and we can have sex (we sex) 
 Anytime we want to (we sex) 
 They can kiss my ass, because whoa-ho-hoo 
 Hey L Don you feel me? 
  
 [L Don] 
 Yeah yeah yeah I feel you 
 You and Jay crazy man, but it's all good 
 Let's go 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 La-la-la-la-lah-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex 
 La-la-la-la-lah-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex[Intro: Meli'sa Morgan & Jay-Z] 
 'Cause you can't knock the hustle... 
 Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh 
 Foooooool's, paradise 
 Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan 
 You better think twice 
 Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop 
 'Cause it's not very nice 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 We about to change this game dear 
 Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there 
 I remain without peer, keep the lames clear 
 And the cats that's all about scratch remain here 
 On top of this Metropolis 
 My name's like a swear 
 Dropped off every tier 
 Now y'all can swear to Jay 
 Heard it the other day 
 Through the missive, peep how they script it 
 We got to hit you every night 'fore we hit the lights, it's type addictive 
 Need cash to live with, the beat goes on 
 Every day is a hustle, the heat grows on 
 Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds 
 And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old 
 Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold 
 And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes 
 And I, hope you shine 
 Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes 
 Can't knock the hustle 
  
 [Chorus 1: Meli'sa Morgan & Jay-Z] 
 I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh) 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 'Cause you can't knock the hustle, how we do 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Maybe one day you'll be a star 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Check this 
 In a man's world need a girl to touch something 
 Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something 
 If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something 
 When I get home, then it's on 
 Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs 
 Love the way you behave and beg 
 Moans, turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team 
 Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens 
 Life with me, consists of a lot of things 
 Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings 
 But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness 
 Remind them freak chicks, stay out my bizziness 
 Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage 
 Came back with six bags struggling 
 In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me 
 Steak still warm on me 
  
 [Chorus 2: Meli'sa Morgan Jay-Z] 
 You can't knock the hustle 
 But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh) 
 'Cause that's the way you're making me feel (how we, how we do) 
 The way you're making me feel (You can't knock the hustle) 
 I don't want no romance, I just want the chance 
 Can't knock the hustle for real (ha) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Ever since I retired, working alongside of live wires 
 To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars 
 I guess I'm biased 'cause what I talk about I live 
 These rap dudes conflicted 
 Some of them ain't even rapping for chips 
 What part of the game is this? 
 Seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I'm saying I miss 
 Cats that go all out for their gold plaques 
 Started with four jacks, ended up with gold Ac's 
 Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped 
 On their, way to me through you, screw you 
 Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes 
 Run through you like um, excuse you 
 But that's my cash, gotta understand your hustle 
 But that's my cash, you don't understand 
 Let my dough pass, you can show it love 
 Like a rap star in front of the club 
 But don't knock the hustle 
  
 [Chorus 1 & 2: Meli'sa Morgan & Jay-Z] 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
 But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy 
 'Cause that's the way you making me feel 
 The way you making me feel 
 'Cause you can't knock the hustle 
 I don't want no romance, I just want the chance 
 Can't knock the hustle for real 
 'Cause you can't knock the hustle[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 Back again and back again 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 As a youth I used to hold the weed up 
 Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader 
 In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up 
 Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the cheeba 
 They said believe us or not trust is something you earn 
 With every mistake you make back to us you return 
 Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was joking 
 My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smoking 
 All engulfed into honies, the pussy was tight 
 If she threw the pussy right, I got mushy like 
 Damn baby I love you take all my cash 
 "You ain't got to lie Jay," you already gettin' the ass 
 She loved that I was a thug it turned her on 
 Soon as I got soft, it turned her off 
 I got relaxed put my feet up start dissing my friends 
 And that's when the ceiling fell in 
  
 [Chorus 1: Jay-Z] 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I came through with the shines 
 Like the streets was blind 
 Didn't master my Algebra, no caliber 
 Stick me? I was thinking how and for what 
 But reality bites like a thousand mutts 
 Nothing worse than the person that's foul with guts 
 To stick you quicker... 
  
 [Verse 3: Memphis Bleek] 
 ...This brand new nigga 
 Yup, this is the foulest 
 This ain't Hollywood, it's the Wild West 
 Whoever guns is the loudest 
 That's who's the best, now take ten steps and draw 
 Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw 
 Who has no regards for the law? 
 Me that's who, now let me ask you 
 Did you not know if we all don't eat 
 Some day that we all would beef? 
 Did you know about the crabs in the barrel 
 They would hear me creep 
 It's a motherfucking war in these streets 
  
 [Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto 
 And I'm back again I'm back again 
 I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto 
 And I'm back again, I'm back again 
  
 [Chorus 1: Jay-Z] 
 From Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
 From Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
  
 [Verse 4: Sauce Money] 
 As a youth I used to fold up 
 Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier 
 Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool 
 Good cat personified even went to school 
 Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live 
 Off of nothing with this bullshit 9 to 5 
 I stayed broke made me easier to provoke 
 Ready to yoke the first motherfucker that joked 
 Same dude with the hard bottom 
 Went from laid back to loc'd out 
 From talk it over to Todd shot him 
 Ready to perish all the shit you cherish 
 Leave you the wettest I got a "You die first" fetish 
 I can recall helping old chicks across the street 
 Now I help myself lifting cats off they feet 
 Can't give a fuck nigga, I just lost my moms 
 Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms 
  
 [Chorus 3: Sauce Money] 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
  
 [Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto 
 And I'm back again, I'm back again 
 I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto 
 And I'm back again, I'm back again 
  
 [Chorus 1: Jay-Z] 
 I went from Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, back again 
 From Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, back again 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Uh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think 
 I'ma make it real easy for y'all 
 You got three different types of nigga 
 First cat, as a youth is real wild 
 For whatever reason he hit the money or whatever—cooled out 
 You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always remained ghetto 
 You know that type 
 Then, you got one cat very smart young man 
 E'rybody wanted him to be a lawyer doctor whatever 
 Pressure drove him crazy, he wiled out, ha geah... 
 ...Marcy to Hollywood 
 And back again, and back again 
 Back again, beatch[Intro] 
 Welcome to Jay Z's poetry reading 
 Halt, who goes there? 
 Do this, do this {*does poetry snaps, audience follows*} 
 It was the winter 
 It was cold 
 It was the cold winter 
 Welcome ladies and gentleman once again 
 As if we never left 
 It's MTV Unplugged 
 I'll be your host this evening 
 I go by a couple of names 
 People call me a lot of names, couple to my face you know 
 Sometimes they call me Jay Z 
 Sometimes they call me Jigga 
 Sometimes they call me Young Hov 
 Iceberg, tonight I'm 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 You gotta love that 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 I got the most incredible Roots band with me tonight y'all 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 It's a beautiful thing 
 Welcome everybody to the 8th Wonder of the world 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 The flow of the century 
 Always timeless 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 Hov 
 We gonna thank everybody for coming out 
 (H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A) 
 You could've been anywhere in the world, you're here with me 
 I appreciate that 
 Let's rock 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
 Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins, got it dirt cheap for them 
 Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them 
 I Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them 
 Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy 
 Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me 
 Haters want me clap that chrome, it ain't easy 
 Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in 
 But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 Still not guilty, he who does not feel me 
 Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist 
 So poof! (Vamoose, son of a bitch!) 
  
 [Hook] 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 Still not guilty y'all got to feel me 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I do this for my culture 
 To let them know what ya boy look like when ya boy in that Roadster 
 Show them how to move in a room full of vultures 
 Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over 
 Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up 
 I'm overcharging labels for what they did to the Cold Crush 
 Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us 
 We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks 
  
 [Hook] 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Hov is back, life stories told through rap 
 They acting like I sold you crack 
 Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that 
 So hopefully you won't have to go through that 
 I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats 
 Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa 
 Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave 
 Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk 
 Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed? 
 That's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law 
 So you know I seen it all before 
 I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight 
 To try and to fail: the two things I hate 
 Succeed in this rap game: the two things that's great 
 H O V A 
 (What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy) 
 Yeah! 
  
 [Hook] 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up! 
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 Fo sheezy my neezy keep my arms so greasyI've got so much troubles on my mind 
 Refuse to lose 
 My nephews need new shoes 
 Plus they chew food like it’s goin outta style so blaow! 
 Take that nigga four way back 
 I’m always strapped like Nike Airs 
 It’s right here 
 Under the belt and one in the hand, nigga 
 Nothin to help I’m wanted with the feds 
 Anybody killer for anybody’s scrilla 
 Anybody out there know anybody realer 
 Any amount of hunger make any nigga dealer 
 That's why in your hood they feel us 
 I don’t walk around with a gun cause it’s the style 
 I’m walkin around with one cause I ain’t tryin to miss my child 
 'Till my unborn son is born 
 I'm tryin to be around 
 'Till then, listen to the sound, blaow![JAY-Z] 
 Jay's back, asap, crowd awaits, they clap 
 Stage black, gladiator blaze from the playback 
 I take center stage, AK spray raps 
 What more can I say that I haven't said they ask 
 Covered drugs, slung crack, fatherless sons, sung about that 
 You can feel the real in every one of my raps 
 Push whips, pull chicks, side step every one of they traps 
 They tap, them Feds don't play fair 
 They pay rats to say that their 
 Part of your operation, they're the doctor you're the patient nigga 
 Open heart surgery, no anesthesia, lay back 
 No love for us bad boys, take that 
 Hey that's the chance that we take, tryin' to make that 
 Maybach seats way way back 
 Cops versus robbers and they don't play with cap guns 
 You learn that, rather young, hearing bullets whiz through your wave cap 
 Paint that, scenes don't play back 
 Everyday I wake I see a wake so I vacate where it's safe at 
 No I ain't scared, I'm just afraid that 
 I'll kill you and wind up given all this paper that I made back 
 And that ain't hot, that ain't the Jay that I know 
 He use his brain for more than a place to pull the braids at 
 I'm too high on life, way back 
 If you crave rap, shave crack, Jay's back bitches[Intro: Jay-Z] 
 (AAOOOWWWW!!!) it's so rock and roll 
 Jay skateboarder... 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 I be the king of the Roc, there is none higher 
 Fuck 'Jay-Z' - y'all should call me sire 
 I won't stop rocking 'til I retire 
 I got Lyor rich, y'all got niggas fired 
 I'm a cash cow, nigga, I'm 'bout to cash out 
 'Bout to drop The Black Album and back out 
 I ain't gotta come back out to pull that Maybach out the garage rap's my hobby, spending money's my job 
 Army in the cup (cup), Giorgio Armani special cut 
 Scooby Doo's walkin' on you mutts 
 I'm back on it the famous face with the mask on it 
 Playin' laser tag with the mag, you can not want it 
 You can get it in a New York minute 
 I draw a square and I dare you to walk in it 
 Listen, you're a square, don't get your corner bended 
 You're a circle, I will hurt you, you're a zero, I'm a hero 
 I should fear no man but God 
 Yet and still I could chill in the City of God's in Brazil 
 I'm that real was selling crack in the building 
 Back when selling crack in the building was a big deal, I'm that chill 
 It's like having ice on the face of a watch when I enter the spot time stands still 
 Ill, check out the metaphors I build 
 Made me bigger than U.S Steel, tell em' Phar-real 
  
 [Hook: Pharrell (Jay-Z)] 
 You think that you don't have to ever quit 
 You think that you can get away with it 
 You think the light won't be ever lit 
 It's almost over now (the game is Hova's now) 
 Something on your chest, better get it off 
 They'll be no one left when we set it off 
 We ain't gonna take it no more 
 Said it's almost over now (the game is Hova's now) 
  
 [Bridge: Pharrell (Jay-Z)] 
 You, can't be me, I'm a rock star 
 I'm rhymin on the top of a cop's car 
 I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far 
 (It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now) 
 I guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys 
 It's too damn late to apologize 
 When you see the mantle or will you see the skies 
 (It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now.. nigga!) 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z] 
 It's so motherfuckin' rock and roll Jay skateboarder 
 I wanna send a, special shout out to Bleek, man 
 Hahahaha, yes, Baseline Recordings 
 S Dot collection in stores 
 Black Album 'bout to change the face of music 
 (Yes, yes, yes) 
  
 [Hook: Jay-Z] 
 You, can't be me, I'm a rock star 
 Y'all rhymin' from the back of a cop car 
 Y'all pointin' niggas out like, "there they are" 
 (It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 As tough as niggas is talkin', it's no wonder I'm still walking 
 I've been runnin' New York so long I'm exhausted 
 Now fuck forfeit, nah get the fuck off it 
 Or get knock the fuck off it 
 And I'm talking to uh, fuck it you're all sick 
 And I'm fucking with you ma 'cause I don't give a fuck about your boyfriend 
 I'm spiteful, if I don't like you 
 I'm liable, to buy you, then drop you 
 I son niggas like I adopted you, deliver shots like a doctor do 
 Not the one from The Watcher 2 
 It's Young, I'm back your soldiers down 
 It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z] 
 Ha ha ha, yes! Lenny motherfucking S has just walked into the building 
 S. Carter Collection 
 Kicks is mean, Black Album in stores 
 Guru close the door on these niggas! 
 Let's go! 
 Let's go! 
 I'm out this motherfucker[Verse One] 
 The allure of breaking the law 
 Was always too much for me to ever ignore 
 I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses 
 In love with a V-Dub engine 
 Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted 
 Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist 
 My womenfriends get tennis bracelets 
 Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with 
 The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded 
 Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it 
 I put my feet in the footprints left to me 
 Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy 
 My brother hustled so - naturally - 
 Up next was me...but what perplexes me 
 Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play 
 The starring role in "Hovito's Way" 
  
 [Hook] 
 "In the valley of my world 
 You'll be my only girl" 
 Once again it's the life, Oh no! 
 "In the valley of my world 
 You'll be my only girl" 
 Once again it's the life, Oh no! 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka 
 Until I'm under the field with Hoffa...it's real 
 Peel the top up like a toupée 
 Mix the water with the soda 
 Turn the pot up, make a soufflé 
 All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way 
 I'm living proof that crime do pay 
 Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads 
 Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game 
 Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train: 
 All in the Name of Love 
 Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came 
 Over the house to take back everything that they claimed 
 Or even the worse pain is the distress 
 Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain 
 And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust 
 Now it gets tough to ever love again 
 But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name 
 To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain 
 To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes: 
 We all hustlers in love with the same thing 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse Three] 
 I'm like Pookie in New Jack, cleaned up with the roof back 
 On the other side of the tracks I produce crack 
 Still a fiend no less, for the green i just 
 Go through a thing I guess, brings out my best 
 Brings out my worse, just the gift and the curse 
 No one said it would be easy, nigga livin is work 
 It's hard to not style in the Arnage, or fuck the Arnage 
 When the Benz doors lift up from the floor 
 And every night fake willies wanna match ya ball 
 But I'm far out of reach like Abdul-Jabbar 
 I'm so into this life, you know who I are 
 Every corner, every hood, nigga ghetto superstar 
 It's the life 
  
 [Hook][Hook x2: Jay-Z] 
 When the sky falls and the earth quakes 
 We gon' put this back together 
 We won’t break 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Sak Pase, my Port-Au-Princes 
 My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses 
 Our condolences as you fightin' against this 
 We’re right by your side while we tryin' to make sense of this 
 Heavenly father help us see through these problems 
 And for those that's left, accept them into your garden 
 So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin' 
 So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them 
 God please pardon, I speak from the heart 
 It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them 
 So let's get involved with them, hand to hand with them 
 Arm to arm with them 'til they get strong again 
 When the sky falls… 
  
 [Bridge: Rihanna and Bono] 
 Can’t wait until tomorrow 
 Haiti a Mi Amor 
 Haiti, Mon Amour 
 Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone 
 Oh no 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded 
 So we know we just can’t rely on the government 
 We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when 
 When we gon' catch a break, my friend lost his mother, and then 
 And then, Carline lost her uncles and them 
 Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them 
 And the tears fall, and we fight back 
 Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that 
 Nah, not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name 
 You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us 
 You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Bono] 
 It’s not the angels that are on their way 
 Its not the bells of Santa Trinita 
 The people waiting in positions vacant 
 For hands to help not just to pray 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [French singing] 
 Haïti va s’élever 
 Tu vas te relever 
 Nous nous éléverons 
 Ensemble ensemble ensemble 
 (Not gonna leave you stranded…) 
  
 [Outro: Jay-Z]

 I can give a fuck what these rappers sayin' bout me 
 That just let's me know, they can't go a day without me 
 Scared of me succeading, that's the reason you doubt me 
 Cuz if you ain't believe me, you wouldn't be thinkin' bout me 
 Sorta how like you, never crossed my mind 
 Until you crossed the line, stop... 
 Then I gotta come accross a rhyme 
 To let the world know you come across a mime 
 I do so much sauce with lines, with someone who saws my climb 
 From Marcy to party, where you soakin' up blue nine 
 Prude, am I, got a du-lema, I'm a dude from the hood 
 Who loves jewels, who am I? 
 You where placed in the same shoes, size 10/5 
 With a sick view, of the place you grew, dude, can I 
 Live, what I did, for this whole rap circus 
 I open up more doors for y'all fuckers than car service 
 Ya'll nervous, I ain't back yet

 We're back at center court here at Reebok invitational brought to you by Jay-Z's S. Dot Carter tennis shoe set 
  
 [Announcer #2]: 
 That's right John. I hear they're available June 18th 
  
 [Announcer #1]: 
 It's a great match. (Out!) Just barely out. Things seem to be heating up on the court 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Young. Turn the music up, turn the lights down, I'm in my zone 
  
 [Verse One]: 
 Product of determination 
 One who made it through like the sperm who made him 
 I represent strength like the black mom who didn't terminate him 
 But in turn gave him her all 
 Now discussing barbershop back rooms 
 Online chat rooms and on the bathroom on the wall 
 Recall 
 I came from the bottom but the talent God gave him got him by 
 Y'all can hate him but that only made him stronger than 
 [?] Hov end his sentence 
 Know you wanna roll when the Rolls comes 20 inches nigga 
 Standard I speak Spanish to these hoes and they know 
 Dame peso, my peso is large than The Lakers' Payroll 
 But I'm the proud new owner of the Nets, no diploma 
 No regrets don't even talk about no Ruckers motherfuckers 
 I am set like a tennis match 
 See where your interest at 
 Y'all don't get the big picture yet, nigga get 
 Go get yourself a flat screen, not only on the rap scene 
 Last seen on ESPN rapping 
 Boy Hov got a hell of a pen 
 He don't put it to paper he just write in the wind 
 I know you hate him now you wasn't likin' him then 
 His paper gettin' long like IBM 
 Ey bien 
 It's all good, I see them 
 Tryin' to make a little fame off the name again 
 Advantage Carter 
 Young fuck try to catch up 
 You know the score nigga, half a Billi, love 
 Haha 
  
 [Scratches]: 
 S Dot talkin' off, come walk with me 
 If not, sit back and watch me do me 
 Just side line ballers 
 I thought I told ya 
 It's the undisputed champ-ion 
 Lookin' at them S. Dots it's about that time 
 The number one sellers since they first designed 
  
 [Interlude] [Announcer talking]: 
 Man, if things keep going like this...tennis will never be the same after June 18th! 
  
 [Verse Two]: 
 I'm ready 
 Lookin' at them S. Dots it's about that time 
 To do Michael Jordan numbers, the sneaker game is mine 
 I didn't make 'em for the ball court I made 'em to shine 
 So you can score big when you courtin' a dime 
 When niggas see me, shit they see the grind 
 You gotta be blind, you only see the shine 
 I dropped them S. Dots and in record time 
 The number one seller since they first design 
 50/50 you know how I handle mine 
 A nickle for you, give me my dime 
 Tell Paul Fireman, I got 'em on fire man 
 He ain't been this hot since A.I. was signed 
 Now a nigga talkin' to Kenyon Martin 
 Shawn Marion, shit I might be startin' 
 S Dot NBA niggas 
 Went from being in VA to signing NBA niggas 
 I hurdled every hurdle 
 Every nigga that was out of a nigga's reach with my figure of speech 
 Open the door, with my niggas with me 
 Open it more for niggas I don't knowYo, check it 
 Yo, I got slugs for snitches 
 No love for bitches 
 Puttin thugs in ditches 
 When my trigger finger itches 
 I got a rep that make police jet 
 Known to get a priest wet 
 I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat 
 Is Big L slow? Hell no 
 Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough 
 I'm known for yoking jacks 
 And beatin them with smoking gats 
 Leavin token blacks with broken backs and open caps 
 So with that bullshit, step to the rear son 
 The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one 
 Cause in a street brawl, I strike men like lightning 
 You see what happened in my last fight friend? 
 Aight then 
 I beat kids with lead pipes 
 I leave a trail of dead mic's 
 Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights 
 Old folks get mugged and raided 
 Crimes are drug related 
 And we live by the street rules that thugs created 
 Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts 
 For selling pounds of coke 
 Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat 
 I'm tellin you shit is about to get drastic soon 
 I'm quick to blast a goon 
 And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon 
 I got the looks that make your hotty stare 
 I keep a shotty near 
 It's the nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear 
 Tracks I'm know to roast 
 Until the microphone is ghost 
 Props I own the most 
 I'm leaving niggas comatose 
 Front and get your brain pinched 
 Big L will have your whole gang lynched 
 I started smoking dust and been insane since 
 This rap shit was a great gift 
 The other night some snake riffed 
 And got a hot lead face lift 
 All through high school I had braids 
 I kept mad blades 
 Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades 
 I cook the mic like a beef steak 
 Cause my techniques great 
 And I'm the nigga police hate in each state 
 Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper 
 Punk brother vamper 
 Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper 
 Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound 
 I'm from a whyle town 
 You know my style clown, so bow downJAY-Z 
  
 NBA FINALS GAME FIVE 
  
 TUNE IN. TURN UP THE VOLUME. 
  
 SUNDAY 9:15 EST[Verse 1: 50 Cent] 
 Man, I told y'all I was finna blow like C-4 
 Stunt in the G5, fly in the G-IV 
 G-Unit footwear, G apparel 
 I'm so hood 
 That blue and that white looks so good 
 Hip-hop man, we gon' take it to the next level 
 Kicks match that hat and that throwback 
 Kicks stay color coordinated, man, you know that 
 Truth is, I ain't got a jump shot, but I got a left hook 
 I don't swing golf clubs, but I sell like Garth Brooks 
 I'm hot man, I rock Reeboks, man 
 If it ain't the G-Unit, it's the S Dot, man 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 S Dot's taking off, G-IV's about to land 
 See how we cross brand 
 We boss about it, man 
 Got the sole of the old Guccis, if you upset sue me 
 If not sit back and watch me do me 
 Parking lot pimpin', sideline ballers 
 We don't sweat up the fresh, let the girls do it for us 
 The watch talk for me, drop talk for he 
 Brand new S Dots, walk with me 
 Sort of like you just scored a bucket 
 You bowlegged, you frontin', you walkin' awkwardly 
 Ho, it's nothing keep score with me 
 Give me three hot seconds 
 I'll break Reebok records[Intro: Christy Love] 
 I fucks with Hova 
 I want you to know 
 It's something about you 
 I fucks with Hova 
 I fucks with Hova 
 Trackmaster's XO 
 This remix is for you 
 Let's go! 
  
 [Pre-hook:] 
 Untouchable, unbreakable, unshakeable, (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable 
 Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby) 
  
 I got another one! 
 This is ludicrous! It's preposterous! It's impeccable! 
 Yes... (Remix!) Yes... Yes... Baby (it's Hova) 
  
 [Verse 1:] 
 First I had streets, then I had the charts 
 First I had they ear, now I have their heart 
 Rappers came and went, I been here from start 
 I see them put it together, watch them take it apart 
 See the rovers roll up with the ribbons 
 I see them repo, resold, and redriven, so when I reload 
 Leave holes, The number one positions, when you hot I'm hot 
 And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling 
 It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me 
 Cuz I'm gonna be that nigga for life 
 Oh this is not a gimmick 
 This is God given, this is hard livin' 
 Mixed with cristal sippin 
 This is the most consistent (Hov!) 
 Give me the most hits that you can fit inside a double disc 
 Homie I'm home on these charts, you niggas visitin' 
 This Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap 
 I'm about to claim pole position 
 Holla at ya boy! 
  
 [Hook:] 
 Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable 
 Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable 
 Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby) 
 Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable 
 Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby) 
 Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... Baby (it's Hovi) 
  
 [Verse 2:] 
 I'm so far ahead of my time 
 I'm about to start another life 
 Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice 
 Back to the future, got it slow for the present 
 I'm fast, dude can't get past my past 
 How do you propose deal with the perfect present 
 When I unwrap "The Gift & the Curse" with a different verse 
 And I'm so far ahead of my time 
 My grandpop just met my grandmom at a high school prom 
 And I'm so far ahead of my time 
 These rhymes is waiting 
 Till four years later, they on time release 
 He'll probably take them, cop your four copy 
 You realise that every track needed a autopsy 
 The more tracks I'm on, the more I catch bodies 
 If not, listen further, you're missing a murder 
 Like NYPD, LAPD, NYDA, OJ's Jury(Yep!) 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3:] 
 Crush linen, what's winning 
 If it ain't him in the flesh, continue to guess 
 I'm about to retire my jersey, fuck Mitchell and Ness 
 I'ma throwback old school kicks in the Vet 
 Sixty-nine, yeah, same year I was born 
 Flip the numbers, yeah, same year I got on 
 Ninety-six, yeah, I used to rhyme with the Don 
 Shout out to Big, Brooklyn I got this shit 
 Here is something haters can't figure out 
 Half a milla first week, man they still jigga'd out 
 See, I even sell CD's in the crowd 
 The hardest dude out since Reasonable Doubt 
 Hovi Baby, love me, or blow me baby 
 Fuck you, you'll pay me to owe me baby 
 They're in denial 
 Check the charts, I'm wearing you out 
 I'm about to drop The Black Album in a year 
 And I'm out 
  
 [Hook]Beanie Mack 
 Rocafella y'all 
 Check 
 Check 
  
 A yo two decades, three years and still in order 
 I done stabbed sticks, killed bricks drowned drops of water 
 Ate a million dollars 
 Shitted four million quarters 
 Stuck mothers, sisters, aunt, nieces and daughters 
 Fuck Taco Bell 
 I run south of the border 
 Cop a whole pie and you working wit a quarter 
 Stay cased up like my man Rhyme Slaughter 
 Sleep in crack spots on off that water 
 Y'all scrape up for weed money and grub 
 Me and my man roll in a Benz four dub 
 On our way to the club 
 Smoking weed out the jug 
 While most stay in court trying to plead with the judge 
 What! 
 Fist and wrist stay glitered up 
 Don pee sip it up to I spit it up 
 I fuck bitches who bust checks to flood my neck 
 Give me rough sex 
 Huff wet 
 Bust teks 
 Feds eyeing, like I'm imported that shit 
 I trying to be cased up in court for that shit 
 I just want to breeze through sported that shit 
 Laughing at them Point Breeze niggas snorting that shit 
 Y'all niggas would never finish that y'all be starting 
 Never could back up that shit y'all be talking 
 I make you famous 
 I put your face on milk cartons 
 Beenie Mack smoother than Jerome on Martin 
 I keep the silence on the three eighty loughton 
 Quiets the bus but can't do shit about this sparking 
 That's why I get my bodies right before darken 
 Your dogs ain't biting shit, just doing a lot of barking 
 Your squads leaking 
 Fronting like y'all eating 
 Rent a little car get dress on the weekend 
 That that Joe shit 
 You don't know me why you speaking? 
 Cause I shut down blocks and clock like Puerto Ricans 
 Beenie Mack rap gorilla 
 I'm out for the scrilla 
 Face it ain't no replacement for this killer[Intro]

 [Verse 1] 
 You know I, thug em, hug em, love em, leave em 
 But I don't trust or need em 
 Take em out the hood, keep em looking good 
 With diamond clusters that I'm freezing 
 First time they fuss I'm breezing 
 Talking bout, what's the reasons 
 I'm a pimp in every sense of the word mama 
 Better trust and believe em 
 In the cut where I keep em 
 Til I need a what, til I need to beat it up then it's 
 Then it's "beep beep" and I'm picking them up 
 Let em play with the crick in the truck 
 Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs 
 Divorce him and split his bucks 
 Just because you got good sex, I'mma break bread 
 So you can be living it up 
 Part with nothing, I be fronting 
 Me give my heart to a woman 
 Not for nothing, never happen 
 I'll be forever macking 
 Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion, I got no patience 
 And I hate waiting, ho get your ass in and let's ride

 MTV jam of the week 
 Made my money too long for gamblin' with me but I'm 
 But I'm still sitting on BLADES hitting on crays 
 Sitting on the corner of my block hustling 
 Getting off K's, double what I paid 
 Getting it right through customs 
 It'll sell by night its egg shell white 
 I got so many grams if the man find out 
 It will land me in jail for life 
 But I'm still big pimping, spending cheese 
 With B.U.N. B, Pimp C, and Timothy 
 We got chickens in the back of the truck, laughing it up 
 Jigga Man: that's what's up

I gotta do all kind of things, Reasonable Doubt, Volume 1 Volume 2, Volume 3, Volume 4, Volume 5. Blueprint 1 the Blueprint 2 baby. Want some water? Sure sure. Hold on. It's kinda warm you wanna share? Wow. It's a beautiful thing. Ok[Verse 1] 
 First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up 
 Somebody got a problem with Hov' 
 What's up? Cats all fed up cause I got a little cheddar 
 And my record's movin' out the store? 
 Young cats gettin' at me, young rappers spittin' at me 
 My homie Big predicted this thing exactly 
 "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"- gotta move carefully 
 Cause cat hate when you getting money like athletes 
 Young'ns ice-grilling me, ohh - you not feeling me? 
 Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind 
 Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting 
 Sensitive thugs, they all need hugs 
 Damn little man I'm just trying do me 
 If the record's two mil you know I'm trying move three 
 Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E 
 Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage 
 I don't want much, yo I drove every car 
 Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers 
 Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all 
 I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing 
 Where's the love? 
  
 [Hook (Jaguar Wright)] 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of the city) 
 I said where's the love? 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of town) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And then the Fugees gonna break up, now everyday I wake up 
 Somebody got something to say 
 What's all the fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more 
 And I pack heat like I'm the oven door? 
 They pray and pray on my downfall 
 But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball 
 Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys 
 Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy 
 Look scrapper I got nephews to look after 
 I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya 
 I thought I told you cats I'm not a rapper 
 Can I live? I told you in '96 
 That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz 
 I scramble like Randall with his 
 Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam 
 Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love? 
  
 [Hook (Jaguar Wright)] 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of the city) 
 Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love? 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of town) 
 Everybody let's take em to church 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of the city 
 Ain't no love, in the heart of town) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up and Ike and Tina 
 Turner 
 Break up then I wake up to more bullsh 
 You knew me before records, you never disrespected me 
 Now that I'm successful you'll pull this sh 
 Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss 
 Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all of y'all 
 Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait 
 What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight? 
 Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates 
 Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie? 
 Nigga respect the game, that should be it 
 What you eat don't make me sh - where's the love? 
  
 [Hook] 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of the city) 
 I said where's the love? 
 (Ain't no love, in the heart of town) 
 (I said it ain't no) 
 Ain't no 
 (I said it ain't no) 
 Ain't no

 [Outro] 
 Everybody give it up for Jagwar Wright come on 
 That's all you baby that's all you 
 That's all Jay 
 Yeah right[Verse 1: My Chemical Romance] 
 When I was a young boy 
 My father took me into the city 
 To see a marching band 
 He said, "Son, when you grow up 
 Would you be the savior of the broken 
 The beaten and the damned?" 
 He said, "Will you defeat them 
 Your demons, and all the non-believers 
 The plans that they have made?" 
 "Because one day I'll leave you 
 A phantom to lead you in the summer 
 To join the black parade." 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z] 
 They say "they never really miss you til you dead or you gone" 
 So on that note, I'm leaving after the song 
 So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long 
 At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on 
 I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves 
 Who made love under the sycamore tree, which makes me 
 A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim 
 At 10 pounds, when I was born I didn't give her no pain 
 Although through the years I gave her her fair share 
 I gave her her first real scare 
 I made up for birth when I got here 
 She knows my purpose wasn't purpose 
 I ain't perfect, I care 
 But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear 
 Now I'm just scratching the surface cause what's buried under there 
 Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared 
 I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted 
 But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted 
  
 [Hook: My Chemical Romance] 
 He said, "Son, when you grow up 
 Would you be the savior of the broken 
 The beaten and the damned?" 
 He said, "Will you defeat them 
 Your demons, and all the non-believers 
 The plans that they have made?" 
 "Because one day I'll leave you 
 A phantom to lead you in the summer 
 To join the black parade." 
  
 [Verse 3: JAY-Z] 
 Now all the teachers couldn't reach me 
 And my momma couldn't beat me 
 Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, so 
 With that disdain in my membrane 
 Got on my pimp game 
 Fuck the world, my defense came 
 Then DeHaven introduced me to the game 
 Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine 
 I'm a hustler now 
 My gear is in and I'm in the in crowd 
 And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now 
 My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag 
 Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged 
 Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had 
 Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass 
 I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap 
 But that came second to me moving this crack 
 Gimme a second, I swear 
 I will say about my rap career 
 Til '96 came, niggas I'm here 
 Good-bye 
  
 [Hook: My Chemical Romance] 
 He said, "Son, when you grow up 
 Would you be the savior of the broken 
 The beaten and the damned?" 
 He said, "Will you defeat them 
 Your demons, and all the non-believers 
 The plans that they have made?" 
 "Because one day I'll leave you 
 A phantom to lead you in the summer 
 To join the black parade." 
  
 [Verse 4: JAY-Z] 
 Good-bye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush 
 Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush 
 And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch 
 No two days are alike 
 Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much 
 And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us 
 Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up 
 And the drought will define a man when the well dries up 
 You learn the worth of water without work, you thirst til you die, yup! 
 And niggas get tied up for product 
 And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up 
 To show mothers they really got em 
 And this was the stress I lived with till I decided 
 To try this rap shit for a living 
 I pray I'm forgiven 
 For every bad decision I made 
 Every sister I played 
 Cause I'm still paranoid to this day 
 And it's nobody's fault I made the decisions I made 
 This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me 
  
 [Outro: My Chemical Romance & (JAY Z)] 
 (If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack 
 Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black) 
  
 When I was a young boy 
 My father took me into the city 
 To see a marching band 
 He said, "Son, when you grow up 
 Would you be the savior of the broken 
 The beaten and the damned?" 
 He said, "Will you defeat them 
 Your demons, and all the non-believers 
 The plans that they have made?" 
 "Because one day I'll leave you 
 A phantom to lead you in the summer 
 To join the black parade."Uhh, y'all know what this is 
 Now would be a good time to start bobbin your heads 
 Kels, and it, and it, uhh 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Excuse me miss, don't mean to interrupt 
 But you're the hottest chick in this club 
 The way you shake your ass to this beat 
 It's like your booty got dancin feet 
 I wanna take you home, in my Hummer Jeep 
 All over me while you ridin the beep beep 
 I just really wanna taste your ice cream 
 It's the weekend baby I got the {?} 
 Go on girl, the way you do me 
 This is somethin like a fantasy 
 You're that girl from the magazine 
 BET, or, MTV 
 So baby let me take you to my ecstasy 
 Pull up to the club on them 23's 
 Girl you've got that shit in your hip 
 That make me wanna spend, money 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
 Pretty girls (where you at) 
 I'm talkin to the ones, that came alone 
 Pretty girls (put your hands up) 
 The single ones, we wanna take you home - c'mon 
 Pretty girls... (you make me wanna shout) 
 Let's, go! 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Whether you tall like Lisa Leslie 
 Or short like the barrel on that baby 380 
 Pretty lady, I got a ride to fit yo' frame 
 From the Coupe to the big Mercedes 
 {?}, these groundhogs stay with the cash 
 And the black card don't got no max 
 Fall, back, blow on some Merikesh hash 
 With more Manolos than Sarah Jess' had 
 How you gon' go back to dudes with little sacks 
 Little kiddie chromes in they itty bitty homes 
 Fuckin up your lungs, puffin that homegrown 
 You should be with us, cuttin in Hong Kong 
 Straight shots of Catron or Dom Perignon 
 Guys your girls say Shawn very long 
 So if you ain't afraid of catchin a love jones 
 Get with Coach Dean Smith, bitch get in the zone, c'mon 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Tell me what you're drinkin at the bar ma 
 I'm gonna buy ma, anybody tell you youse a star ma 
 You remind me of my car ma, no ignition 
 I start the Coupe up from the kitchen 
 My pretty girls get plenty attention 
 When it come to sex get plenty of inches 
 We shop, like we all broke detention 
 Club like we at a alcoholic's convention 
 Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it 
 Mama got down like the flo' when she did it 
 Pretty girls, keep shakin ass now mama 
 This party is not over 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 What's your name, what city you represent ma 
 Where the hands on all the pretty girls ma 
 For the players and the hustlers in the club now 
 And all my niggas that be sippin pimp juice now 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 Uhh, uhh, yes sir! 
 Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh 
 Y'all niggas got me really confused out there 
 I make Big Pimpin' or Give it 2 Me one of those 
 They hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century 
 I make some thought provokin' shit 
 Y'all question whether he fallin' off 
 I'ma really confuse y'all on this one... follow! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down 
 Like when them shots come out, make cops come around 
 When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town 
 Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds 
 Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out 
 The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out 
 "That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout 
 Either what chick he wit', or his chip amount 
 'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out 
 Watchin' Erik Estrada 
 Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder 
 A/C broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour 
 Spike Lees everywhere, game or the flight 
 You might see me anywhere, a day in the life 
 Only thing changed the tail number on the flight 
 I can touch down and take off the same night 
 I'm so bossy, bitch get off me 
 Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me 
 I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees 
 Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This is that ignorant shit you like 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you love 
 Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you need 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon 
 I'm only tryin' to give you what you want 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards 
 Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers 
 They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice 
 So don't believe everything your earlobe captures 
 It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me 
 And everything said in song you happen to see 
 Then, actually, believe half of what you see 
 None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me 
 And with that said, I will kill niggas dead 
 Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs 
 I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell 
 Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa! 
 This ain't B.R., no, it's S.C. CEO 
 The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world 
 And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I got that ignorant shit you like, nigga 
 I don't give a fuck, plus ass and ice, nigga 
 I got that gangsta shit you love 
 Nigga, bang out, brains out, money and drugs 
 I got that ignorant shit you need, nigga 
 Hydro, Blueberry, bomb ass weed, nigga 
 I got that project shit you want 
 Nigga, dope fiends OD, you love it don't front! 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I'm so bossy, bitch get off me 
 Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me 
 I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees 
 Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me 
  
 [Break: Singing quietly] 
 Excuse me bitch, fuck your name 
 Can you come, can you gimme some brain? 
 When you're done, can you please get the fuck out of my sight? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I built an ark, mami, cry me a river 
 Blacken my heart by puttin' light liquor in the liver 
 Put my all in the part that spreads apart now I'm back together 
 Young Goldie, The Mack forever 
 Heard they love it when I'm hard on hoes 
 Said a G don't give a bitch no keys or security codes 
 I agree, my lady ain't no bitch, she gets whatever I own 
 So when you see her, understand that's me, nigga 
 Understand I'm the same OG, nigga 
 I know the difference 'tween a bitch and a B, nigga 
 ...trick get off me, you can't get shit off me 
  
 [Chorus] 
 This is that ignorant shit you like 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you love 
 Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon 
 I got that ignorant shit you need 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon 
 I'm only tryin' to give you what you want 
 Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front! 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I'm so bossy, bitch get off me 
 Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me

 Hello, it's Hova 
 That's right youngin, the wait is over 
 The new millennium is upon us, the album is here 
 Before we get into this shit let's get a few things clear 
 Rappers with no relation, that's 7 degrees of separation 
 And I'm Kevin Bacon 
 This is the murderous version 
 Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person 
 Hova the god, I should be rapping with a turban 
 Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him 
 Mike Jordan of rap, outside j workin' 
 Now watch how quickly I drop 50 
 I don't like playin', niggas can't stick me 
 Niggas cannot jam me, niggas can't get me 
 Slimmie at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me 
 I consistently take 'em out the park like Ken Griffey 
 Do you believe? It's Hova the god ... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Well I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump 
 I'm cancer to The Hamptons 
 $20 million of guap, ransacking mansions 
 Increase the noise pollution soon as I land in 
 Don't even trust uppity white folk, keep the cannon tucked 
 Niggas try to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up 
 Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understanding much 
 I hustled for the ducats, well now I hustle for the rush 
 Like fuck it, baby, I just love it 
 Chicks now, say they like the way I thug it 
 Since my album dropped, my stock rose ... like I went public 
 Ladies, I love y'all, but I love my freedom more 
 I love my niggas, love to see them ball 
 I love Beans and Bleek 
 Them niggas like my Peter and Paul 
 My disciples 
 And that's right, we're coming for the title 
 Do you believe? It's Hova the god ... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Whoever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game? 
 Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane 
 Duckin' the plain cops, pushing indo and 'cane 
 At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain 
 First album, niggas loved me 'cause they thought I was poor 
 Guess I'm successful, industry don't love me no more 
 But I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw 
 Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touching the floor 
 And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards 
 T-shirt with my chain out, like fuck y'all all 
 Retrospect, ain't been the same since I lost my dad 
 He's still alive, but still, fuck you, don't cross my path 
 A&Rs had me feelin' like Moss in the draft 
 So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt 
 Get your CDs out 
 Let's go song for song 
 I'm the illest nigga doing it 'til y'all prove me wrong 
 Do you believe? 
 It's Hova the god ...[Intro: Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)] 
 Picture all the possibilities 
 (Ok) 
 Picture all the possibilities 
 (This is so soulful) 
 Sounds like a love song 
 Sounds like a love song 
 (Most incredible baby) 
 Yeah yeah 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 I can't see 'em coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food 
 Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move 
 We was together on the block since free lunch 
 We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch 
 We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather 
 Now we travel first class to change the forecast 
 Never in bunches, just me and you 
 I loved your point of view cause you held no punches 
 Still I left you for months on end 
 It's been months since I checked back in 
 We're somewhere in a small town, locking the mall down 
 Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down 
 I can understand why you want a divorce now 
 Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it 
 Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with 
 But deep inside you know I'm so sick right 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 I can't see 'em coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I know I see it coming down your eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I can't it coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 On repeat, the CD of BIG's "Me and My Chick" 
 Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit 
 Empty gun in your hand saying, "Let me see that clip" 
 Shopping sprees, pull out that Visa quick 
 You know I had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip 
 You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6 
 We was so happy poor but when we got rich 
 That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped 
 Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that sh 
 Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it 
 It was the cheese helping chickens get amnesia quick 
 I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me 
 Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me 
 Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy 
 And then they got fuzzy and they don't remember that 
 And I don't remember you, you, you 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 I can't see 'em coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I know I see it coming down your eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I can't it coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone 
 Word back home is that you had a special friend 
 So what was oh so special then 
 You have given away without getting at me 
 That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me 
 How was I to know that you was plain sick of me? 
 I know the way a nigga living was whack 
 But you don't get a nigga back like that! 
 Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do sh like that 
 You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that 
 You don't throw away what we had, just like that 
 I was flirting with them girls, I was gon' get right back 
 They say you can't turn a bad girl good 
 But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever 
 I mourn forever, shit 
 I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 I can't see 'em coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I know I see it coming down your eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I can't it coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
  
 [Outro: Jay Z (Mary J Blige)] 
 Let's break it down 
 This song right here is for real, for all the hustlers right 
 Who had a girlfriend, and started off, their whole relationship started off you know, he did what he had to do for them, you know what I mean? 
 But along the way he got lost.  Fast cars, fast money, you know the story 
 Trust me, he's right here. Alright. Do believe it. On the real son 
 Uh 
 Can't see it coming down my eyes 
 But I gotta make this song cry 
 Can't see it coming down my eyes 
 But I gotta make this song cry 
 I know I see it coming down your eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 I can't it coming down my eyes 
 So I gotta make the song cry 
 (Yeah. I said loving you, I said I need you) 
 Uh Uh 
 Uh Uh uhuh 
 I got lost for a second I ain't gonna lie 
 I was in my own thoughts for real 
 Alright let's get it all the way to ten, where my man Dame 
 Dame over there? I know Dame over there somewhere. Where you at. You gotta stand up for this 
 We breaking the rules 
 Camera blocking smamera smocking 
 I gotta bring up one of the most hottest producers in the last 2 years he's been on fire, he's always been on fire but he';s really been on fire. I wanna bring my man Pharrell up, come up Pharrell. I found my man Dame too. Pharrell you wanna help me out on this one? 
 This man right here is the producer behind the next joint, like 150 new ones on the radio right now 
 Yeah man you gotta dance, we gonna dance too 
 Let's go y'all[Jay-Z] 
 Everything ain't hardcore you know 
 I can't sing but my man 
 I'mma let my man smooth that thang out for you 
 You know, take the edge off, you know what I'm sayin'? 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 All my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high 
 And all my real playas throw ya hands up high 
 And just keep on bouncin' while I take you on a ride 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
 It's like your body's on radio I'm feelin' you in stereo 
 Put me in your cd player I'm gonna hit it nice and slow 
 Baby I'm your hot mix bumpin' in your cherry Lex 
 Checkin' out your widescreen while your hands up on the headrest 
  
 [Verse 1: R. Kelly] 
 I'm, in the studio thinkin' about my next hit song 
 Tryin' to come up with a melody that will turn you on 
 On the MPC3000 tryin' to come up with beats 
 That'll make come on over here and lay down here with me 
 I'm searchin' for that special mind blowin' melody 
 And it's gotta be sexy so I'll think it through carefully 
 It's like I'm tryin' to tune it, to ya station babe 
 Try to get you to play, this record babe 
 Every time I hear this track girl I think about me and you 
 In the Maybach doin' what we do 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: R. Kelly] 
 Um, now I know a few friends of mine that has made love to this record 
 So when you're in the mood call the station, request this record 
 She walks in the room, says "'Ly I can't breathe" 
 As I try to catch my breath and proceed 
 Lookin' at yo' sexy smile, while I put my vocals down 
 Girl you have made this song a hit in each and every town 
 You a sexy melody with a touch of freakin' harmony 
 Such a perfect chemistry 
 Girl we deserve a Grammy, or Soul Train 
 Billboard, MTV or BET award 
 Rollin' like we on a tour 
 Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it 
 Sex was so good girl we've got to do the remix 
 Cause girl you a mix master 
 When it comes to pumpin' you such a ghetto blaster 
 It's such a hit that I gotta bootleg it, yeah 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 A melody is the chemistry, the way we click 
 It's like four part harmony and all that shit 
 Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit 
 Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit 
 We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a loop 
 Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to 
 All these different dudes, huggin' and kissin' you, fuck! 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [R. Kelly] 
 Yeah, I'm feelin' you in stereo 
 Aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah[Verse 1] 
 As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage 
 And no one don't have it, I get it together like a marriage 
 I see you know rappers, I'm on my Ps and Qs and carrots 
 Y'all don't understand well goddamn, don't y'all know my status? 
 I'm flowin' the baddest, the baddest, I'm the baddest 
 No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters 
 When suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow 
 You're thinkin' it's hollow, the rhythm is rough and r-rugged to follow 
 It hit you like bam biggity bam bam biggity bam 
 The kid is a wizard, I'm definitely destined to make 8 digits 
 Met up with G Rap on the road to riches 
 As soon as I step up, will never remember 
 Whatever I touch, whatever I touch you know I'm gonna injure 
 That nigga don't play, hey, that nigga'll slay 
 So wiggle away, hey, you gotta dig that nigga Jay 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm the greatest MC, I'm the greatest MC in the world 
 I'm the greatest MC, I'm the greatest MC in the world 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I be thorough in every borough, my name be ringin' 
 With drug slingin' and doin' my thing and fuck that 
 Boot-knockin' so lady be jockin', my money be flippin' 
 I see you peekin' when I'm freakin', nigga stop rippin' 
 I got the ideal skills for real 
 6 digits before I had a deal, son chill 
 Who's that? With a tip of the melodramatic the crew's back 
 I [?] the way I dos that 
 Better at rippin' it, flowin', kickin' the fly shit 
 For [?] I'm givin' a bit of advice, slice 
 Don't even try that shit 
 I got skills 'til it's unreal 
 Broken down, I'm speedin' it up to 180 thousand trillion mil' 
 So what it was said about a brotha bein' as nice as me 
 Y'all know that shit is dead, right? That shit is dead 
 Why ask why when the shit sound this fly? 
  
 [Hook] x2 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Here I come, ag-ga-ga-gain, I run up-up-up-in 
 Niggas who don't do duckin', I will bu-buck and, fuck it I'm wild 
 Budda-boo-boom-boom-bam 
 What you niggas gonna do to the man? 
 I see you brought your little crew, and? 
 I'm still comin' with velocity, check it out 
 Jidday Idday Whiddy Ziddy, eh-heh! 
 And any you clowns fuckin' around 
 Ain't none of you clowns stand your ground 
 With the crown prince of the underground 
 Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now, the heat's on 
 Sweat now, Jay Z's on, be gone to the next town 
 Punks jump up to get beat down, check it out, check it out, check it out 
 Ladies be comin' [?] now 
 This kid got skills 
 It's a pity the way I'm rippin' rugged rhythm through the city 
 Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-di-di 
 I got rhythm, I, hit 'em with rhythm, I 
 Hit 'em and split 'em, I did 'em, I get rid of them guys 
 J-A, baby, baby, please give me Ps 
 Baby baby, with crazy ease 
 While Jay Z get crazy cheese 
 I take a break then I slay, never bring in my way 
 I'm cuttin' your shit short, hey, alright 
  
 [Hook] x2Brooklyn, and we don't quit 
 It’s like this yo, and we don’t stop 
 Jay-Z, Rock Jockey, check it: 
 I get deep and dark like ditches 
 But when I rap, I come off 
 Like death without the glitches 
 Never crossed the black cat 
 With the riches, I’m leaving 
 Stevie, saying "no Wonder you’re superstitious" 
 Beef, I’m with it, simple 
 Ya’ll can all get it.. 
 Ya’ll don’t all get it 
 Don’t nobody of mind for this matter 
 Can gather the data 
 Until your mind don’t matter 
 I bubble like lather 
 Hustle like the lead-off batter 
 Cause all that matters is the money 
 Til it ain’t funny, you feel me? 
 When the beast screams "kill me" 
 Don’t jerk me boy, I rip it silly 
 I’ll let you rise, of course 
 But if you don’t fall off on your own 
 MC's, I cut off at the knees like shorts 
 It gets worse - if you don’t care 
 For my sick thoughts like a nurse 
 With no known remedy 
 I’m leaving boys and men 
 On "bended knee" til "the end of the road" 
 I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale 
  
 Yo, pardon me.. 
  
 Check it out: 
 The nerve of these herbs 
 Ya’ll know who swerve 
 From the curb in the LEX 
 The best observe 
 I’m splashing, splurging 
 Dashing, that’s my word, you know? 
 Champagne glass is crashing, can’t ration 
 Used to having a whole lot 
 So dough - I blow a lot 
 Had a buck fifty while 
 You were still taking Skippy to school 
 Ran with one of them cats 
 That hides Tiffany’s for them jewels 
 Back when Duke was jumping 
 Out of cabs in Krush Groove 
 I was scheming and plotting mostly 
 Dreaming alive, but look what it got me.. 
 Four cars and four hundred thousand shots later 
 You know what I mean? 
  
 Trying not to curse, you know? 
 Trying not to curse up in this piece..[Intro] 
 Uh huh, uh huh 
 Roc-a-fella y'all 
 Turn my headphones up 
 Hip-hop y'all 
 Turn my headphones up 
 Be high y'all 
 Turn the headphones up 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Jigga man huh 
 Big freak y'all 
 Jigga man huh 
 You know what I do 
 I remove your roof homie let the sun shine in 
 Thirty eight waist enough to keep one nine in 
 Really a thirty six without the gun I'm thin 
 But when the gat is tucked I'm fat as fuck 
 Ignorant bats I'm taking y'all back to day one 
 No kids but trust me I know how to raise a gun 
 Niggas that think I spend my days in the sun 
 Well here's the shock of your life the Glock not the mic 
 How you gonna talk about MCs on my heel 
 I just copped that thing homie, the chrome wheels 
 Both arms is chunky, the sleeves on chill 
 Any given time's a hundred g's in your grill 
 Don't talk to me about MC's got skills 
 He's alright, but he's not real 
 Jay Z's that deal, I be's in the field 
 Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel 
 You gotta flow that's cool with me 
 You gotta little dough that's cool with me 
 You gotta little car little jewelry 
 But none of y'all rappers can fool with me 
 You know the wrist's frostbit minus two degrees 
 About as blue as the sea the way I maneuver the beat 
 Can't see his eyes who could it be? 
 With that new blue Yankee on, who but me? 
 Yeah I blew, few million than I blew to three 
 Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour 
 Came back and it's plain 
 Rappers ain't rapping the same 
 Their flow they jacking my slang 
 I seen the same shit happen to Kane 
 Three cuts in your eyebrows trying to wild out 
 The game is mine I'll never foul out 
 Y'all just better hope I gracefully bow out 
  
 [Instrumental Change] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You know I'm heavy on your mind 
 You know it's annoying the fact 
 This wristband over my forearm the Jordan of rap 
 Twenty three of y'all MCs that's recording is crap 
 And I would name names but they ain't as important to that 
 Yeah, yeah, Jigga man huh 
 Yeah yeah, I come through getting money, sitting on twenties 
 Homies throwing me shade ain't shit sunny 
 Hot shell all that them niggas can get from me 
 Cocktails thrown in your living room, boom 
 I'm so confrontational 
 They should have never let me out on probation yo 
 I'm a hustler, accept that 
 No correctional facilities can correct that 
 I took a step back I viewed myself 
 See where my head was at 
 It's where that dough is homie I gotta get that 
 Gotta get away some tried to head back 
 Three smart niggas got left back 
 Some died but left stacks 
 Me I balled right, and on top of that I'm dog nice 
 Jigga been cold as fuck before ice 
 Not before Christ, but a long time homie 
  
 [Instrumental Change] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 You know me, you know me 
 Yeah, poppin' Chrissy 
 Buck sixty through the gothic city 
 I'm in the back, got my partner's with me 
 Who do you trust (sirens) got to get him 
 Of my CDs, 'Pac, and Biggie 
 'Face and Juvie, looking at her face, she cutie 
 Perfectly, this perfect booty 
 She wanna hear Ma$e 
 I pull up to the store in front of Sam Goody 
 I hop out, I throw her my hoodie 
 I don't hate, chick carried work for me from state to state 
 It's the least I could do 
 Order LL too 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Haha, keep that 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 I put the car in drive baby let's go 
 Through the traffic lights, fuck traffic at night 
 We here having the time of the life 
 Little party bullshit me off guard? not hardly full clip 
 This chicks the black barbie, my car be 
 In the robbery, p-o-r-t 
 I'm a heartbeat away from deep thinking 
 It's just the clarise 
 Close my eyes can you see me thinking? 
 Can you see the chick panicking when she see how we drinking 
 Mind full of intoxings my thoughts shadow boxing 
 Demons struggling, tryna figure lifes meaning 
 Have I truly arrived or am I somewhere in between 
 I mean I got my niggas, got my chick that pull triggers with me 
 I got my (shh) outside of the city 
 I'm just coming to terms with the night they killed Biggie 
 And I sold 5 million records damn I'm pretty 
 Now one has to wonder has he lost his hunger 
 But niggas rest assured I'm even rawer than before[Hook:]: [Pharell] 
 Spin around ma 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 Spendin money mang 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 Spin around mommy 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 Drop, drop, like it's hot 
 I got the rollie on my arm 
 And I'm pourin saun dan 
 And I roll the best weed 
 Cause I got it goin on 
  
 [Verse: 1 - Pharrell] 
 No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching 
 Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen 
 You niggas is scratchin, my niggas is itchen 
 Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons" 
 Yes, nigga, P stands for polish 
 None of y'all is fuckin with he, and this is obvious 
 I'm Ron Artest, layin down to your garbage 
 While my niggas in the street pushin shit like Ben Wallace 
 And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands 
 These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man 
 I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio 
 Everything is grand? Nothing is poquito 
 Securitys behind me, with the torpedo 
 Cause the wrist stay frigid 
 How you say it? Frio 
 Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill 
 And the ends also quarter million for each whe-el 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 2 - Jay-Z] 
 I got haters on my jiz-ock, plus the fricking ciz-ops 
 All of whom want to hit me with shiz-ots til I dri-zop 
 Thank God for hip hop, or I be in the bizz-ox, uh 
 Jail or casket, either way you rizz-ock 
 But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a ziplock 
 Mr S. D-izz-ot, it's not gon' stizz-op 
 Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past 
 Too cool for ciz-ops to cuff his iz-ass 
 Snitch-ass they made, they can't get the boy 
 These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store 
 Running to the DA, tryna get me for it 
 All the money it made, I'm like "Forget the law" 
 I'm not 'fr-iz-aid, it J-iz-ay homie you got pl-iz-ayed 
 Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the stiz-age (go sit down) 
 Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S. Dot, tell ya lawyer 
 "Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot!" 
  
 [Hook:] 
  
 [Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg] 
 ((World Wide)) 
 International, nah I'm universal 
 But you a gangsta, how you get to do commertials? 
 With them big wheels, yeah cuz you do it big 
 I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is 
 I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk 
 They want beef? Yeah cuz, pop the trunk 
 We go all the way, we do it lifesize 
 Now my life right, cause my wife on my right side 
 Yeah, and she protecting my interest 
 Now I'm on the move they got me hoppin' these fences 
 Ay little homie your defence is defencless 
 A pimp apprentice 
 Now come here princess (Come here, come here)

 It really don't matta it's like a seesaw platter 
 I check money, check niggas, check bitches 
 Now drop it like you ass on swit-ches [Ziip] 
  
 [Hook:][Intro] 
 We gonna go through a couple of things tonight 
 We gonna party of course 
 Gonna be some emotional songs 
 We're gonna take it all the back for y'all 
 Then we gonna keep it in the truest essence of hip hop 
 The battle, we gotta keep it in the battle right y'all? 
 Y'all ready for that? 
 Alright

 (Watch out, we run New York) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The takeover, the break's over, homie 
 God MC - me - (Jay-Hova) 
 Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war 
 R.O.C. too strong for y'all 
 It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test 
 Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest 
 You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gonna win? 
 This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch 
 Your reach ain't long enough, dunny 
 Your peeps ain't strong enough, nuh uh 
 Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy 
 Sure we'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady 
 We bring knife to fistfight, kill your Grandma 
 We kill you iddy bitty ants with a sledgehammer 
 Don't let me do it to em, dunny, cause I overdo it 
 So he won't confuse it with "just rap music" 
  
 [Hook] 
 R.O.C., we running this rap shh 
 M Easy, we running this rap shh 
 B. Sigel we running this rap shh 
 Get zipped up in plastic when it happens that's it 
 Freeway, we running this rap shh 
 O & Sparks, we running this rap shh 
 Chris & Neef, we running this rap shh 
 ("Watch out!! We run New York") 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews 
 You little, I got money stacks bigger than you 
 When I was pushing weight, back in '88 
 You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya 
 Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour 
 Well, we don't believe you, you need more people 
 Roc-A-Fella, students of the game, we passed the class cause 
 Nobody can read you dudes like we do 
 Don't let em gas you, like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you" 
 Trust me on this one, I'll detach you 
 Mind from spirit, body from soul 
 They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole 
 Oh no, you're not on my level get your brakes tweaked 
 I sold what your whole album sold in my first week 
 You guys don't want it with Hov 
 Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no! 
  
 [Hook] 
 R.O.C., we running this rap shh

 ("Watch out!! We run New York") 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I know you missing Nas the (fame) 
 But along with celebrity comes about 70 shots to your frame, homie 
 You's a (lame) 
 You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads 
 Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash 
 Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage 
 Fell from "top 10" to "not mentioned at all" 
 To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours 
 Matter of fact you had the worst flow on the whole entire song 
 But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine 
 That's why your (lame) career's come to an end 
 It's only so long fake thugs can pretend 
 Homie, you ain't live it 
 You witnessed it from your folks' pad 
 You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life 
 I showed you your first TEC , on tour with Large Professor 
 Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser 
 So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong 
 You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song 
 And you ain't get a coin, homie, you was getting fucked then 
 I know who I paid, God - Serchlite publishing 
 Use your (brain) 
 You said you've been in this 10, I've been in it 5 - smarten up, Nas 
 4 albums in 10 years, homie?? I could divide 
 That's one every 2, 2 of them things was due 
 1 was "nah," the other was Illmatic 
 That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average 
 And that's so (lame) 
 Homie, switch up your flow 
 Your shit is garbage, what you trying to kick, knowledge? 
 You cats gonna learn to respect the king 
 Don't be the next contestant on that Unplugged screen 
 Because you-know-(who) did you-know-what with you-know-who 
 But let's keep that between me and you ma

 R.O.C., we running this rap shh 
 B. Sigel we running this rap shh 
 M Easy, we running this rap shh 
 Get zipped up in plastic when it happens that's it

 ("Watch out!! We run New York") 
  
 R.O.CIn the past several weeks two separate investigations were launched as a result of the wrongful detention of Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips. My team has been privy to the status of the Barneys third party consultant investigation. In continuing our research, we also contacted the New York State Attorney General’s office for the status of their investigation into both Barneys and Macy’s. Those findings are not yet available. 
  
 While I await the findings of the Attorney General’s Office, I have agreed to move forward with the launch of BNY SCC collection under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling. I am in a unique position to use my voice to affect change to this disturbing issue. The easy position would have been to walk away and leave policy making to others hoping that someone addresses the problem. I will not leave the outcome to others. I will take this into my own hands with full power to recommend, review and revise policies and guidelines moving forward. I am choosing to take this head on. 
  
 As I previously stated, the collaboration with Barneys has always been about giving and The Shawn Carter Foundation. From this collection, the Foundation will receive not only 25% of sales, it will now receive the additional 75% of Barneys’ sales, totalling 100% of all sales from BNY SCC. Along with 100% of sales from the collaboration, the Foundation will receive an additional 10% of all retail sales from Barneys New York stores nationwide and Barneys.com on November 20th.  - Shawn “JAY Z” Carter[Intro] 
 Can I get a small commercial break? 
 I think it's time for a small commercial break 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 Get up and stretch, I'm ready 
  
 [Verse] 
 Lookin' at them S Dots, it's about that time 
 To do Michael Jordan numbers 
 The sneaker game is mine 
 I ain't made 'em for the ball court, I made 'em to shine 
 So you can score big when you courtin' a dime 
 When niggas see me, shit, they see the grind 
 You gotta be blind you only see the shine 
 I dropped them S Dots and in record time 
 The number one seller since they first design 
 50-50, you know how I handle mine 
 A nickel for you, gimme my dime 
 Tell Paul Fireman I got him on fire, man 
 He ain't been this hot since A.I. was signed 
 Now a nigga talkin' to Kenyon Martin 
 Shawn Marion, shit I might be startin' 
 S Dot NBA niggas 
 Went from bein' in VA to signin' NBA niggas 
 I hurdled every hurdle, obtained 
 Every dame that was out of a nigga reach with my figure of speech 
 Open the door for my niggas with me 
 Openin' more for niggas I don't know so all y'all niggas can eat 
 If it wasn't for S Dot...

 Not that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
 Left holes through some guy clothes 
 Stop your nonsense 
 Glock with the full clip 
 Y'all cats better duck when the fool spit 
 One shot could make a nigga do a full flip 
 See a cat laying shocked when the fool hit 
 Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you 
 But see me I wanna love for free like Akinyele 
 Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly 
 If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly 
 All night get you wide up inside the telly 
 Side to side, til you say Jay Z you're too much for me 
  
 [Hook]

 [Verse 2] 
 Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it 
 The same place where the rhymes is invented 
 So all I do is rap and sex imagine how I stroke 
 See how I was flowing on my last cassette 
 Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though 
 Never get hot, never run out of ammo 
 Cats hating and shit cause I Jayed your bitch 
 You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
 And now you're, acting raw but you never had war 
 Don't know how to carry your broad, wanna marry your broad 
 Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty 
 Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy 
 She wanted, us to end cause I touched her friend 
 She gave me one more chance and I touch her again 
 I seen her tears as she busted in 
 I said shit 
 There's a draft 
 Shut the door ma and come on in 
  
 [Hook]

 [Verse 3] 
 Yo 
 Got a vendetta even though I been better 
 Left him in the cold with a thin sweater 
 Rap cats on Prozac get the bozack, cats threw 
 Two at me I threw fo' back, hold that 
 Let the dough stack 
 Way before Big had the gold Ac 
 Dame had the Lex black 
 Cats wanna test that, stress that 
 And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at 
 I suggest that niggas invest in a vest when I come through 
 With the Glock jet black you niggas step back 
 I'm the best at you know I ain't no apprentice to this 
 Me and my niggas we invented the shhh 
 I came into the business with this 
 The Originator, none greater 
 Roots band drop that shhhh[Chorus: Jay-Z] 
 I'm what the game made me 
 Not what the fame made me 
 No amount of money can change me 
 I'm what you lames can't be 
 Live nigga what? Live as fuck 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Check, live from the 7-1-8 
 Either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your wake 
 I'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, Knock My Hustle 
 How can y'all understand the struggle? 
 It's hard to live, when you got greedy niggas in the mix 
 Knowin I outclass three-E niggas in the six 
 So I outblast til it's empty clips 
 And I outlast niggas, survival of the fit 
 One life, I gotta make sure it's done right 
 Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation 
 Ball out, until I fall out 
 Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out 
 Hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain 
 Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain 
 Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin from 'caine 
 But it'll only catch you and track you down 
 With no deal, who you gonna rap to now? 
 Start your own record company, that's profound 
 Live niggas gonna rumble when you backs on the wall 
 Jive niggas gonna crumble and fall 
  
 [Chorus] 
  
 [Verse 2: Memphis Bleek] 
 Aiyyo whether in the Pinto, or rollin in the six 
 I come through cocky, holdin my dick 
 I never switch shit, cause that's some bitch shit 
 I get the Bisquick take it to the district 
 Cause I could never get rich, and switch my style 
 I just cop a little hurt, to the mercantile 
 I'm tryin to get it though, rhymin with this six digit flow 
 Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal 
 Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch 
 Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts 
 Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard 
 Til you got somethin icey, round your neck 
 In this concrete jungle get rich or remain humble 
 Never speak the biz, at worst I might mumble 
 Niggas test it I spit guns, angrily 
 Til all that remains is me 
  
 [Chorus: Memphis Bleek] 
  
 [Verse 3: Sauce Money] 
 I went from no dough to show dough to money to blow 
 From umm, ho I don't know, to get deez 
 Never, "Excuse me miss," bitch please, never try to provoke 
 Same disrespectful cat I was when I was broke 
 Ain't nuttin changed baby but the different faces I stop 
 Or maybe some of the places I shop 
 Now that I run through tracks like cleets with a Air 
 For some of the hottest beats, still catch me eatin at Pete's 
 Fuck the foul cat who screamed out and threatened my life 
 It's all good, here I come kid, dead to the hood 
 Til I'm in the dirt, foul cats like termites 
 Come out of the woodworks, if they think you stack paper 
 Dead niggas react later while the cancer spread 
 Teach a team how to scheme before they answer lead 
 You know me, I used to shoot hoops in the park, ain't nothin changed 
 Except now I push Coupe's in the dark 
  
 [Chorus: Sauce Money][Intro] 
 Jigga, Vol. 2 bitch 
 Yeah 
 Fuck Judge Wapner, it's Jigga 
 Ya heard? 
 Y'all niggas in violation of the "Player Hating Code" 
 Session 1001 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Yo, I gives a fuck if you traum'd up 
 Dom Perrignon'ed up 
 Niggas from where want what? 
 One slip'll get your cherry bombed up 
 I got heavy arm 
 And my niggas Homicide and Deadly Calm in the cut 
 B, test your dumb blonde luck 
 Fuck with the wrong one 
 Shawn gun, harm one, two, fuck y'all wan' do? 
 Bastards, niggas know I blast quick 
 As if y'all had to ask, shit, get your ass twist 
 It's the rap's El Niño, get your brain splitted 
 And I don't like pussy well enough to hang with it 
 You ain't with it, same shitted 
 They can't fuck with the languaddage 
 Soon as the slang's spitted, if you came you get it 
 Plain as a game with them thangs with it 
 On co-sign and the whole nine 
 Leave you where I find yo ass, lost with no sign 
 You're so wrong 
 I'm the last nigga to roll on 
 Got a vest on, went to Folsom 
 When you guess wrong I'ma press one 
 Motherfucker 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a fuck about the D.A 
 When you see Jay, better crawl for your heat 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 Ya heard me? 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a shit about the plaintiff 
 Nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I give a shit if it's small claims like stealing your bitch 
 Or if it's Supreme Court like stealing your bricks 
 Look, my guns is all-range, more pain 
 Indifferent to whether you're big money or small change 
 When I cock it, ball game 
 My pistals never miss-trial, here's the determent 
 With no chance of parole, bullets coming concurrent 
 I'm like "Why, nigga? Try Jigga" You must remember 
 It's like being on trial for your life with a public defender 
 Let the jury fill the seats up, and start the court calendar off 
 With docket number 9mm 
 All rise 
 The Honorable Jay-Z presides 
 Instead of a mallet, I hold a tool 
 All objections over-ruled 
 Save your opening arguments, hope you understanding 
 Two guns, right over left, that's how I cross-examine 
 Like Tom Cruise, pop 'em with the Top Gun, you lose 
 Jigga's no lie, and y'all can't handle the truth 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a fuck about the D.A 
 When you see Jay, better crawl for your heat 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 Ya heard me? 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a shit about the plaintiff 
 Nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 No flow's sicker, no cell can hold Jigga 
 Since I dropped Reasonable Doubt, no coke can convict us 
 No contest in a rhyme fest, I'm best 
 Under oath raise my right hand, and I spit it honest 
 Know your facts for real, 'fore y'all decide to act ill 
 When you blow trial ain't no coming back on the pill 
 It's Murder One, bail set at a, half a mill 
 It's Murder One, for you backwards motherfuckers: red-rum 
 Commit hate crimes, fake rhymes I hold in contempt 
 You get state time for faking like you greater than him 
 So cop a plea, to lessen charges, pay your fine at the Desk Sergeant 
 Say you're sorry, then take your property 
 I be sho' defended, flow splendid, no co-defendant 
 While you niggas hold trial with no motions in it 
 Three time felon, third album, locking it down for the term 
 Of Lifetime, Vol. 2, nigga, court is adjourned 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a fuck about the D.A 
 When you see Jay, better crawl for your heat 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 Ya heard me? 
 Fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street 
 I gives a shit about the plaintiff 
 Nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me 
 It's People's Court, we hold court in the street[Hook] 
 Nickels and dimes, kilos and nines 
 Can't stop the flow when all we know is crime 
  
 [Sample] 
 Talk broken english and drug selling 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I got the formula to success: get yourself 
 A kilo from Bobbito, then get yourself a couple of peoples 
 And we can make this work, never let them niggas try to jerk 
 If they do, put them in the dirt then murk 
 Now, get your property some place to harbor these 
 Get yourself a couple of shorties that shoot a Glock with ease 
 And let's start clocking G's, never let Bobbito sell you flour 
 Take a [?] now it's time to flip 'em like Micky D's 
 Take your baking soda and your triple beam 
 Not too much soda, gotta keep it potent enough to cripple fiends 
 And keep 'em running, coming back; keep your gun in lap 
 In case these niggas try to steal your crack, there'll be none of that 
 Just lock it down like Comstock nothing better 
 Don't ever sell a tray on my block you'll need the doc- 
 -Tor, move fast to have a empty case 
 When you start seeing dough get that fire proof sentry safe 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Hustling 101 welcome to the class 
 You'll learn the art of dealing history and making broken English your math 
 I can't teach you how to stash, see myself I hold cash 
 Every dollar like its my last, 'cause it might be 
 I stay away from hoochies that love Gucci's and Louis 
 Vuitton - the Don, before I spend: do me 
 Before the sun rose we was out chasing dollars 
 With a couple of O's that follow downing bottles of rosé 
 And we celebrating living life 'cause Hell can wait 
 First it was capsules, now its fish scales and selling weight 
 What about rapping, rappers always be asking, "What?" 
 While you was on promo tour I was at home laughing 
 Stashing, staying in fashion, putting cash in 
 The fireproof sentry safe if we die for loot 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Slacking in the game, can't make it happen 
 Cop some cracks and put yourself back on the map and 
 Once your clientele's grooving without you nothing's moving 
 You got that shit they want, need, gotta have when they're using 
 This shit is deeper than the streets, we're working for the government 
 Before they try to Larry Davis me we're going public 
 Can't see my future from the street so I live for now 
 Gotta get legit before they hear my name too much downtown 
 Tryna be up out this shit soon as I start packing 
 Every time I try to leave this game it pull me back in 
 A magnet to selling small white crack mints 
 Think bags of it 'cause I never had shit 
 I gotta get mine regardless even if it means 
 Putting my ass on the line like a trapeze artist 
 I gotta blow, watch for the smoke 
 That's all I know so that's all I wrote 
  
 [Hook]B High: When we were kids, we'd be outside playing basketball. We'd be a man short and he's supposed to be on our team, and we'd be waiting for him, and you'd go get him and he'd still be upstairs writing, and, reading dictionary's, understanding words and putting them together inside his head. In the projects you live in dog years right? I remember once this lady told me "you guys might never live to be 21 years old." So at 14 or 15 years old you're damn near a grown man in your mind. You're doing things, you're hanging out all night, you might be carrying a gun, you might be selling drugs. You might have a car, you might be paying your parents rent and taking care of the household. So those years living the way you are to be 25 is like being 50. You have knowledge far past your youth. So as you get older you just accumulate more things, as you're learning more things. He just learned to play both sides of it. I remember we was driving down Nostrand Avenue one day. Listening to some music. And I was telling Jay "Yo you need to be spitting such and such man, giving them some real knowledge" and he was like "Nope, it'd be too deep. I can't be too deep I have to spoon feed them. Everything I do I have to spoon feed them lightly. If I give them too much they won't take it. Once I spoon feed them lightly, feed them sugar feed them sugar, and then give them some knowledge on top of that, and then they'll take that in and start growing with you, and you know, follow me." So you know, he had the plan. 
  
 [Musical interlude: "Politics As Usual"] 
  
 Tone Hooker: I remember one day we was chilling, and Dame told me yo think of a name for us as a rap crew. In ten minutes I wrote down ten little names. Roc-A-Fella happened to be the first name, and everybody was like "yo that's a dope name." But Dame was like "Why Roc-A-Fella, like what made you think of that?" We rock fella's on stage, you guys are flashy guys, you're about getting money, cause the Rockerfeller's were known as a rich and powerful family, so we just took the name, changed the lettering a little bit, R.O.C., it went from just a game of a group of people to an actual record company. Reasonable Doubt showed a mentality of the bosses versus the runners. The irony is to this day everybody is a boss or trying to appear like Jay first appeared in that album, Reasonable Doubt, versus when in the 90s everyone just wanted to be the best rapper, now everybody wants to be the best hustler. 
  
 [Musical interlude: "Politics As Usual"] 
  
 Kareem "Biggs" Burke: A lot of people just kind of glorified the hustling aspect of it. But if you really listen to Reasonable Doubt, he does glorify it, but at the end he shows the repercussions of it, so I think if they got the whole message, they can understand exactly why he's celebrating. Like this kid who father left him, and the environment around him and around all of us. There was always something, like Dame his mother died, his father left as a kid, and me being evicted when I was 10 years old, and living in a shelter for years. It was always that one thing in our lives that we had in common that we knew we wanted to take over the world and do something that's groundbreaking, and that's that drive that we had as we started to get older and see things and get in the business, and then having the money was always a celebration for us, but it was a celebration because of our circumstances, and I don't think people knew that. And it was always from the smallest to the tallest, like being able to get your first $100 pair of sneakers, being able to get your first bottle of champagne was a celebration. It's just that things kept growing for us, so we were celebrating all the time. 
  
 [Musical interlude: "Politics As Usual"] 
  
 Kareem "Biggs" Burke: You know I am blown away by the talent and Jay lyricism, I'm blown away by what the producers have done. I'm blown away by the artwork, I mean Jonathon Mannion's career started from that right? He did Jay's next 8 albums, he did DMX, he's doing Kendrick now and Eminem, I'm seeing interns become execs right, these kids now who build businesses and want to be part of companies and want 50/50 ventures and want to build and buy and sell. And some of the millennials don't even know where that came from, I mean that came from us, from Reasonable Doubt. I mean it's a great feeling just to be a part of that. To know that we're a part of history. Jay right now have more number 1 albums than Elvis Presley, behind The Beatles, we didn't plan that. It's just a celebration. 
  
 DJ Premier: I knew Jay already just from him with Jaz and we see each other in all the same hot spots, the fly spots where you wanted to get into where hip hop was underground, you had to be somebody to get in, you didn't have to be a platinum artist but you had to be somebody. 
  
 Kyambo "Hip Hop" Joshua: I basically met Jay through my brother Biggs. Kareem Burke when I was in high school. At a party he was performing at, we was on the line, and they basically told him "Hey this is Biggs little brother" and he said "Well come with me" and he basically took all of us off the line and we went into the club, and I've been with him ever since. Drinking Cristal the first time I was in the club. 
  
 Memphis Bleek: I grew up just knowing him as Shawn from the 5th floor. I knew his moms, his sister, his nephews, I used to babysit his nephews, his mom used to pay me a few dollars, so I always known him. I used to get in trouble for hanging with him, cause my mom knew they was the dope boys, you too young to be with the dope boys. 
  
 Kyambo "Hip Hop" Joshua: I believe it was the first day they opened the office up, and then asked if I wanted a job. At one time I had the album and nobody in the world had it. I was about to graduate so I had to, it was rehearsals, and I just remember listening to it, like nobody knows what I'm hearing, nobody knows what's about to happen. I wish I could have took my headphones, flipped them around, and let the world hear it. 
  
 Memphis Bleek: My favourite song on the album had to be "D'Evils." Hands down, I stole a copy of the song I liked it so much. To where Jay and B High came to my apartment, like "Yo I heard you giving out copies of this song, the word came back to you," they was ready to beat me up, drop me from even hanging with them cause they like "you a thief" but they didn't understand I needed that record for my soul, like you are talking to me. 
  
 DJ Premier: When I DJ gigs now, soon as I drop "D'Evils" the crowd goes crazy. And they're singing it, I'm watching them in the crowds mouthing the words, "Friend or Foe" too. "Friend or Foe" for the gigs I do, always makes the crowd go crazy. Soon as they hear it come on, it's on. "Friend or foe yo, state your biz 
 You tint the door, ah, there it is" Even when he says "you tint the door?" I drop the fader and it's silence, and the whole crowd go "and there it is" like in unison. And that's the proper place to drop the fader to see if they're following along cause they're die hard fans of those songs. Yeah "Friend or Foe's" heavy. 
  
 [Musical Interlude "Friend or Foe"] 
  
 Kyambo "Hip Hop" Joshua: He said he was only gonna make one album, so it was really like he put everything in and he had his whole life to make it. And the producers that worked with him were people that knew him for years, so he made like 10 or 20 songs with them before he even made the ones that were on Reasonable Doubt. At least the bulk of them, like Clark Kent and Ski. They both had a lot of songs with Jay so their whole sound had a chance to get refined. And by the time we finished it off with Premier and a couple of other producers there was already a sound 
  
 DJ Premier: Ski was a major part of Reasonable Doubt being that he was already around Jay with Original Flavour so once his section of the album was placed, he to me is the root of it. I was the icing pretty much, so, to close it out. But you heard it once you popped it again and again, we talking CDs and cassettes back then. Cassettes are a huge part of our culture. We come from riding in cars and having a big radio, we used to having a big radio on our shoulder or down here to walk with, or having a ride with a big system. So I gear everything towards that, so that's my mentality even now, I love driving, I drive all the time, just to bang out and listen to dope music. Reasonable Doubt is one of those that will carry you to your destination and back. 
  
 Memphis Bleek: Look where it took us. That album took us on tour with U2. It took us to Africa to do Water for Life. Bring clean water to villages that didn't have. That album got us able to do a 9/11 charity show to give back to families, after Columbine, the spectrum is enormous. It took him to the White House, you can stop there. 
  
 Jonathan Mannion: So the first time I went to Roc-A-Fella offices, kind of ripped through the book, and you know Jay was like this is dope, you know I went in to see Dame and he was like "flip flip through the book" like two or three pages and he was like "alright cool, how much are you charging?" And I was like "oh man like I dunno, cover my expenses, let me do what I want to do, and execute my creative perfectly, and I'll do it for $300 less than the next lowest bid." And he looked at me crazy. What does that even mean? 300 less than the? What are you even talking about? It wasn't really about the money, that's what I told him, I just want to do it, I need this chance to set the pace, the ideas I have are crazy. That's when the album was originally called Heir to the Throne, and from there it switched to Reasonable Doubt the following day. I think ultimately it ended on being classic portraits, it really established him as this Brooklyn, already established OG. It's clean its sharp its styling. We wanted to create something that was lasting, that we could have taken on that day in 1996 or yesterday in 2016. When the title switched and it became Reasonable Doubt, it was like OK, he knew who he was and was really confident in the album, he's always been one to allow people to discover for themselves, cause he felt like when you discover it for yourself it becomes part of you and then you represent i harder because you decided to love it. "Dead Presidents" was the first I ever heard, and as soon as I heard it, with the two different versions, I was like he's out of here,  I fought so much harder to get the album because of that, even though I hadn't heard the rest of the album, which ends up being such an incredible complete thought. 
  
 Ski: I was at this music conference, and Nas had just dropped Illmatic, and everybody was out there playing Nas' album on the strip, and every car was going past playing "Whose world is this" and I was like "Yo this song is crazy!" So I just kept listening to the record and I was like damn when I get home I want to find something similar to that, that vibe, so I started digging, dropped the needle, found the [?] sample, chopped it up, I put Nas vocals in there to hear if he would fit. I was like yeah that's that vibe. Then I played it for Jay, and when Nas' vocals came I said "Don't worry about that, Imma take that out." He was like "Nah keep that, that shit is dope" and that's how it came out, and you know, he killed it. 
  
 [Musical Interlude: "Dead Presidents II"] 
  
 Ski: Yeah mean, we definitely got paid for the work we did, they took care of us. I remember getting on the train with the backpack, with 20 grand in the back pack on the train, if people would have known I'd have been done. 
  
 Emory Jones: You know, the statute of limitations, but you know, it was one of those things. We was hustlers. You know. You gotta figure like this: Wouldn't you rather get paid cash money than get jerked about somebody telling you we need to do this deal with you, and we need to check these royalties and never see them? Soon as you got this cash money you go play them bills quick. 
  
 [Musical Interlude: "Can I Live"] 
  
 Emory Jones: "Can I Live" means so much because, as I said it goes back to us in Vegas and real, you know ringside at the Tyson fight, and we see B.I.G. and Puff, and Dr. Dre sitting in front of us, and it was like y';all really here ring side. The lyrics alone were like, that's where my nickname Vegas Jones come from. "We at the crap table the one that starts a G up." "This way no Fraud Willies present gambling they re-up." That was me. I stand at the Craps table, two chicks with me, one with a bottle of Dom, one with a bottle of Cristal, I'm up 20 thousand, that's a free trip. That was a moment in time we was just on our mojo, in the streets, living life and just doing what we do. 
  
 [Musical Interlude: "Can I Live"] 
  
 Jonathan Mannion: From start to finish, you may not like everything, but it's like a complete thought ,delivered, executed perfectly without the pressure of anybody telling you what to do. It's just what felt right for him, and all the people he surrounded himself with. 
  
 Ski: The music is just honest. It was from your heart. Anytime when you speaking the truth when you being honest about whatever you do people gonna feel it. That's all it was. Honest lyrics, honest creativity always resonates. No labels, nobody telling us how to do it. This creative freedom, just being your own person, your own boss, in whatever you do. And just not being afraid to do your thing, to express whatever you need to express however you're gonna express it. 
  
 Emory Jones: That album has a spot in my heart forever. It's the sound of the heart, when you got the family you got the kids, you got mom, you got God but I have Reasonable Doubt. I thin kit represents that culture of what we are, who we are, the world is set up to give the Good, the Bad, the Ugly, some of you might like it, some won't, but that was a language that we know a lot of people spoke. 
  
 Ski: It's relatable you know? There's still people out there hustling they want to get theirs. They're on their entrepreneur shit, they need that motivation, they need their "Politics as Usual," they need those songs, that get you up and make you want to do stuff, and give you inspiration to keep on pushing for what you pushing for, and this a good album for that, it just embodies that energy. 
  
 Tyran "Ty Ty" Smith: Jay and I grew up together in Marcy Projects. I lived in 552, he lived in 530 something. Like across the park from me. I used to set up battles, I used to talk so much shit to other rappers around the neighbourhood, Jay would be out of town and I would just have battles set up on the other side of the project, and Jay come back I don't even know he back and someone say "yo be back" and I'd be like "oh yeah," and I just call him out the window, and Jay would come down and he would go battle these guys. And he never once even asked me who we going to battle, or I'm busy I got shit to do, he knew I was talking so much shit he had to back me up. I don't think there was one person that didn't think that Jay was the best rapper in the world, out of our whole crew. Whatever I had to do, it was never a problem, you just gotta be humble and do it. If you believe in someone it's not even a thing, you just do it. I remember passing out CDs to people you know in Atlanta in the mall passing out Jay's CDs I was down for all of that cause I wanted it to work. 
  
 Gee Roberson: Oh man 17 John St was the hub of it all. Like it was this small office, that was in the Wall Street area, a staff of about 8 of us, and you know it's amazing cause just think about this, you have a staff of 8 doing the job of 200, making it happen, everybody was just a family, huddled up, rolling out full steam to make it happen, on one accord, pushing one goal, just to drive the album, push the album. I was the intern,m straight out of college, so I'm starting at the bottom grinding, making it happen, just playing my part, my role.  So I was calling every college radio station, every college rep, that was one hat I wore. And then that hat morphed, remember with a staff of 8 you do more than one thing. I was wearing the radio hat  for the day, and then when I left the office to do the field work, as far as I would do retail promotion, so at the time I would go to all of the local mom and pop record stores and make sure the posters was on the windows, make sure we were getting prime placements. at the time we were going up against everybody, it wasn't a situation of the Jay Z of today, it was like "Who's he? Who's that?" It was more so turning the "who is that" to "I'm the one." In all reality as the record was growing, Jay was on the road, he had to win people over, and he would do whatever it takes to win that crowd over. From spitting acapella, to throwing a stack in the crowd, whatever it took to win that crowd to walk out of there, oh "who was that guy? This Jay-Z guy is real, this Jay-Z guy is crazy, oh my goodness I just left this Jay-Z show" like he had the presence of mind from day one to always know I don't care how many people in here know me, I don't care how many people in here don;'t know me, I know one thing, I'm gonna walk off this stage with everybody knowing me. That drive and that focus when it came to his show from day one, that was something instilled in him, that was just part of his DNA. 
  
 [Musical interlude: "22 Two's"] 
  
 Tyran "Ty Ty" Smith: Rapping to Jay was probably the easiest thing, he probably didn't realise, I don't know he never said, but if you can do something so easy, you can look at it like it's amazing cause it comes natural to you. Everyone else is looking at you like "this is sick." Jay's a smart guy, so he's looking like "I can do something with this" you know? 
  
 DJ Clark Kent: I knew Jay and Jaz since we were all teenagers, through a guy named Fresh Jordan. And I always thought they were the best MC's I ever heard, so I wanted to sign them no matter how it was supposed to happen. It just never happened for Jaz, so Jay hit the streets running, it worked out for him, it was never a "yeah I'll go back to that," he was unfind-able. When you making that paper, the only people you gonna let find you is the connect maybe. He didn't just have the best rhymes he had the other part that makes the rhymes believable. Try to imagine knowing that for 8 years in advance, then trying to find somebody, and then trying to convince him "let's do this records," and him going "eh, that's what you do this for? I had that already." It's crazy when you know this guy's talent it out of this world. When I finally got in contact with him, it was make records, but let this guy manage you, because of how relentless Damon was. He was dead serious about these artists whether they were good or not, so it was really to me a good idea to introduce him, so that Jay wouldn't have to think business. All he had to think about is making the best records. I would say it's the most right thing I've done in the music business, because I wasn't gonna let any of these A&R's tell me he wasn't the one. And I just didn't quit. 
  
 Peter Panic: I'd already put out house records and reggae records,  independently, and as like the only college dude in the whole crew I was already researching where to press records, who is the cheapest as far as printing, where to go get your mastering, I started helping Damon with that part way before. It was him trying to shop the material to majors after a while it became obvious that nobody was biting. There was one meeting between Damon and Clark Kent at 1am at Clark's house, and Damon was explaining the frustration with regards to getting the industry to realise Jay is a dope MC. They decided they wanted to put it out independently, and Clark explained to Damon that putting a record out independently is totally different than putting it out with the support of a label, financially as well as administratively. 
  
 DJ Clark Kent: It's partly Maria Davis' album too, she let us perform every week. It was Ty Ty's album cause he held him down, it was B High's album cause he was his cousin that wouldn't let nothing happen to him. It was the Lexus dealers album too cause he was the one who was like yeah we'll let you get the car. It was everyone's album cause it all made what you hear, what you hear. 
  
 Peter Panic: Everybody's hopes and dreams and aspirations are pumped into those records, and I think when the listener listens to that, they can feel that, that earnest that you have when you're working on your first album, it;'s a lot of a hope, mixed with a lot of doubt, mixed with a lot of determination. Nobody else kind of put that  into their music as far as like educational value, let me tell you how to move in these streets. He captured it perfectly, it's going to touch recurring generations.

If you're fucking tired of you favorite rapper lying to you, allow me to introduce you to Tru Life. For instance: If a nigga told you Hov got hit in the head with a bottle either somebody lied to him or he's lying to y'all. If y'all done living like that allow me to introduce y'all to Tru Life. If a nigga tell you a hundred thousand the first week is a success, and in the very same breath act like seven hundred thousand in seven days is a brick...if y'all are tired of living like that shit allow me to introduce y'all it's Tru Life. You already know it is it's the black prez. 2 double O 7. The Black James bond. Jigga man ya heard oh we just started. R-O-C Roc La Tru Life. O.G.

 What's the basic motivation for a hustler? I hit the streets for the same reason a lot of other kids do: I wanted money and excitement and liked the idea of cutting myself loose from the rules and low ceilings of the straight world. The truth is that most kids on the corner aren't making big money--especially if you break their income down into hourly wage.* But they're getting rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The kid on the streets is getting a shot at a dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustling thing pay off in a big way. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yep, that'll be me. He ignores the other stories going around, about dudes who get shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they're working that corner for more than whatever small cut they get of the crack they sell--they're working because they're due for a miracle. The kid in McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There's no dream in fast food. Manager? That's a promotion not a dream. It took me a long time to realize how much courage it took to work at McDonald's, to walk through the streets past rows of hustlers wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never even considered it a possibility. 
  
 When you've got a nation of hustlers working for a small amount of slots, you learn something that you'll never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second-best as a hustler. It's not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the top slot, for the number one position... Sort of like the music business. *[The gang leader’s] hourly wage was $66…the foot soldiers earned just $3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works pretty much like the standard capitalist enterprise: you have to be near the top of the pyramid to make a big wage…so if crack dealing is the most dangerous job in America, and if the salary is only $3.30 an hour, why on earth would anyone take the job?”

 Gentrify your own hood before these people do it 
 Claim eminent domain and have your people move in 
 That’s a small glimpse into what Nipsey was doing 
 For anybody still confused as to what he was doing 
 The neighborhood designed to keep us trapped 
 They red line us, so property declines if you live by blacks 
 They depress the asset and take the property back 
 It's a ruthless but a genius plan, in fact 
 So now we fighting over scraps 
 Crabs in the barrel but, crabs don't belong in the barrel 
 But they ain't never tell us that 
 So in the barrel we gon' like we act 
 We can easily get out the barrel if we stand on each other's back 
 Whoever gets on top as long as they stay attached 
 They can pull everybody out - I was doing just that 
 I told Neighborhood Nipsey stay close 
 There's a 100 million dollars on your schedule, lay low 
 Tell your team to be on point in the places that they go 
 I never dreamed he'd get killed in the place that he called home 
 How we gon' get in power if we kill the source? 
 Y'all like to run off on the plug, so of course 
 That ain't lit, that's a means to an end 
 Me and my team was playing the plug ahead of plan 
 Sometimes we was only making a $1000 a joint 
 That ain't no money but, that ain't they point 
 So those 92 bricks was only 92 thou' 
 So y'all can close your mouth, it ain't nothing for y'all to WOW! 
 But it is something to study 
 We was chasing our goals, not chasing money 
 Niggas chasing hoes, we find that funny 
 I pull up in the Rolls, that hoe gon' want me 
 But I don't want no hoe, I want a wife 
 Somebody to bounce these ideas off at night 
 I be going to sleep hoping Nip visit me 
 That young king had a lot of jewels to split with me 
 And we ain't gotta leave the hood physically 
 But we gotta leave that shit mentally[Intro: Tone (Doug E. Fresh)] 
 Yo, this Tone the referee, knawhatimean? 
 And I'm about to bring y'all some history 
 We got the best of both worlds 
 And I got the Get Fresh Crew 
 Doug Fresh! (one, two, three, come on!) 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Mirror mirror on the wall 
 Whose is the freshest of them all? 
 I love 'em all, but none of y'all 
 Is Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly 
 With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all 
 We got hits like a thirty shot clip 
 When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor 
 Holla at your boy, boys 
 When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys 
 I ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's 
 We give you nightmares, when the year change, we change 
 Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank 
 We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain 
 We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing 
 That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings 
  
 [Hook: R. Kelly] 
 Meeting Michelle at the hotel 
 While Jay and Tone on the way to the afterparty 
 Got the ladies sayin', oh 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Best of both worlds, and we rock the club 
 Youknowhatimsayin 
 Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing 
 Losers lose, so when we does what we do, we win 
 And win again, like deja vu 
 Then we win again, like M.J. do 
 Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue 
 Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move 
  
 [Hook 2x: R. Kelly] 
 In this arena, arena 
 All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up 
 This is for them hustlin' boys and girls 
 It's the return of best of both worlds 
  
 [Slick Rick] 
 Well once upon a time, they left the glove and the star, kid 
 He swore he was the man, but he was nothing but garbage 
 Let me rephrase that, bubblin' with pride 
 Did have skills, but he was ugly inside 
 Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense 
 Hurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience 
 Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash 
 Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class 
 Even let a gay jew man tack his jheri 
 Then, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy 
 Swindlin', forgot the god above him 
 Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing 
 No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break 
 Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake 
 The moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers 
 Be good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as 
 Rick is 
  
 [Hook 2x] 
  
 [R. Kelly w/ Doug E. Fresh beatboxing] 
 My baby momma's robe, my rent is overdue 
 It took half the pay, and now my life is filled with rainy days 
 But I stashed some dough, how much, you'll ever know 
 It's Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, Kells and Jay-Z[Intro: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 What's up baby girl! (oooh!) 
 Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (hey, ey, ey, ey) 
 Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you 
 Rashad is missing you, your mom is missing you (n-n-n-n-no no no) 
 Your pop is missing you, Dame is missing you 
 Damn we missing you... WOO!!! 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 All we listen to is all the different yous 
 4 Page Letters, in addition to 
 Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party popping 
 We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot 
 We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the ROC 
 We used to make up special names for the food we ate 
 Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates (I miss you) 
 Well Dame told me tell you he's doin well 
 Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue 
 But I ain't got to tell you, you lookin over us 
 Our little angel, but you know what 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you 
 New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
 Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you 
 Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you 
 Damn we missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview 
 Now he's dissing me 'cause he dissed you 
 Can you believe the nerve of this dude? 
 'Cause of your memory I won't bring to the pistols 
 (Wondering if your the same and who's been with you) 
 But he got issues enough of that lame 
 I never seen pain like your parents pain 
 But I know God protecting you 
 You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you (I miss you) 
 All the estrogen, the darker texture you are 
 The more intellectual you are 
 So professional, our little purple star 
 Too good for earth you are (I, miss, you) 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you 
 D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
 Kidada's missing you, Shock is missing you 
 Carline is missing you, Tiny is missing you 
 (It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 By the way, B.I.G., we missing you, Pac, we missing you 
 We feel your presence just not in the physical 
 All across the world, blocks is miserable 
 Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous 
 But they not original and they not identical 
 They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews 
 I swear in hip hop, if it's not ten of you 
 Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws 
 Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same 
 Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same 
 But I'm doing what I can, man 
 Tryin to follow y'all down memory lane, man 
 B.I.G., you'd be ashamed to see New York gangbang 
 Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain 
 But I guess that's the issue 
 And it proves how much niggas really miss you 
  
 [Interlude: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)] 
 Pun, we missing you, Big L, we missing you 
 Left Eye, we missing you, Jay, we missing you 
 Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on 
 The world is missing you, the hood is missing you 
 (Wondering if your the same and who's been with you) 
 Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you) 
 This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers 
 Soldiers and soldierettes, all across the world (I miss you) 
 We gon' hold y'all down, y'all living in our memories forever 
 We never gon' let y'all go 
  
 [Outro: Aaliyah (Jay-Z)] 
 I, can't, think, no, more (we not remembering y'all death though!) 
 Since you went away (we celebrating your life, nah mean!) 
 I don't really feel like talking, don't wanna hear you love me 
 Baby (yes!) do you understand me (yes, yes, yes!) 
 I can't do a thing without you (damn we missing you) 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss youCan't Knock The Hustle 
  
 [Intro (Mary J. Blige)] 
 Ok 
 Alright 
 Hey 
 This song right there 
 Was off the first album I ever made 
 It's called Reasonable Doubt 
 Also was fortunate enough to be blessed by the presence of 
 The Queen of, just the Queen man 
 I wanna say R&B, I wanna say hip hop 
 Her name is Ms Mary J. Blige 
 Mary! 
 Let me get all the way up beside you girl 
 You ready? 
 (What I'm ready) 
 I'm making short term goals when the weather folds 
 I just had to test y'all 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I'm making short term goals when the weather folds 
 Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold 
 Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie 
 High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly 
 Shopping sprees, cop in three 
 Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes 
 Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha 
 50 Gs to the crap shooter 
 Y'all can't fade me, chrome stocks beaming 
 Through my peripheral I see you scheming 
 Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming 
 Player's is fiending, what's the meaning 
 I'm leaning on any player intervening with the sound of my money machining 
 My cup runneth over with hundreds 
 I'm one of the best player's that done it 
 Six digits and running, y'all dudes don't want it 
 I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco 
 Mary! 
  
 [Hook 1: Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)] 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 (Cause you can't knock the hustle) 
 Who do you think you are 
 (Jay Z baby) 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay Z] 
 Last seen out of state where I drop my sling 
 I'm deep in the South kicking up top game 
 Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes 
 Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang 
 Your worst fear confirmed 
 Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm 
 Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn 
 While I play with fire, you burn 
 We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire 
 We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm 
 Until legs spread like germs 
 I got extensive with expensive clothes 
 And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows 
 What y'all don't know 
 Uh Uh Uh Uh 
 Cause you can't knock the hustle 
  
 [Hook 2: Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)] 
 But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy? 
 (Talk to em Mary) 
 Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 (They feel you, they feel you) 
 I'm just trying to live right 
 (Why wouldn't you) 
 I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Z (Mary J Blige)] 
 Yo, lunching, punching the clock 
 My function is to make much and lay back munching 
 Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew 
 Nothing to stop, un-stoppable 
 Scheme on the ice, I got to hot your crew 
 I got to, let you dudes know the time like Movado 
 My motto, stack rocks like Colorado 
 Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle 
 It's a damn shame what you're not though (me) 
 Slick like a gato, ya boy Jay-Z 
 My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me 
 Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what 
 (Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what) 
 Straight bananas; can a nigga see me 
 Got the US Open, advantage Jigga 
 Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus 
 Le Tigre, Pa you're too eager 
 You ain't having it 
 Oh good me either 
 Let's get together and make this whole world believe us huh 
 At my arraignment screaming 
 All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even 
 Thieving, as long as I'm breathing 
 Can't knock the way a player eating 
 Alright 
  
 [Hook 1: Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)] 
 I'm taking out this time 
 (Let me buy you one) 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 Who do you think you are 
 (That's right, Jay Z baby) 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
 (Let's take em uptown, let's take em uptown) 
 But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy? 
 (Let's go all the way uptown) 
 Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 (We in Harlem now, let's go to the Bronx on em) 
 I'm just trying to get mine I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real 
 (Let's go all the way up town, let's take em to Yonkers)

 Peanut-butter interior, black body 
 And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista 
 Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up 
 I hear some niggas lookin at me for the come up 
 Try to creep creep, I pull a gun up 
 I put a hole in the first nigga that run up 
 The ballers be Jay, R, and T 
 Spit it cold cause the music is a part of me 
 Can't nobody spit it fast as me 
 Got an academy of haters comin after me 
 I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need 
 Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money 
  
 Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley 
 Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me 
 Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50 
 Gettin that money my nigga 
 Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts 
 Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front 
 Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk 
 Gettin that money my nigga 
 Makin dough off a style I be the best in 
 Glad to be down with these two livin legends 
 Now let me see which league I'mma invest in 
 Gettin that money my nigga 
 Rollin this cheer, put the niggas in fear 
 Makin bitches shed tears, take a look at my career 
 Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe 
 Peep the wing when I hop out the tail - tell 'em Kel

 Pull up to the club, chicks in the back 
 Some smokin on weed, some sippin Co-gnac 
 Into the club, whole crew to the back 
 Super the stars make it sharp as a tack 
 Gotta have my forty-five inch in it 
 In the house, from the gate, twenty minutes 
 Game over and I'm still not finished 
 I play haters like V play tennis 
 Livin like a motherfuckin Richie Rich nigga 
 Got a butler for my Maybach nigga 
 White linen, smokin ci-gar 
 Lyrics like bullets, tongue like a trigger 
 Feelin on your booty 
 Tryin to get one of these nice ladies 
 To come up to my room and do, me 
 Have her man like who's, he 
 Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse 
 And I'mma be a pimp 'til I'm stretches in a hearse 
 Sometimes showbiz is the worst 
 I'm blessed with "The Gift & The Curse," whoa 
 Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa 
 Fresh and clean, now I'm off in the car 
 Got a date with a superstar 
 We take lunch, now twelve o'clock

 To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain 
 Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes 
 It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district where niggas 
 Either in prison or pay visits like in-laws 
 So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw 
 We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar? 
 Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive 
 Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga

 [Ad libs to fade]Part 3: POLITICS As USUAL 
  Poor people in general have a twisted relationship with the government. We're aware of the government from the time we're born. We live in government-funded housing and work government jobs. We have family and friends spending time in the ultimate public housing, prison. We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cards — Medicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food. We know what AFDC and WIC stand for and we stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese. The first and fifteenth of each month are times of peak economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of civics class, but because they actually visit our houses and sit up on our couches asking questions. From the time we're small children we go to crumbling public schools that tell us all we need to know about what the government thinks of us. 
  
 Then there are the cops. 
  
 In places like Marcy there are people who know the ins and outs of government bureaucracies, police procedures, and sentencing guidelines, who spend half of their lives in dirty waiting rooms on plastic chairs waiting for someone to call their name. But for all of this involvement, the government might as well be the weather because a lot of us don’t think we have anything to do with it--we don't believe we have any control over this thing that controls us. A lot of our heroes, almost by default, were people who tried to dismantle or overthrow the government--Malcolm X or the Black Panthers--or people who tried to make it completely irrelevant, like Marcus Garvey, who wanted black people to sail back to Africa. The government was everywhere we looked, and we hated it. 
  
 Housing projects are a great metaphor for the government's relationship to poor folks: these huge islands built mostly in the middle of nowhere, designed to warehouse lives. People are still people, though, so we turned the projects into real communities, poor or not. We played in fire hydrants and had cookouts and partied, music bouncing off concrete walls. But even when we could shake off the full weight of those imposing buildings and try to just live, the truth of our lives and struggle was still invisible to the larger country. The rest of the country was freed of any obligation to claim us. Which was fine, because we weren't really claiming them, either.Uh, uhh, uh 
 Uh, ah, now Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building 
 Uh, uhh, uh 
 Kels in the building, Kels in the building

 I'm in the building tonight, it's goin down my nigga

 The nerve with you herbs 
 Y'all know it's work from the curb 
 With the Lex - the best - observe: 
 Fuck what you heard: splashing, splurging 
 Dashing, that's my word, you know? 
 Champagne glasses crashing, can't ration 
 Used to having a whole lot, so dough, I blow a lot 
 Had a buck fifty while you was still 
 Taking Skippy to school 
 Ran with one of them niggas that heists Tiffany's 
 For them jewels. Back when Duke was jumping 
 Out of Cap'n Crunch food, I was scheming the plot 
 Mostly dreaming a lot but look what it got me 
 4 cars and 400,000 shocks later, fucked up in gators 
 You scared to look, niggas is shook 
 Fuck it, you're vibrators 
 Bullets rank off the hook when niggas try to violate us 
 FBI spies hate us, all they gotta check is my 
 Latest cut then follow my moves: I'm the greatest 
 Fuck how haters been paying dues 
 I cheated, committed felonies when needed 
 While you niggas starve, fuck what you're making 
 If you was hustling like you said 
 We would've bumped paths, so I know you niggas is faking 
 Word up - '95 and forever yo[Verse 1: Jay Z] 
 Uh, yeah 
 You mess around with known assassins, known for blastin' Known for carrying plastic pistols, chrome-attached 
 And known for grossing the most 
 Known for ballin' the hardest, holdin' our own in our post 
 Known for soakin' ya folks, sendin' hoes to ya coast 
 I'm down for whatever

 Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov 
 Cause I rhyme like I be rhymin' in the Rov' 
 Climbin' in them hoes 
 My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows 
 I don't shine, I glow 
 I remind you of that dough 
 Don't I? Kill niggas won't I? 
 My per-sona, hustler turned rapper, smell a crack aroma 
 Send shots like toma! in any language 
 Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth 
 Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs 
 And get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements 
 And for what? ya'll actin' like ya'll better than Hov 
 Ya'll cats should open up on the Letterman show 
 Cats is funny 
 All I do is get money and ya'll shit sound funny to me 
 Everybody's talkin' like they better than Hov 
 But that shit's real funny to me 
  
 [Bridge : Jay Z] 
 Jigga man, ya heard 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay Z] 
 Yo, yo 
 D.A. act like he had a starvin' for Jay 
 If they lock me in a cage, yo party away 
 I'm still hot, I'm still S.Dot ya'll 
 Still got millions buried in the sock drawer 
 Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga 
 What can't kill me can only make me stronger, nigga 
 And when I get back home 
 Get your ass up out the throne 
 Everything's back to the way shit was 
 I'mma stay hot no matter what my shit does 
 I could drop a straight dud, I'mma stay up 
 Niggas tryin' to break my will 
 You know that ain't my steel 
 I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed 
 You're dealin' with a higher power 
 Do 'em like Dwight Eisenhower 
 My life can move a thousand miles an hour 
 Reflect me folks 
 As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke 
 It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series 
 All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury 
 All this bullshit can make the mind weary 
 But my theory is the sun shines clearly 
 The sun shall shine clearly 
  
 [Verse 4: Jay Z] 
 You know what I do? 
 Flow sicker on every record, watch shine 
 Glock nine nigga, heavy necklace 
 Watch mine, about to make niggas very jealous 
 Ice in every letter 
 Untouchable, can't fuck the dude 
 Duck spit, arm shake who Juan Don play 
 With this CEO of the coke on Broadway 
 Never heard so many joints from one man 
 I make chickens bounce, I make the gun jam 
 Flow's like sniffin' a hundred grams 
 Of cocaine raw, rip ya whole brain off 
 Make it real easy to rip ya chain off 
 BK style, see Jay howl 
 We don't play fair, we play foul 
 Go ahead stand there we spray crowds 
  
 [Bridge: Jay Z] 
 Jigga, huh 
 Jigga, what 
 Jigga, what 
 Jigga-Jigga, huh 
 Jigga, what 
 Jigga, what 
 Jigga-Jigga, huh 
 Jigga, huh 
 Jigga, what 
 Jigga-Jigga, huh 
 Jigga, what 
  
 [Verse 5: Jay Z] 
 I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers 
 Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers 
 Got money for 6's and Hummers, chickens among us 
 We just tryin' not to let this bullshit become us 
  
 Flow like none other, I'm the meanest, toughest, done dotta to gun-butcherEPILOGUE 
  
 Oprah and I have since gone on to become friendly acquaintances, after having only observed each other warily from a distance. But it was a fascinating moment to me. Rap, as I said at the beginning of the book, is at heart an art form that gave voice to a specific experience, but, like every art, is ultimately about the most common human experiences: joy, pain, fear, desire, uncertainty, hope, anger, love--love of crew, love of family, even romantic love (put on "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" some time and tell me rap can't be romantic--or if you want to keep it street, put on Mary J. Blige and Method Man's "I'll be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By"). Of course, in the end, it may not be the art form for you. Oprah, for instance, still can't get past the n-word issue (or the nigga issue, with all apologies to Ms. Winfrey). I can respect her position. To her, it's a matter of acknowledging the deep and painful history of the word. To me, it's just a word, a word whose power is owned by the user and his or her intention. People give words power, so banning a word is futile, really. "Nigga" becomes "porch monkey" becomes "coon" and so on if that's what's in a person's heart. The key is to change the person. And we change people through conversation, not through censorship. That's why I want people to understand what the words we use - and the stories we tell - are really about. 
  
 And that's why I wrote this book. I love writing rhymes. There's probably nothing that gives me as much pleasure. There have been times in my life when I've tried to put it to the side--when I was a kid, so I could focus on hustling in the streets, and when I was an adult, so I could focus on hustling in the boardroom--but the words kept coming. They're still coming and will probably never stop. That's my story. But the story of the larger culture is a story of a million MCs all over the world who are looking out their windows or standing on street corners or riding in their cars through their cities or suburbs or small towns and inside of them the words are coming, too, the words they need to make sense of the world they see around them. The words are witty and blunt, abstract and linear, sober and fucked up. And when we decode that torrent of words — by which I mean really listen to them with our minds and hearts open — we can understand their world better. And ours, too. It's the same world.[Intro]

 She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick 
 She gives me extra pillows and seat back love 
 So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club 
 Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model 
 That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo 
 That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef 
 But I never have a problem with that first class seat

 What can't kill me can only make me stronger nigga 
 And when I get back home get your ass up out the throne 
 It's just goin' back to the way shit was 
 I'ma stay hot no matter what my shit does 
 I could drop a straight dud, I'ma stay up niggas tryin' to break my will 
 You know that ain't my steel I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed 
 You're dealin' with a higher power I'm like Dwight Eisenhower 
 My life can move a thousand miles and hour reflect me folks 
 As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke 
 It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series 
 All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury 
 All this bullshit can make the mind weary but my theory 
 Is the sun shines clearly 
 (The sun will shine clearly) 
 Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov' 'cause I rhyme 
 Like I be rhymin' in the Rov' climbin' in them hoes 
 My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows

 Murder niggas won't I? 
 My persona, hustler turned rapper, smell the crack aroma 
 Send shots like toma in any language 
 Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth 
 Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs 
 And get the camcorder to cam cord their hand movements 
 And for what? Y'all actin' like y'all better than Hov'

 Niggas is funny, all I do is get money 
 And y'all niggas sound funny to me everybody's rappin'

 Look around at all the platinum, proof is proof 
 Listen to how niggas is rappin', thats do to who? 
 But I'ma let niggas live 'cause it's beautiful 
 Live niggas 
 Jigga Man ya heard? Clue DuroFrom Part 4 
 When I first started working on this book, I told my editor that I wanted it to do three important things. The first was to make the case that hip-hop lyrics--not just my lyrics, but those of every great MC--are poetry if you look at them closely enough. The second was I wanted the book to tell a little bit of the story of my generation, to show the context for the choices we made at a violent and chaotic crossroads in recent history. And the third piece was that I wanted the book to show how hip-hop created a way to take a very specific and powerful experience and turn it into a story that everyone in the world could feel and relate to. 
  
 All of those threads came together at a pivotal moment for me, the moment when I fully crossed from one life to another.{"On to the next one, on to the next one" - *repeat in background*} 
  
 (Intro: Swizz Beatz) + (Jay-Z) 
 I got a million ways to get it (uh-huh, geah) 
 ... Choose one (choose one, hey) 
 Ay, bring it back, bring it back (uh-huh) 
 Now double your money and make a stack 
 I'm on to the next one, on to the next one

 (Hold up) Freeze! Ay! 
 Somebody bring me back the money please, hey 
  
 (Jay-Z) 
 Hov' on that new shit, niggas like "How come?" 
 Niggas want my old shit, buy my old album 
 Niggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it movin 
 Niggas make the same shit, me I make +The Blueprint+ 
 Came in the Range, hopped out that Lexus 
 Every year since, I been on that next shit 
 Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes 
 Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records 
 Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner 
 Now I rock a teller suit, lookin like a owner 
 No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown-up 
 No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones 
 I move onward, the only direction 
 Can't be scared to fail, searchin perfection 
 Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexin 
 But don't be mad at him when he's on to the next one 
  
 (Chorus: Swizz Beatz) 
 Freeze! Ay! 
 Somebody bring me back the money please, hey 
 I got a million ways to get it 
 ... Choose one 
 Ay, bring it back, bring it back 
 Now double your money and make a stack

 (Hold up) Freeze! Ay! 
 Somebody bring me back the money please, hey 
  
 (Jay-Z) 
 Fuck a throwback jersey cause we on to the next one 
 And fuck that Auto-Tune cause we *onnnnn* 
 And niggas don't be mad cause it's all about progression 
 Loiterers should be arrested 
 I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist 
 So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit 
 You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit 
 On to the next one, somebody call the waitress 
 Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do 
 I don't get dropped, I drop the label 
 World can't hold me, too much ambition 
 Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen 
 Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops 
 Meanin I'm on vaca', chillin on a big yacht 
 Yeah I got on flip-flops, white Louie boat shoes 
 Y'all should grow the fuck up, c'mere let me coach you 
 Hold up 
  
 (Chorus) 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Uhh, +Big Pimpin'+ in the house now 
 Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down 
 Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off 
 Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off 
 Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off 
 Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard 
 Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill 
 Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill 
 Can't chill but my neck will 
 Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal 
 Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets 
 Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects 
 Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps 
 Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best 
 M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text 
 Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next 
 Hold up 
  
 (Chorus) 
 Edited by Dean Jones[Jay-Z] 
 They don't be knowin' the way I be flowing 
 When I be going, I be running the track like Jesse Owens 
 I disrupt the natural scheme, the way that you do things 
 Wit a swing and have 'em rockin like, Sting 
 You say never, you run, if ever you come 
 It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won 
 Come on and ride the rhythm, I produce like jizm 
 Just like the Gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom 
 For greater understanding, I'm landing, blows, and 
 Knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha! 
 Enticing when slicing through tracks 
 You're screaming, "Jesus Christ is back and God knows he can rap!" 
 Me and Sauce put rhythm on the map, so give him his dap 
 And me, I just take mine, gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, FUCK that! 
 Gimme love, nigga... 
 Sauce Money in the house like... 
  
 [Sauce Money] 
 I don't never plan to fall! Sauce is all-out or nothin, I brawl 
 Drag niggas like RuPaul 
 With the funky drummer drumming, I'm never slumming 
 I summon orgasms so I can show you how I'm coming 
 I bang boots, dispute ranks, and execute ganks 
 To bank loot, while your mind shoot blanks 
 Dig it, fatal since I was prenatal 
 Able to drop heavy since the cradle 
 Cooking biters who nibble on my hooks get 'em deep in the files 
 A Boyz n Da Hood, watch the Fish-burne from furious styles 
 Never was right but I made it through wrong 
 Said we waited too long went back in the lab and created new songs 
 New styles I stock 'em for new chicks to jock 'em 
 Your group when I rock 'em once, spiders watch to clock 'em 
 A cut and above the best street life struttin to show 
 Put 'em to the test cause we ain't got nuthin' but love 
  
 [Jay-Z] (Sauce Money) 
 To all my grimys in Crooklyn - (Nuthin' but love) 
 And all my peoples Uptown - (Nuthin' but love) 
 And all my niggas all around - (Nuthin' but love) 
 To all my peeps in hell - (Nuthin' but love) 
 Bitches who fuck and don't tell - (Nuthin' but love) 
 For all you niggas that's WACK! - (Nuthin' but love) 
 For keeping our shit FAT! - (Nuthin' but love) 
 Sauce Money, Jay-Z (Nuthin' but love) 
 Here we go again 
  
 [Sauce Money] 
 What you about to feel, you can't doubt the real threat 
 Peace to all my niggas without a deal yet 
 And that's comin from the streets cause we ain't got nuthin but love 
 Peace to the brothers who keep us in ghetto blood 
  
 [Jay-Z] 
 Here's a stamp and seal away, we build, fuck the tramp 
 Who got my man knocked, for real, ain't nuthin' but love, champ 
 The Jigga, Sauce Money representin one time 
 Strike three, we out, but never out of your mindBounce, bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha 
 Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 Check, check 
 Yo, I'm making short term goals, when the weather folds 
 Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold 
 Chilly with enough bail money to free a Big Willie 
 High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly 
 Shopping sprees, coping three 
 Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah yes 
 Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha 
 50 G's to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me 
 Chrome socks beaming 
 Through my peripheral I see ya scheming 
 Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming 
 Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning? 
 I'm leaning on any nigga intervening 
 With the sound of my money machine-in 
 My cup runneth, over with hundreds 
 I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin' 
 Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow 
 The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind (cause you can't knock the hustle) 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
 Last seen out of state where I drop my slang 
 I'm deep in the South kicking up top game 
 Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes 
 Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing 
 Your worst fear confirmed 
 Me and my fam' roll tight like The Firm 
 Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn 
 Why play with fire, burn 
 We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire 
 We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm 
 Till legs spread like germs 
 I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes 
 And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows 
 What y'all don't know? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle 
 But until the late thang I'm the one who's crazy 
 Cause that's the way you're makin me feel 
 (Cause you can't knock the hustle) 
 I'm just tryin to get mine, I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real 
 Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock 
 My function is to make much and lay back munching 
 Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew, something to watch 
 Nothing to stop, un-stoppable 
 Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew 
 I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado 
 My motto, stack rocks like Colorado 
 Auto off the champagne, Cristal's by the bottle 
 It's a damn shame what you're not though (who?) Me 
 Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z 
 My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me 
 Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what 
 Straight bananas, can a nigga, see me? 
 Got the US Open, advantage Jigga 
 Serve like Sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus 
 Le Tigre, son you're too eager 
 You ain't having it? Good, me either 
 Let's, get together and make this whole world believe us huh? 
 At my arraignment, screaming 
 All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even 
 Thieving, as long as I'm breathing 
 Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even! 
 I'm taking out this time 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
 But until the late thing I'm the one who's crazy 
 Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real[Tone Hooker: Intro] 
 Uh, Yeah 
 Tone Hooker y'all 
 It's a beautiful thing you know 
  
 [Hook] 
 If you want it 
 We got it 
 If you want it 
 We got it (baby) 
  
 [Tone Hooker: Verse 1] 
 Now we got mystical street visions of making multiple Deniro 
 The mula makes the gods fly but we don't need another hero 
 While gun runners be steady gun toting 
 I'm on a seven day cruise laying, flowing steady rocking the boat 
 And the champaign got me feeling eerie 
 My style got me spilling liquor for niggas locked on the island 
 Baby brother could be the man soon 
 Living lovely, laying up in luxury sailing to Cancun 
 Mehico, You know the math kid we get cabbage 
 Let me go, Let's take a break from all these wild savages streets 
 I burst the flow in places ????, comeback on another day 
 So we can handle these brinks in a better way and 
 That's how it had to be and Ladies are mad at me when 
 Word on the street the men calling me there majesty and 
 It must be true I heard it from the Caribbean's 
 Well I'm in love with the last sexy black Mohican 
 My game is ultra magnetic-al, While I'm steady G'ing 
 Remember me if not the bubbly, the Hennessy and 
 Acknowledge my wisdom then understand my culture street and 
 Redefine this powerful life back from the Europeans 
 So I keep making motions, Plus avoid all my failures 
 Without chocking, I'm smoking on potent paraphenelia 
 Ghetto Celeb's keeping love, love 
 We bomb the world with musical drugs and fly live a dove 
  
 [Hook] 
 If you want it (baby) 
 We got it (baby) 
 If you want it (Make it happen everyday of you're life, baby) 
 We got it (baby) 
 If you want it (baby) 
 We got it (baby) 
 If you want it (Every night) 
 We got it (baby)

 [Jay-Z: 2nd Verse] 
 Roc-A-Fella gang, Suit Up 
 Stay fly from the boot up 
 Like, computer 
 Till you die get you're loot up 
 Do what you like, It's still in me 
 When assets become liability's 
 Back to dealing G's 
 But feeling these 
 To bomb like Lebanese 
 Forever cheese 
 I'm dead stain to blow and lit like gas lane(?) 
 Vast game, Live out my life like a movie 
 Till the last rain, blasting the ooze, till I'm woozy 
 Gordo at $12.99 a CD 
 Jay-Z & Tone Hooker is ??? 
 Blasting in the auto 
 The crystal got me thinking about more though 
 Watch out girl, If I needed 
 I can't be stopped, Won't be defeated 
 I come to take you're shit you gotta leave it 
 If I want it I got the guns for it player run it 
 Ready to die, Roc-A-Fella style for a couple of hundreds 
 Fowl, Nothing less than six digits out my mouth (uh-huh) 
 If i ain't platinum soon then It's back down south (say what) 
 Ill built like whatever y'all I'm back on the set 
 Came to claim what I left because my name still rep 
 Even though, player ain't been seen, been on the low 
 Except on the screen (uh), Tryna blow up my flow 
 It's an all out thing, No time to front 
 We make it happen, yeah we go it locked down 
 Fuck y'all want

 For all y'all laughing dudes 
 Trying to knock this get money music

 Roc-A-Fella Y'all 
 Trying to have it like the havers have it 
 You Know 
 Not wish it like the wishers want it 
  
 [Tone Hooker] 
 Yeah, We talking 'bout 
 Getting this cake and what not 
 But I'll tell you what 
 What ever heads you know, struggling 
 And ain't trying to get money 
 You keep them cats away from me 
 You understand, haI made this song awhile ago, I never got to finish it. 
  
 Punch (TDE) told me I should drop it when Mike Brown died, sadly I told him "this issue will always be relevant." I'm hurt that i knew that his death wouldn't be the last...... 
  
 I'm saddened and disappointed in THIS America - we should be further along. 
  
 WE ARE NOT. 
  
 I trust God and know that everything that happens is for our greatest good, but man....it's tough right now. 
  
 Blessings to all the families that have lost loved ones to police brutality.

 - Frederick Douglass[Jay-Z] 
 Uh, uhh, listen 
 First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up 
 Somebody got a problem with Hov' 
 Whassup y'all niggas all fed up cause I got a little cheddar 
 And my records movin out the sto'? 
 Young fucks spittin at me, young rappers gettin at me 
 My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly 
 "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" - gotta move carefully 
 Cause faggots hate when you gettin money like athletes 
 Yung'uns ice-grillin me, ohh - you not feelin me? 
 Fine; it cost you nothin - pay me no mind 
 Look, I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for frontin 
 Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs 
 Damn though mans I'm just tryin do me 
 If the record's two mill' I'm just tryin move three 
 Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E 
 Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage 
 I don't want much, fuck I drove every car 
 Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers 
 Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all 
 I know you waitin in the wing but I'm doin my thing 
 Where's the love? 
  
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.." 
 I said where's the love? 
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of town.." 
 Yeah.. 
  
 And then the Fugees gon' break up, now everyday I wake up 
 Somebody got somethin to say 
 What's all the fuckin fussin for? Because I'm grubbin more 
 And I pack heat like I'm the oven door? 
 Niggas pray and pray on my downfall 
 But everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball 
 Now I don't wanna have to kill sound bar 
 Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar 
 Look scrapper I got nephews to look after 
 I'm not lookin at you dudes, I'm lookin past ya 
 I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper 
 Can I live? I told you in ninety-six 
 That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz 
 I scramble like Randall with his 
 Cunning-ham but the only thing runnin is numbers fam 
 Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love? 
  
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.." 
 Niggas, where's the love? 
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of town.." 
 Holla at me!! 
 "Ain't no love" (take 'em to church) "in the heart of the city.." 
 Uh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love? 
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of town.." 
 Fuck 
 Then Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up 
 Then I wake up to more bullshit 
 You knew me before records, you never disrespected me 
 Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit 
 Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss 
 Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all 
 Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait 
 Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight? 
 Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place 
 Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie? 
 Nigga respect the game, that should be it 
 What you eat don't make me shit - where's the love? 
  
 Where's the love? 
  
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.." 
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of town.." 
 "Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us! 
 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life! 
 (I love you) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 From standing on the corners boppin' 
 To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen 
 For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard 
 From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene 
 You know me well... 
 From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell 
 But since when y'all know me to fail? Nuh uh 
 Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots 
 And if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not 
 I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not 
 Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot 
 Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh 
 Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh 
 And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy 
 Flow infinitely like the memory of the homie Biggie, baby! 
 You know it's hell when I come through 
 The life and times of Shawn Carter, y'all Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready 
 Sing! 
  
 [Hook: Jaguar Wright (Jay Z)] 
 It's the hard knock life for us 
 It's the hard knock life for us!

 Instead of treated, we get tricked 
 Instead of kisses, we get kicked 
 It's the hard knock life![feat. Gwen Dickey] 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 [Jay-Z] 
 Uh huh-uh-huh, yea 
 Jigga 
 Trackmasters, yea 
 Ride 
 Take it back, let's take it back, uh-huh 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Check, you can catch me on top now (top down), playin a club 
 Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above 
 Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club 
 Surrounded by my own thoughts, playin a cut 
 Reminiscin' on days I ain't have a pot to piss in 
 No watches to glisten, no V's with hot systems 
 Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes 
 Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies 
 On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong 
 Had to get ourselves together and move it along 
 Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas 
 Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 Wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
  
 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Was interrupted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit 
 Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?" 
 Maintainin, it's the same old thang 
 A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed 
 I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving 
 She nodded her head in agreement 
 Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down 
 Knew the +Streets+ was +Watchin+, stay hooded down 
 Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now? 
 She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye" 
 I was too deep for you from day one 
 Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks 
 Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark 
 Wanted to be like the older males, sneak and drink old champ-ale 
 Dangerous games we played on the third rail 
 Fiend for the summer breeze 
 Hopped out the Lee's Dungarees 
 Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports 
 To take us away from here, but I cut too much 
 So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush 
 In the mirror 
 My sinners used to back me up 
 Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me 
 All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll 
 Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga! 
  
 [Chorus: Gwen Dickey] 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever doneI'm a hyphen hater 
 If you are in between my words  I'll see you later 
 Cause I'm a hyphen hater 
 You are silent when I speak but I can see you on paper 
 You are higher than an underscore 
 But no more 
 To me, you're as dead as Latin 
 I can't even hear you, when I am chattin' 
 Z comes after Y, we all know that 
 So why did you have to get involved? Like some big man that 
 Was there something wrong with my grammar? Well now it doesn't matter 
 My name is four letters split by the button which is fatter 
 You are only good for pause, but when I got my flow 
 No one will stop me until I bring the applause 
 My alphabet goes from Jay to Z, you are not a proper letter 
 So that is why, I have decided that a space is much better 
 This should not be a surprise to you, your kind of character was up for being dismissed 
 So now that you are free go catch some vibes with brother asterisk 
 Forward slash, back slash, hash tag, comma, no thank you 
 Only the alphabet will do, I'm keepin' it simple with syllable two 
 After zero is where you belong 
 At the end of all those numbers is where you are strong 
 Sharing with cousin underscore 
 Plus and equals sitting next door 
 All is not lost, you have set a legacy 
 On websites, tickets, records and CD 
 This is not the end 
 You were more than a connector, you were my friend 
 There is a new journey on the horizon 
 Go and enjoy life by saying 'Hi Fun!'[Intro] 
 Oh 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I keep you fresher than the next chick 
 No need for you to ever sweat the next chick 
 With speed, I make the best chick see the exit indeed 
 You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me 
 You get the keys to the Lexus, no driver 
 You got your own 2001 to ride in 
 And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why 
 You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me 
 They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank 
 They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks 
 And papayas, from the village to the telly 
 Time to kill it on your belly no question 
 Have more chicks between my sheets than Essence 
 They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot 
 Meet your death in less than 8 seconds 
 Still pounding in my after life 
 Laughing, my thing is tight 
 Let me hear y'all 
  
 [Hook: Jaguar Wright (Kyle Jones) Crowd ​​] 
 Ain't no nigga like the one I got 
 (No one can fuck you better) 
 Sleeps around but he gives me a lot 
 (Keeps you in diamonds and leathers) 
 Friends will tell me I should leave you alone

 Tell the freaks to find a man of their own 
 Man of their own, man of their ownJay-Z has defended the controversial move of trademarking his daughter Blue Ivy's name. 
  
 The musical couple had their daughter in January 2012 and, speaking in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Jay Z opens up about Blue Ivy's musical preferences, as well as why he chose to trademark her name shortly after the birth. 
  
 The rapper says he trademarked 'Blue Ivy' in order to stop others profiting from his family. "People wanted to make products based on our child’s name and you don’t want anybody trying to benefit off your baby’s name," he says. "It wasn’t for us to do anything; as you see, we haven’t done anything." 
  
 Jay Z also claimed that his daughter Blue Ivy prefers his music to her mother, Beyonce's. "She does like her mother’s music - she watches Beyoncé’s concerts on the computer every night. But my album came out and I don’t know if Blue ever heard any of my music prior to this album - she’s only 18 months old and I don’t play my music around the house. But this album was new, so we played it. And she loves all the songs," he says. 
  
 Continuing, Jay Z adds: "She plays a song and she goes, 'More, Daddy, more. Daddy song.' She’s my biggest fan. If no one bought 'Magna Carta', the fact that she loves it so much, it gives me the greatest joy. And that’s not like a cliché. I’m really serious. Just to see her – 'Daddy song, more, Daddy.' She’s genuine, she’s honest, because she doesn’t know it makes me happy. She just wants to hear it."Check 
 Here I am 
 The man 
 I'm swinging and singing and bringing 
 The light to the mic 
 Again 
 Together forever 
 Endeavour, to always prevail 
 Well 
 Whatever the weather 
 I'm better 
 You seem to pale 
 In comparison 
 Jay-Z's embarrassing 
 Your time after 
 Riggity-rhyme master 
 The liggity-last Jay-Z rhyme 
 So you can say I'm 
 So pro fade line 
 Peace[Interlude: Beyoncé] 
 Just talk whenever I want?

 Make my money, nigga![JAY-Z]

 Cellphones in the air 
  
 [Intro: Beyoncé] 
 Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while 
 Heaven can wait, we're only watching the stars 
 Hoping for the best but expecting the worst 
 Are you gonna drop the bomb or not? 
 Let us die young or let us live forever 
 We don't have the power, but we never say never 
 Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip 
 The music's for the sad man (sing) 
  
 [Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z] 
 Forever young 
 I wanna be forever young (yes) 
 Do you really want to live forever?(ah) 
 Forever and ever (sing) 
 Forever young (young) I wanna be (yes) 
 Forever young young ah 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 Forever, forever young 
  
 [Verse 1: JAY-Z] 
 So we live a life like a video 
 When the sun is always out and you never get old 
 And the champagne's always cold 
 And the music is always good 
 And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood 
 And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car 
 Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there is no tomorrow 
 Just some picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime 
 And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind 
 So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine 
 Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind 
 Leave a mark that can't erase, neither space nor time 
 So when the director yells cut we'll be fine, ah 
 (Sing) 
  
 [Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z] 
 Forever young young I wanna be 
 (Forever young) (yes) 
 Do you really want to live forever? yeah 
 Forever and on top ever 
 Forever young I wanna be 
 (Forever young) yeah, yeah 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 Forever and ever young 
  
 [Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyoncé] 
 Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsche's 
 Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous, hold up 
 Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking more shit 
 I be talking more shit, I'm nauseous, hold up 
 I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit 
 And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit 
 Less than four bars, baby, bring the chorus in 
 Did you get the picture yet I'm painting you a portrait 
  
 [Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z] 
 Forever young 
 I wanna be forever young yeah, yeah 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 And ever and ever 
 Forever young 
 I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 Forever your time, sing! 
 (Forever young I wanna be 
 Forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 Forever and ever) 
 One more time, sing! 
 (Forever young I wanna be 
 Forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever? 
 Forever, forever young)

 Make some noise for Beyoncé one time Brooklyn 
 I'mma leave you with this 
 Don't be good, Brooklyn, be great 
 Be great 
 Thank you for tonight, thank you for tonight 
 I love you[Verse] 
 So I'm the bad guy now I hear, because I don’t go with the flow 
 Don’t ever go with the flow, be the flow 
 And I don’t need no middle man to talk to my niggas 
 I understand if you don’t understand, I figure I’m Jigga 
 That’s where we differ 
 I take what’s mine, you accept what they they give you, I get you 
 I don’t take no checks I take my respect 
 Pharrell even told me go with the safest bet 
 Jimmy Iovine offered a safety net 
 Google dangled around a crazy check 
 I feel like YouTube is the biggest culprit 
 Them niggas pay you a tenth of what you supposed to get 
 You know niggas die for equal pay right? 
 You know when I work I ain't your slave right? 
 You know I ain't shucking and jiving and high fiving 
 You know this ain't back in the days right? 
 But I can't tell, like the way they killed Freddie Gray right 
 Shot down Mike Brown how they did Tray right? 
 Let them continue choking niggas 
 We gonna turn style, I ain't your token nigga 
 You know I came in this game independent right? 
 Tidal, my own label, same difference 
 Oh niggas is skeptical as their own shit 
 You bought 9 iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich 
 Phil Knight worth trillions you still bought those kicks 
 Spotify is 9 billion they ain't say shit 
 Lucy you got some 'splaining to do 
 The only one they hating on look the same as you 
 I know they trying to bamboozle you 
 Spending millions on media trying to confuse you 
 I had to talk to myself, Hov you used to it 
 It's politics as usualA word from Hov 
  
 Last night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a ball!! Through all the excitement and joking around (as well as the technical difficulties) I missed out on the opportunity to say something important.. 
  
 On the show as well were Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson.. I thought that to be the oddest pairing EVER but, soon realized, it’s what I’ve always professed..There is NO such thing as BLACK music or WHITE music only GOOD or BAD music..It’s stupid cool to like things that are not like you, and that goes for outside of music.. If you’re an African American you can have a jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor having some Israeli mixed with his jewish count? (Sure they are paranoid but, so are black people after they’ve smoked weed, haaaaa, and plus the JEW fro and the BLUEprint fro are the SAME thing.) 
  
 I think concerts like this should happen more often. ( Outside of the one or 2 festivals a year or “Zootopia”) I’m putting that into the universe..next up Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!! 
  
 Sorry I don’t “Tweet” (do I?) so this will have to do..

 [Verse : 1] 
  
 Roc-A-Fella (?) 
 (?) (?) 
 Test my weight in the apple 
 Never a question of if 
 When you gonna die like cattle 
 Beef I go at it so rugged, Just swear I love it 
 It is that so, Hard to learn 
 My burner give niggas permenant heart murmurs 
 If that ain't reason for concern 
 My crew is dangerous, A strange miscellaneous 
 Niggas left in trouble.. waters like Greg Louganis 
 Ain't nothing touchin' from, Brooklyn to my touchin' on 
 Whatever a fuck you cats raise your heads at, dead that 
 The last time you seen us 
 Niggas popped up in beamers, Shopped up in (?) 
 Locked hip-hop (up) between us 
 Squeamish rappers stay out of my space like venus (?) 
 (?) (?) 
 Murder is right and not a word of it, To your liking since 
 We make it hate to love it like prince 
 Til the nigga feel straight like Bill Gates 
 Or feel a mil-ie, We gonna spill hate 
 And infiltrate , Die is your fate 
 Realize the great, get your ? 
 Professional rockin' nigga wait 
 Time is everything, everything that glitters ain't gold 
 (?) diamonds and every ring WHAT THE FUCK 
 In the driversy, Niggas used to live in the back 
 (?) style, now a nigga bigger than Shaq 
 (?) skills living fat 
 Chickens that used to act ill 
 Fuck ya, I ain't forgivin that (fuck ya) 
 A nigga bitter so, when a nigga hit you..beleive 
 I am tryna hurt your stomach like ten thousand ? 
 Jiggz baby, what it is? Just as casual 
 If you blast me you better believe I blast for you 
  
 [Break]

 You faggot niggas dont play yours 
 My team will slay yours, (?) yours 
 Can't fuck around, we lay yours 
 With our hands up there, shit, I swear to god 
 Since money is respected, you know, I had to get it 
 Collect it like antiques..let it stack (Brrrrrrrrrrrr) like that 
 I mastered the fast shit, now I move on 
 Cause too many bastards tryna get their groove on 
 And now you see me jiggy, you puzzle 
 He ain't sellin no records.. is he ? 
 That nigga gotta hustle.. shit 
 You get your guns by any means, I get my ones 
 You intervene by any means, I get you done 
 (For real)[Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ay yo I got a resolution 
 This year I'm playing right 
 No 6:15 and shit (but) 
 You can stay the night 
 We can go bowling it ain't like before 
 Can't you, see that I'm growing? 
 I was so immature 
 I was young and having money 
 Having honies come to the crib 
 Digging they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me 
 Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge 
 I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses' 
 No room service, just snacks and shit 
 Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready 
 But chicks I was fiending to smash 
 Let 'em lean on the cash 
 Take 'em on long trips 
 Break 'em with long dick 
 There was no such thing as strong relationships 
 But I'm off that playa shit 
 I need a chick that practice Tai Chi 
 And still can buy weed 
 And can give me some good head 
 I'll make her remind me, ya hear me? 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)]

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 I was the worse 
 I used to switch chicks every day 
 Had niggas mad for real like, "I wish he was gay" 
 'Cause they knew, sooner or later hun was getting with Jay 
 In just a, matter of time she was getting with Jay 
 I'll have your chick in the tropics, somewhere sipping on 'zae 
 Spitting up in the Pacific, smoking spliffs in the shade 
 She used to love ya, but she feeling different today 
 You used to smother her, look at your honey slipping away 
 Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space 
 She said, she feel free when she around me 
 I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me 
 She's on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?" 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)]

 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 I was nice to girls but that wasn't the Shawn they felt 
 They said the coupe was alright, but they ain't like the seat belt 
 I look tight, they told me loosen up, run a couple of lights 
 Spank 'em, pull their hair, just don't treat 'em so nice 
 Left me confused, I mess with chicks that was best when abused 
 Nice guys finish last was they special set of rules 
 And me, I overdid it (uh-huh), all chauvinistic 
 Would treat 'em so vicious, would stroke, but won't kiss it 
 But now, I'm trying to flow different 
 I'm trying to cool it now 
 I'm trying to plant a seed, start a new edition 
 I'm sick of chasing chickens 
 Sick of every other city we go, same ol' hoes 
  
 [Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)] 
 (Hey papi)

 (Hey papi)Öldür Jay Z’yi, asla sevmeyecekler seni 
 Asla yeterli olmayacaksın, gerçekleri konuşalım, Jay Z 
 Sikeyim Jay Z’yi 
 Demek istediğim, kendi kardeşini vurdun 
 Jay Z'ye güvenebileceğimizi nereden bilebiliriz ki? 
 Ve daha iyi biliyorsun, zenci, biliyorum ki öyle 
 Ama daha da iyisini yapmalısın oğlum, bunu Blue'ya borçlusun 
 Senin baban yoktu, zırhın vardı 
 Ama bir kızın var, daha nazik olmalısın 
 Öl Jay Z, bu eski günlerdeki gibi değil 
 Bir mazerete ihtiyacın yok, Jay Z 
 Ağla Jay Z, biliyoruz ki acı gerçek 
 Ama ortaya çıkarmadığını asla iyileştiremezsin 
 Naber, Jay Z? Biliyorsun ki gerçeğe borçlusun 
 Jay Z'ye aşık olan tüm gençliğe 
 Sevdiğin insanlar vardı, uyuşturucu sattığın 
 Hayatta yükseklerdeydin, bu bok seni uyuşturdu 
 Etrafta dolaşıyorsun yenilmezmişsin gibi 
 Okulu terk ettin, prensiplerini kaybettin 
 Biliyorum, insanlar seni arkandan vurdu, ben de kötü hissediyorum 
 Ama bu "herkesi sikeyim" tavrı doğal değil 
 Ama sen bir aziz değilsin, bu kumbaye değil 
 Ama senin canın yandı çünkü Ye'den tavır yedin 
 Ona gözünü kırpmadan 20 milyonu verdin 
 O ise sana sahnede 20 dakika verdi, ne sikim düşünüyordu? 
 "Herkesin neyi var amına koyayım?" senin söylediğin 
 Ama eğer herkes çılgınsa, manyak olan da sensin 
 Hayat ne kadar garip 
 Göğsünde düğüm var, düşün bir bıçağın nasıl acıtacağını 
 Un'ı bıçakladın birkaç parçadan dolayı 
 Bahanense "Çok pervasız konuşuyordu!" oldu 
 Egonun sağ omzun üzerinden gitmesine izin ver 
 Solun ise "Kahvaltını bitir!" diyordu 
 Sen Solange’ı suçladın 
 Biliyordun tümü boyunca, yapman gereken tek şey yanlışsın demekti 
 Neredeyse Eric Benet oldun 
 Dünyadaki en fena kızın gitmesine izin verip 
 Söylenmesi gerekenin ne olduğunu bile bilmiyorum 
 Zenci, asla Eric Benet olma! 
 Neyi yapabileceğini bile bilmiyorum 
 Gelecekte diğer zenciler senin oğlunla futbol oynuyor olsa 
 Onu kaybederdin 
 13 şişe Ace of Spade, Boston'a yaptığı gibi 
 Hayır, Jay Z 
 Bay, Jay ZIt's Brooklyn in the house 
 Yeah 
  
 [Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
 Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca 
 Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever 
 I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here 
 I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere 
 I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos 
 Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's 
 Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street 
 Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry 
 Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus 
 Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas 
 Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie 
 Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me 
 Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais 
 Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives 
 Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee 
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely

 In New York yes

 [Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game 
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can 
 You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though 
 But I got a gang of nation walkin' with my clique though 
 Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks 
 Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop 
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back 
 For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add 
 Eight million stories out there in the naked 
 City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it 
 Me? I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made" 
 If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, (I'm payin' Dwyane Wade) 
 Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte 
 Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley 
 Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade 
 Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State...

 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders 
 So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is 
 Lined with casualties who sip the life casually 
 Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve! 
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style 
 And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out 
 The city of sin is a pity on a whim 
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them 
 Mami took a bus trip , now she got her bust out 
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route 
 "Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin 
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends 
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life 
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight 
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion 
 The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien 
  
 [Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z] 
 In New York Yes!<.b>

 Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin 
 On how I fuck the best a shit 
 Specially when Im flippin Baileys 
 Dont give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis 
 I push disease, eatin shrimp diamond rocks larger than life 
 Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was 
 I got you frontin in Armani sweaters 
 Before this rap shit 
 When you was in letters and bullshit berattas 
 And eek classes with mo in the glasses 
 Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's 
 Now all your mens' up in your benz's 
 High post, I swear you be killin me 
 Playin inside my pubic hairs 
 I never worry bout them other chicks 
 Cuz you proved who was your wiz 
 When you was spinnin that bitch 
 I took a little when you was up north 
 Your comisary stay pilin 
 How you livin large on the island 
 All them collects have me vex 
 But when you come home 
 Knew I was comin off wit half of dem checks 
 Now we on the rise 
 Your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes 
 Holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit 
 Folks know I see half the dough 
 Make you wonder a star 
 Pushin hundred thousand dollar cars

 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
  
 (Verse 1: Jay-Z) 
 Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club 
 Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above 
 Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club 
 Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut 
 Reminisin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in 
 No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems 
 Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes 
 Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies 
 On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong 
 Had to get our shit together and move it along 
 Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas 
 Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm 
  
 (Chorus: Gwen Dickey) 
 Wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
  
 (Verse 2: Jay-Z) 
 Was interrupted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit 
 Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?" 
 Maintanin, it's the same old thang 
 A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed 
 I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement 
 Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down 
 While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down 
 Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now? 
 She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye" 
 I was too deep for you from day one 
 That’s why we never had relations, continued in my own zone 
  
 (Chorus: Gwen Dickey) 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done 
  
 (Verse 3: Jay-Z) 
 Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks 
 Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark 
 Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample 
 Dangerous games we played on the third rail 
 Fiend for the summer breeze 
 Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares 
 Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports 
 To take us away from here, but I cut too much 
 So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush 
 My sinners used to back me up 
 Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me 
 All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll 
 Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga! 
  
 (Chorus: Gwen Dickey) 
 I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are 
 I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means 
 And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
 I wish on all the people who really dream 
 And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come 
 And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever doneConcerts are pretty much performance art with the venues changed. And, and just by, by, by nature of the venues the performance change, right? You in a smaller venue it’s a bit more intimate so you get to feel the, you know, the energy of the people 
  
 In a concert, especially a large concert all of that energy comes to you, like, what do you do with that energy? You know so today it’s kind of, it’s kind of, an exchange. You have some way to drop it back off, you know 
  
 When art started becoming part of the galleries. There became a separation between culture. And even in hip hop, people were like, almost like, art is too bourgeois. We’re artists we’re alike, we’re cousins, that’s what really exciting for me: bringing the worlds back together 
  
 I try not to have any expectations going into a performance. I try to just let it happen, just get into the moment and, you know, whatever happens happenA[intro] 
  
 Fuckin cola can 
 Fuckin cola can

 Oh oh oh oh 
  
 [Chorus: Mary J. Blige, Pharell & JAY-Z] 
 I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh) 
 To give you a piece of my mind 
 This what we do 'bout this time of year 
 Who do you think you are? (uh huh, uh huh) 
 Baby one day you'll be a star 
  
 [Verse 1: 2Pac] 
 (Oh, shit) 
 Started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts 
 Lustin' for creamin' - bitches with big butts 
 Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit 
 When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks 
 Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time 
 Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine 
 Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good 
 A local legend through the whole hood, follow me 
 I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby 
 You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy? 
 Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die 
 Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly 
 Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die 
 Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God 
 Understand my ways, livin' major 
 Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Busta Rhymes] 
 Yes you know I'll die for you 
 And ya know I'll ride with you 
 I will always try with you 
 And give ya my love and cry with you 
  
 [Chorus 2: Mariah Carey] 
 I will climb a mountain high aha 
 Until I was up to touch the sky 
 So baby come and get more close to me 
 This is where your love is supposed to be 
  
 [Verse 2: 2Pac] 
 I let you kiss me where it hurts 
 Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt 
 Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it 
 See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it 
 Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me 
 Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free 
 Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes 
 Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses 
 Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet 
 Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit 
 Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops 
 Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop 
 Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite 
 Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night 
 Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager 
 Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now! 
  
 [Chorus 3: Mary J. Blige] 
 But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy? 
 'Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
 (Young's in the building) 
 I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time 
 To knock the hustle for real 
  
 [Verse 3: Jay-Z] 
 Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock 
 My function is to make much and lay back munching 
 Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch 
 Nothing to stop, un-stoppable 
 Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew 
 I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado 
 My motto, stack rocks like Colorado 
 Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle 
 It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me 
 Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z 
 My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me 
 Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what 
 Straight bananas; can a nigga see me 
 Got the US Open, advantage Jigga 
 Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus 
 Le Tigre, son you're too eager 
 You ain't having it, good me either 
 Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh 
 At my arraignment screaming 
 All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even 
 Thieving, as long as I'm breathing 
 Can't knock the way a playa eating[feat. Foxy Brown] 
 [Jay-Z] 
 What, tssh, y'all, what 
 Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh 
 Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh 
 The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all 
 Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi 
 Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie 
 Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Phillipine thing 
 For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin 
 Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance 
 A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy 
 Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ 
 Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me 
 Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early 
 Cause who's gettin played is not me 
 "Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely 
 Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me" 
 I said maturely, "You right 
 But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds 
 Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story 
 To make sure that you one of a kind 
 And you deserve to be my Sunshine" 
  
 [Chorus: Babyface (variations not listed except for first time)] 
 Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh) 
 Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah) 
 I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh) 
 [Jay-Z, (Foxy Brown)] 
 A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only 
 Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom 
 Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right) 
 Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm 
 Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh) 
 Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said 
 [Foxy Brown, (Jay-Z)] 
 I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressin 
 Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me 
 We chose each other, you actin like you chose me 
 They oppose you then, they oppose me 
 We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery 
 Double cross you they got to triple cross me 
 (I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh 
 (One more thing: 
 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho' 
 (She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh 
 (Put that on everything?) I put that on my life 
 (Right) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 [Jay-Z, (Foxy Brown)] 
 If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho') 
 Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho') 
 Pawn your jewlery to come get me? (You better know) 
 Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know) 
 They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh) 
 They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh) 
 (But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales 
 That you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?) 
 This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail 
 I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale 
 Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell 
 Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself 
 Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf 
 It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt 
 From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine 
 Just continue to be my Sunshine (uhhh)

 Okay 
 House nigga, don't fuck with me 
 I'm a field nigga with shined cutlery 
 Gold-plated quarters where the butlers be 
 I'mma play the corners where the hustlers be 
 I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood 
 That your momma rentin' 
 Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood 
 That's how you rinse it" 
 I bought every V12 engine 
 Wish I could take it back to the beginnin' 
 I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo 
 For like two million 
 That same building today is worth twenty-five million 
 Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

 So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit 
 You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit 
 On to the next one, somebody call the waitress 
 Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do 
 I don't get dropped, I drop the label 
 World can't hold me, too much ambition 
 Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen 
 Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops 
 Meanin I'm on vaca', chillin on a big yacht

 Uhh, +Big Pimpin'+ in the house now 
 Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down 
 Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off 
 Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off 
 Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off 
 Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard 
 Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill 
 Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill 
 Can't chill but my neck will 
 Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal 
 Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets 
 Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects 
 Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps 
 Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best 
 M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text 
 Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next 
 Hold up

 When you think of Jay-Z, what comes to mind? 
  
 [Damon Dash] 
 I think, um… Two things. Roc-a-fella Records. Um, building the brand and the label. And also, the—the brand of Jay-Z. To say, “I weathered the storm. I’m not just a rapper. I’m a—a CEO, I’m a entertainer, um, I’ve done… I have a vodka company, I have a clothing company… Um… I have, uh, 47 employees—um, um—as far as Roc-a-fella Records. And I’m not sta- stopping here. I have a S-Dot Carter shoe coming out, uh… I’m on—I’m doing the first Showtime special ever in fifteen years.” Um… Jay—I don’t think Jay’s done.

 Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was 
 I got you frontin in Armani sweaters 
 Before this rap shit

 And eek classes with mo in the glasses 
 Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's 
 Now all your mens' up in your benz's 
 High post, I swear you be killin me 
 Playin inside my pubic hairs 
 I never worry bout them other chicks 
 Cuz you proved who was your wiz 
 When you was spinnin that bitch 
 I took a little when you was up north 
 Your comisary stay pilin 
 How you livin large on the island 
 All them collects have me vex 
 But when you come home 
 Knew I was comin off wit half of dem checks 
 Now we on the rise 
 Your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes 
 Holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit 
 Fucks no, I see half the dough 
 Made you into a star, pushin hundred thousand dollar cars

 [Kanye West] 
 … Aight! 
 I want y’all niggas to know… 
 That I’m the newest member of the Roc-a-fella team!Lyrics upon releaseYoung Jeezy has officially left Def Jam but the rapper wasn't a free agent for long. His new deal was announced with three simple words, "It's official now." But when you're Hov, you can make boss moves like that with a few words. 
  
 That's right. Young Jeezy is now signed with Jay Z's Roc Nation. Jay Z's official blogsite, LifeAndTimes.com, posted a picture of Jeezy and Hov together, drinking D'usse, with the headline "It's Official Now" and the caption, "CTE x Roc Nation x It's Tha World." 
  
 Jeezy recently went on a Twitter rant about his issues with Def Jam. The rapper even threatened to leak his next album via Twitter. Maybe it was just that time for Jeezy for to move on from the label. 
  
 Interestingly, Jay Z was the one who initially signed Jeezy to Def Jam back in 2005. Jay was serving as the label's president at the time. While president of Def Jam, Jay Z also signed Rihanna who is now signed to Roc Nation. Jay recently signed West Coast artist DJ Mustard to Roc Nation. 
  
 The parameters of the deal between CTE and Roc Nation are unclear at the moment. Rumors have been going around that Jay Z and Jeezy may be joining forces to form a new management company, which will house Jeezy and his artists. 
  
 Jeezy's It's Tha World Vol. 2 is expected to be released November 27th. 
  
 What do you think about this deal? Will they work well together like they did before?EI'm putting together a music festival that blurs those lines of genre. All walks of life and all people can come and it's in the city. It's not in some far off place that you can't get to. No disrespect to any other festivals. No shots. But in the middle of the city, look how beautiful this park is. It's accessible to everyone. It's inclusion. It's not exclusive. It's not something that's far away... We started two years ago in Philadelphia and had huge success and I'm sure we'll have even more success in Los Angeles, we are very proud to be here, very excited.[Chorus]

 Crying every everydayThe trailer for Ron Howard's documentary film about Jay Z's Made In America tour has surfaced online. 
  
 As Billboard reports, the film - which is set to be debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, which runs from September 8 -18 - has also been picked up by US cable network Showtime and will be broadcast on October 11. Showtime entertainment president David Nevins said: "Ron Howard and Jay Z have crafted an inspirational portrayal of American resilience, drive and creativity, interwoven with an incredible showcase of musical talent. We are proud to bring Made In America to Showtime where it joins our impressive roster of provocative and compelling documentaries helmed by award-winning filmmakers." 
  
 Speaking previously about the film, Made In America producer Brian Glazer said: "The festival showcases 20 pre-eminent artists that speak to the new generation. I am producing the film with Steve Stoute and Jay. Ron is directing. It is going to be born through Jay Z's perspective...how he puts the event together." 
  
 Beyonce and Nine Inch Nails are set to headline this year's Budweiser Made In America festival, which takes place in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on August 31 and September 1. 
  
 Other bands set to perform this year include Queens Of The Stone Age, Deadmau5, Phoenix, Calvin Harris, Empire Of The Sun, Wiz Khalifa, Kendrick Lamar, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Public Enemy, Nero, 2 Chainz, The Gaslight Anthem, A$AP Rocky, Walk The Moon, Solange, Emeli Sandé, Haim, Rudimental and AlunaGeorgeDont make me hesite about the word dissipate it means to scatter in various directions when i look in the mirror i see my reflectionsXxJay-Z has partnered with Barneys in New York to create a line of limited edition products inspired by the city. 
  
 The rapper, who released his latest album 'Magna Carta Holy Grail' earlier this year, will work with fashion houses including Balenciaga, Rick Owens, Lanvin and more on the products, which will be named "A New York Holiday". Pitchfork reports the line, "includes blankets, leather backpacks, raincoats, and rings" all of which will be either all black, white, gold or silver. 
  
 The partnership will see Jay Z design an"interactive holiday installation" in the windows of Barneys' Madison Avenue store. All of the New York Holiday products will be showcased and sold in the BNY SCC Gallery, so named after Barneys New York and Sean Corey Carter, from November 20. A quarter of the proceeds made from the products will be donated to the Shawn Carter Foundation. 
  
 Jay Z was recently named on Forbes' list of hip-hop's biggest moneymakers in 2013, a list topped by Diddy. The artist formerly known as 'P Diddy' came out on top of the Cash Kings list of the highest-paid stars in hip-hop after raking in an estimated $50 million (£31.2 million) over the course of the past year. Jay-Z was second in the list, with reported earnings of $43 million (£26.9 million), while Dr Dre was third with $40 million (£25 million).In the past several weeks two separate investigations were launched as a result of the wrongful detention of Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips. My team has been privy to the status of the Barneys third party consultant investigation. In continuing our research, we also contacted the New York State Attorney General’s office for the status of their investigation into both Barneys and Macy’s. Those findings are not yet available. 
  
 While I await the findings of the Attorney General’s Office, I have agreed to move forward with the launch of BNY SCC collection under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling. I am in a unique position to use my voice to affect change to this disturbing issue. The easy position would have been to walk away and leave policy making to others hoping that someone addresses the problem. I will not leave the outcome to others. I will take this into my own hands with full power to recommend, review and revise policies and guidelines moving forward. I am choosing to take this head on. 
  
 As I previously stated, the collaboration with Barneys has always been about giving and The Shawn Carter Foundation. From this collection, the Foundation will receive not only 25% of sales, it will now receive the additional 75% of Barneys’ sales, totalling 100% of all sales from BNY SCC. Along with 100% of sales from the collaboration, the Foundation will receive an additional 10% of all retail sales from Barneys New York stores nationwide and Barneys.com on November 20th.

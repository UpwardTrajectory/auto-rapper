[Verse 1] 
 Flash that buttery gold 
 Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol 
 What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly 
 Not enough young in his lung for the water wings 
 Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch 
 Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt." 
 Fine, sign of the time we elapse 
 When a primate climb up a spine and attach 
 Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines 
 They get a rise out of frogs and flies 
 So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life 
 The mouths water on a fork and knife 
 And the allure isn't right 
 No score on a war-torn beach 
 Where the cash cow's actually beef 
 Blood turns wine when it leak for police 
 Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And I will remember your name and face 
 On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast 
 And I will rejoice in your fall from grace 
 With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." 
 None shall pass, none shall pass 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix 
 You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz 
 How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz 
 ‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch 
 And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss 
 To the jokers who pose by the glitz 
 Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm 
 When a king is a whore who comply and conform 
 Miles outside of the eye of the storm 
 With a siphon to lure out a prize and award 
 While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war 
 True blue triumph is more 
 Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold 
 Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go." 
 Sat where the old, cardboard city folk 
 Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And I will remember your name and face 
 On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast 
 And I will rejoice in your fall from grace 
 With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." 
 None shall pass, none shall pass 
  
 [Interlude] 
 You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me 
 You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve 
 I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you 
 I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this 
 Duty and death; any one object, come stand in the way 
 You could be my little Snake River Canyon today 
 And I ran with a chain of commands 
 And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can 
 Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd 
 When I cut a belly open to find what climb out 
 That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up 
 To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!" 
 It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff 
 'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck 
 And it's a beautiful thing 
 To my people who keep an impressive wingspan 
 Even when the cubicle shrink 
 You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed 
 N.Y. Chew through the machine 
  
 [Chorus] 
 And I will remember your name and face 
 On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast 
 And I will rejoice in your fall from grace 
 With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." 
 None shall pass, none shall pass[Intro: Sample] 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation 
 I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent 
 While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement 
 I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience 
 Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual 
 Dirty cooperative med platoon 
 Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous 
 Fathom the splicing of first generation fuck-up 
 With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!) 
 I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash 
 Duke of early retirement picket dream 
 American Nightmare hogging the screen 
 I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in 
 If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym 
 Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage 
 Merit crutched on the wretched refuse 
 Of my teeming resonance 
 I promise, tempest tossed breed with a bleeding conscience 
 See, the creed accents responsive 
 But my spores divorced the wattage 
 And I'm sleeping now — wow! — yeah, the settlers laugh 
 You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash 
 You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags 
 You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!) 
 Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed 
 So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em 
 His origami dream is beautiful 
 But man, those wings will never leave the ground 
 Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse 
 Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed 
 Divvy crumbs for the better souls 
 With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience 
 The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished 
 Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep 
 Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon 
 I hock spores coursed by the morbid 
 Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel 
 Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle 
 I could zig-zag and zig 'em again 
 For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows 
 Another thick installment of one night in Gotham 
 Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem 
 Attached to the festive batch of city goblins 
 Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow 
 Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow 
 Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus 
 Where all fiddler crabs congregate 
 And get pampered for bickering 
 Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman 
 You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy 
 Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests 
 Or maybe you're just an asshole 
 Who couldn't sweet talk the princess 
 Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold 
 Stomach full of halo kibbles 
 Wings span cast black upon vigils 
 Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels 
 I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace 
 You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast 
 Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion 
 I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him 
  
 [Chorus] 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 And keep on, 'til the break of dawn[Intro] 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
 They did not know how long they had been there 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Look… 
 Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry 
 Zero dark thirty 
 Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild 
 Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines 
 Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes 
 Devolved into mothmen munching textiles 
 Punisher, out past go-time 
 Back 10 fried worms chubbier 
 Brown grass both sides 
 Canned food, manmade tools 
 Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root 
 Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes 
 And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose 
 Can’t gain 
 Smoke out moles like a force of nature 
 Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly 
 Maybe in the form of a nest egg 
 Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray 
 Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate 
 Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day 
 M-m-moral compass all batshit 
 Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets 
 Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict 
 I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you 
 How a thousand virtues 
 Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles 
  
 [Hook] 
 Roving packs of elusive young become 
 Choke-lore writers over boosted drums 
 In the terrifying face of a future tongue 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 (Check his own) Breakneck pulse over colors in a drain 
 That emote sugar skulls in the rain 
 Flower-eyes melting 
 Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting 
 Quarter up and headed for the kill screen 
 No corner cut, no build team 
 Only a particularly menacing 
 Angle perpendicular to everything 
 Boys room cherry bomb 
 Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron 
 Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution 
 Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind 
 Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold 
 Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles 
 Arm in the maw 
 Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall 
 A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause 
 Get stuffed with cartoon cigars 
 Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost 
 Around folk backed into what they most lampoon 
 Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles 
 Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you 
 Fade me, failed all basic training 
 But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling 
 Silhouette,  the god’s last cigarette 
 Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous 
  
 [Hook] 
 Roving packs of elusive young become 
 Choke-lore writers over boosted drums 
 In the terrifying face of a future tongue 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one 
 Down down from a huntable surplus to one[Verse 1] 
 Used to draw 
 Hard to admit that I used to draw 
 Portraiture and the human form 
 Doodle of a two-headed unicorn 
 It was soothin', movin' his arm in a fusion 
 Of man-made tools and a muse from beyond 
 Even if it went beautifully wrong 
 It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong 
 No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom 
 Oozing a brand new cuneiform 
 Barely commune with the horde 
 Got a whole gray scale ungluing his world 
 Might zone out to the yap of the magpie 
 Unseen hand dragging his graphite 
 Cross contour, little bit of backlight 
 Black ink after a Bristol to baptize 
 You can't imagine the rush that ensue 
 When you get three dimensions stuffed into two 
 Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do 
 Being trained and observed by a capable few 
 Back in New York, five peeps and a dog 
 In a two-bedroom doing menial jobs 
 Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod 
 Distractions free to maraud 
 I left some years a deer in the light 
 I left some will to spirit away 
 I let my fears materialize 
 I let my skills deteriorate 
 Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing 
 A mission that was rooted in a 20-year affinity 
 In rickety condition with an ID crisis 
 Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's… 
  
 [Hook] 
 Shapes falling out of the fringe 
 All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 And there were colors pouring out of the fringe 
 All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Used to paint 
 Hard to admit that I used to paint 
 Natural light on a human face 
 Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass 
 It was blooming addiction 
 Amiss in the pushing of pigment 
 Book like a tattooed pigskin, look 
 Pinhead kids of the minute 
 Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic 
 And it grew up into linseed oil over linen 
 Joy to the poison, voice of the resin 
 Capture a map of the gesture 
 Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure 
 Redo that, move that inward 
 Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers 
 Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures 
 Stay tuned for the spooky adventures 
 You can't imagine the stars that align 
 When a forearm starts foreshortening right 
 Or a torso hung on a warping spine 
 In proportion reads as warm and alive 
 Routine day with a dirt cheap brush 
 Then a week goes by and it goes untouched 
 Then two, then three, then a month 
 And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up 
 I left some seasons eager to fall 
 I left some work to bury alive 
 I let my means of being dissolve 
 I let my person curl up and die 
 Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety 
 Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy 
 Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas 
 Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's… 
  
 [Hook] 
 Shapes falling out of the fringe 
 All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 And there were colors pouring out of the fringe 
 All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
  
 [Outro] 
 I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding 
 Where is the truth you promised?![Chorus: Aesop Rock] 
 We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies 
 We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee 
 No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies 
 We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 And the last shall be 
 First to immerse in the pass out heat 
 Face in the mud where the moxie melt 
 'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell 
 More in a cave with a torch on the wall 
 Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls 
 On a brand new day, saw what he saw 
 Property owners who crawl to the mall 
 With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law 
 Pace like he mourning a loss 
 Right hand on a can of worms 
 Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean 
 That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day 
 But a model of mercy and might, no way 
 Marionette who will clap and obey 
 Dude, look, all that noise 
 Call that flight of the water boys 
 Meet and greet and they all slap five 
 Cheek to cheek when they colonize 
 And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish 
 Walk that path with a dime and a stick 
 Walk that path with a diamond and wine 
 Walk that path to the firing line 
 Just walk, pay no mind 
 To the new recruit with the play-doh spine 
 Let's be friends from opposite ends 
 Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence 
 Play to the radius far and away 
 Orbit wide don't park in his space 
 One little martyr who talk in his face 
 Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock] 
 We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies 
 We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee 
 No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies 
 We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go 
  
 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 And the last shall be 
 First to the curb with the mad cow meat 
 Face in the bars of a regular cell 
 When he woke up high in collectible hell 
 Boom town kid who was taught by the binge 
 That a man who expire with the most shit win 
 That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich 
 Not a routine friend in a pinch 
 Still not used to the stench 
 How it throws off otherwise lucid events 
 In the case the afraid observe 
 I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes 
 Hey, peace, pray for the plagued 
 Major relief and capacious rains 
 But just cuz I don't want to war with you 
 It don't mean go warm up the barbecue 
 I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit 
 My high noon is a quick little minute 
 I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic 
 Who simply isn't going to ever really get it 
 This HQ is alive and alone 
 No driveway no sign of a home 
 No dial tone, no line for the phone 
 No world's tiniest violin song 
 And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue 
 With a deep breath hiding and bored 
 Fighting a smile, highly annoyed 
 When the timing is right I will rise and record 
 Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got 
 Animal drums like he's doctor teeth 
 It goes red light green light 1 2 3 
 One large coffee, fuck you, peace 
  
 [Bridge: Aesop Rock]

 [Outro: John Darnielle] 
 I crawled down to the basement 
 When the weather got cold 
 Like a lost lamb returning to the fold 
 And when the outside world recedes from view 
 It's just a year's supply of make-up 
 And memories of you 
 1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires 
 Keeping me alive 
 There's an envelope with some cash in it 
 Out by the front door 
 This is what they make you take the medication for[Verse 1] 
 Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts 
 Poolside, O for 1 and don't forget spoons twice 
 Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie 
 Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies 
 Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning 
 My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat 
 To Mom "It's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half" 
 She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body" 
 She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday" 
 Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter 
 Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway? 
 Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats 
 Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past 
 Except it doesn't always work like that 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt 
 Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn 
 I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric; 
 You are healthy, you are special, you are present" 
 Then I let them go 
 Oh... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions 
 I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards 
 In the mirror sweating pitchers; who's there: simian or lizard? 
 As it were there is a disappearing difference 
 In ambition and material; 
 Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol 
 Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius' 
 I'm a... That's better, here we here we go 
 Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill 
 Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized 
 Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized 
 Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying 
 It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? Don't play 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark 
 Where the grape vines climb a convenient barn 
 I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; 
 You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded" 
 Then I let them go 
 Oh.. 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I have been completely unable to maintain 
 Any semblance of relationship on any level 
 I have been a bastard to the people who have 
 Actively attempted to deliver me from peril 
 I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up 
 And lip that kissed me on the temple 
 I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition 
 That admits it wish its history disassembled 
 I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance 
 While skimming for a ministry to pretzel 
 I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish 
 That acted different when the bidding was essential 
 I have been a terrible communicator 
 Prone to isolation over sympathy for devils 
 I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels 
  
 [Hook 3] 
 Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand 
 Where the low tide showcased a promised land 
 I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; 
 You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive" 
 Then I let them go 
 Oh 
  
 (On and on and on and on...)[Hook] 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid 
 Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage 
 9 weeks awesome, hides in a slipper 
 Look in her eye like she might be a wizard 
 Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot 
 She got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box 
 And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox 
 Swap 20 on the spot and cop the warlock 
 Back at the haunt, found god in the hamper 
 Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther 
 Good around misery and golden era samplers 
 Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers 
 Bet, more than a pet to worship 
 It's an MD recommended sense of purpose 
 Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria 
 Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors 
  
 [Hook] 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there (I'm not takin' no shorts) 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Why'd you eat that leaf 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch 
 Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish 
 Skittish in the company of stranger danger 
 Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers 
 In a steel cage match with a maze of cables 
 Brazen, game-face based on Azazel 
 Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix 
 Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick 
 [slurp]: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli 
 Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly 
 Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment 
 Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken 
 Mouser in training, nap on the toaster 
 Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker 
 15 years taking prescriptions 
 Now a shrink like, "Ionno, maybe get a kitten" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there[Verse 1] 
 Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage 
 Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face? 
 I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain 
 I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste 
 The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch 
 Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux 
 Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks 
 Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed 
 It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants 
 Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants 
 Each one separately convinced 
 They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands 
 Delusion turned the communication to prison camp 
 You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause 
 There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost 
 I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts 
 Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves 
  
 Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there 
  
 [Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth] 
 Don't need no help, all by myself 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene 
 It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe 
 Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive 
 I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe 
 I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong 
 The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog 
 That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws 
 Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs 
 In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry 
 I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling 
 God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys 
 Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach 
 You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art 
 You can't be cooler than the corners 
 Where you source all your parts 
 The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks 
 We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark 
  
 Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there 
  
 [Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth] 
 Don't need no help, all by myself 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose 
 Insecurities exploding in emotional code 
 When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross 
 Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost 
 Before the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell 
 You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle 
 The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill 
 But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell 
 In a whistle and bell-o-rama 
 Black mollies that dress up like piranha 
 It's not even compelling melodrama 
 It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga 
 I'm very voluntarily persona non grata 
 You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need 
 This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed 
 I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen 
 Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means 
  
 Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there 
  
 [Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth] 
 Don't need no help, all by myself[Verse 1] 
 Tech support, feral army 
 In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming 
 Four corners of paranormal 
 Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals 
 In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles 
 St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle 
 Circle the source of his power 
 Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale 
 Cherry pick blue in the pale 
 It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat 
 Schmoozing a high and head-rush 
 Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some 
 One eye on the breadcrumbs 
 Other eye on the Drencrom 
 Other other eye on the income 
 Good knife and a grin 
 Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms 
 Peg leg, smells like Medellin wake in the night 
 Make a pipe out of anything 
 Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane 
 Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8 
 Back out, black out somewhere fancy 
 Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude... 
 Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt 
 In the end, if you give an address in a river of piss 
 Don't question the mystery fish 
 Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits 
 Close your eyes, lick your lips 
 I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh 
 Sarah gave me 2, I gave one to Rex 
 He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs 
 They could never understand what Sumner is" 
  
 [Chorus] 
 (Word up, word up, word up) 
 I'm off the grid 
 I'm through the gate 
 I fly these kites into the fray 
 (Word up, word up, word up) 
 I'm out the box 
 I'm through the mud 
 I fly these kites into the cut 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 NorCal fried bacteria 
 No ID survive the vivarium 
 Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin 
 Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim 
 Might hold court with the cats and dogs 
 Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw 
 In terry cloth robes outside detox surly 
 Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee 
 Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man 
 Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants 
 Oooh, never could avoid himself 
 For long enough to contain or employ as help 
 And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt 
 Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved 
 Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring" 
 From a fortune to Fisher King 
 Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair 
 New day, new diary of disrepair 
 Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear 
 No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year 
 I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6 
 He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch 
 It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug 
 Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug 
 Outside home is an open swim 
 Occultism in the throws of corrosive wind 
 A cold meal with the ghosts of friends 
 A whole host of meds, a deal on a Tone Loc cassette 
 I stepped over a body in the door 
 I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn 
 Profound apathy, heart with a crack 
 I'm ships in the night, I'm darts at a map 
 Word up[Verse 1] 
 My first name is a random set of numbers and letters 
 And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever 
 My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole 
 To a susurrus, it couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo 
 My address a made-up language written out in living glyphs 
 Lifted from demonic literature and religious text 
 Telephone uncovered by purveyors of the ouija 
 Then checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti 
 My social a sudoku, my age is obscure 
 My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies chasing birds 
 Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores 
 And people who open doors for the people who open doors 
 My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo 
 Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow 
 Nervous in the service still, I'm burger meat and purple pills 
 "Here," "Thank you, we'll call your name," "Sure you will." 
  
 [Interlude] 
 Skipped lunch 
 I'm shrunk 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room 
 You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth 
 Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf 
 In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others 
 In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt 
 Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel 
 I'm half a human, combin' over Home and Garden stoned 
 Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne 
 A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal 
 Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball 
 Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu 
 I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku, uh-oh 
 That pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji 
 If you save up all your winnings then you get to count your blessings 
 I finally crunched the budget up and punched the button 
 She called my name out and pushed me into an oven 
  
 [Interlude] 
 The fuck? 
 I'm shrunk 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 She says, "I'm not your enemy." 
 I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say." 
 Instead of playing off the chemistry 
 She said, "You're being difficult." I said, "I'm being guarded 
 You're a quarter-mil in debt, I get more guidance from my barber 
 Look, I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie-fest 
 You built your walls up high 
 Or said goodbye to all your Cooky-Puss 
 Here's one: every time my telephone buzzes 
 I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds." 
 She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic 
 It's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic." 
 I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic 
 I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation." 
 Okay, agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans 
 Honoring the push and pull, I should've called the Scholomance 
 Oh well, preservation is a doozy 
 "Will you be needing another appointment?" "Absolutely" 
 I'm shrunk![Verse 1] 
 Yep, steps up to the plate 
 Little brother, Little League, '87 he was 8 
 Rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of T-ball 
 Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off 
 Church, then a grip of loons run to 3rd first 
 Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search 
 Seen MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher 
 Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure 
 "Hi, Peggy!" I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart 
 Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm 
 Knees bent, two out, two on bags 
 When I caught him staring down 
 At something moving through the grass 
 Hold up, tagged runner and the whole cast rotate 
 Not before he could identify the culprit 
 Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" Graham yelling, "Gopher!" 
 New left fielder give a fuck about a homer 
 Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel 
 No baseball in the bubble, ruh-roh 
 Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit 
 Inning crawling to a close, head coach not amused 
 Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond 
 Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him 
 When he transverse 3rd, the families turn nervous 
 The following is a transcript of man vs. vermin 
 Here we go: man stands out by a hole 
 Pest pops up to patrol 
 Man plays live Whac-a-Mole 
 In a scene that would try every child as adults 
 Whoa, pallbearer with a ball mitt 
 Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench 
 Both teams lose, "Good game, good game" 
 Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", Cubs ain't playing 
  
 [Pre-hook 1] 
 My little brother is a funny dude 
 A lot of funny shit happened to him 
 My other brother pretty funny too 
 Ain't seen him in a minute though 
  
 [Hook] 
 Just in case of rough waters 
 I want to put one up for my brothers 
 Just in case of rough waters 
 I want to put one up for my brothers 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yep, not a part of the machine 
 Big brother, big idea, '9-0, 16 
 Neubauten tee, plaid-flannel-laden, adolescent art kid 
 Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim 
 And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend 
 Peel Sessions in a Christian home for field testing 
 It's real youth in the palm of your hand 
 When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band 
 We were buried in the Village Voice 
 Checking who was playing where 
 Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear 
 5 words, like a beacon of light in the mist: "Ministry live at the Ritz" 
 It was "Christ Has Risen" to Chris, 3 loaves, 2 fish 
 Miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch 
 Coming to a theater, he would be there in the flesh 
 Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes" 
 Cop tickets, ah, the plot thickens 
 Countdown to ultimate concert experience 
 Ma still wary: "And why are they called Ministry? 
 Are they a cult?" Maybe she would properly investigate 
 Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview 
 Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three 
 That's all, no fair trial 
 Simply, "You will not be going to the show and that's final!" 
 What occurred next were the top of the lungs 
 Of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved 
 In a moment that would transcend anger to high art 
 Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!" 
 Can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom? 
 Anyway, no body count, no concert 
 And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse 
  
 [Pre-hook 2] 
 My older brother is a funny dude 
 A lot of funny shit happened to him 
 We hadn't spoken in a couple moons 
 I called him last night, "How you doing?" 
  
 [Hook] 
 Just in case of rough waters 
 I want to put one up for my brothers 
 Just in case of rough waters 
 I want to put one up for my brothers[Verse 1] 
 Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs 
 Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump 
 Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once—pale horse painted gunmetal black 
 Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat 
 Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span 
 Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading 
 For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37 
 2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 buses 
 Fireproof and festive 
 Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign 
 Knows no zen in the art of maintenance 
 Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby 
 Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone 
  
 [Hook] 
 Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief 
 Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep 
 Gangway - mind eyes, mind teeth 
 Gangway - mind eyes, mind teeth 
 Gangway - mind eyes, mind teeth 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The man-ape translates glam thru the visor 
 Goes in water lillies 
 Am-scrays Giger, and man—ray 
 Crammed in a one-player campaign 
 Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain 
 Span where the praying hands mandate 
 Bars an extension of the arms 
 They're mutating instead of being farmed 
 Tonight beneath a marmalade venus 
 Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us 
 Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus 
 All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused 
 Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly 
 And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee 
 Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring 
 And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie 
 The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy 
  
 [Hook] 
 Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief 
 Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep 
 Gangway - mind eyes, mind teeth 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It was less of an act of hubris 
 More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet 
 Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia 
 Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer 
 I crowbar into the pecking order 
 The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers 
 Hug a double yellow spine 
 Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope 
 Those little fuckers run on passion alone 
 This is the product of a d.i.y. inadequate home 
 Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge 
 Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome 
 Traffic amassed against insufferable odds 
 Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone 
 I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me 
 All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling 
 Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil 
 PS - I wrote this on a self-destructing memo...[Verse 1] 
 Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress 
 Composed themselves enough to artfully carve "Zoso" in his desk 
 They was probably thinking "fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" in they head 
 With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash 
 Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock 
 And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk 
 Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked 
 Taking the name of the father in vain 
 On the way to the blade in his locker 
 Estranged 
 A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer 
 Who'd branched off into ninja stars 
 And never knew his shit was sharked to 
 Here with a higher purpose 
 And a prime alert to juvenile berserkers 
 Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw 
 Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar 
 Watch 
 Capital Zed, slowly maneuver the O 
 S is the most difficult to control 
 Finally O 
 Into the eye of Goliath you go 
 That levy crushin' percussion'll pull the monkey upright 
 Twelve or ghetto blaster 
 Black or technicolor telecaster 
 Lecture at a faster rate than class was making them develop backwards 
 It would appear you spelled out all the answers 
  
 [Hook] 
 When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like 
 Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like 
 Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding 
 When they ask how you, living you, tell em you, living like 
 Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like 
 Something even more important arrived giving 
 Something you should probably try willing 
  
 (alright, same here) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust 
 Composed themselves enough to magic-marker “Zulu” on these chucks 
 They was tryin to do the buckle font from ‘Renegades of Funk‘ 
 In a 3d frame of exploding brick 
 And whiz-lines for the locally motion sick 
 Beyond gross but evoked a host of “oh dip” 
 Where a social neurosis owned the whole strip 
 Heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth 
 In the marrow of waiting his guardians out 
 Flashlight 
 Chisel tips 
 Milked venom 
 Pistol grip 
 Images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick 
 Silent agreement at hand 
 King of the hill for a queen of the damned 
 She in the doorway seething began 
 “That clean white pair had a 3-year plan” 
 Oops 
 Capital “ZED” Radical “U” in the cut 
 Truly to beautiful “L"oser it up "U" and he done 
 Collateral damage a future alum that key to Shambala 
 Planet rocking Bambaata 
 Sample chop 
 Churning out a cancer for the vandal squad 
 Analog 
 And he finds 
 Animated colors on a page 
 Like synthesized cultures on a stage 
  
 [Hook] 
 When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like

 [Verse 3] 
 Somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve 
 Composed themselves enough to publicize "the Zeros" in this stall 
 They was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled 
 With a festering hate for the gum drop edge 
 ‘Disco sucks’ tee, punk‘s not dead 
 But a transient teen unsung godsend 
 Via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin 
 (Cheese!) 
 Sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority, thumbing it's nose 
 Cutting it's teeth 
 Pretzled up in special order vinyl, and 
 Birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills 
 2 dutch at a show in the front, low-key to the can 
 For a smoke and a fuck, Trixie, fixing her lipstick up 
 When his mitts got bit by the mischief bug 
 Snatch 
 Capital “zed”, terrible “e” in vermillion red 
 Gimme an “R", "O” and a slippery “s” 
 Over a web of the shittiest bands 
 That beat your heart out 
 Never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve 
 Of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns 
 Urgently 
 Offered through the circuits of an earlier plot 
 I’ll see you at the bottom ZZZ top[Sample] 
 I  see how y'all be trying to front, man y'all be fronting, man 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 Been a bit since Mu died 
 Been a lot more loss in the wake 
 I recall thinking, "Someday 
 Someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect" 
 And I just couldn't fathom 
 Blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction 
 Each claim individual peaks and pockets 
 Pains and a slew of unique nuances 
 Nahmean? When you wake up 8 years non-responsive 
 It's a lot to process 
 Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box 
 To a package of clogged up chakras 
 Oh shazbat, not the "ever after" he wanted 
 From the "once upon a time, "dot, dot, dot 
 Once upon a time he was so much more 
 Than a punchline for his own potshots 
 Ah, Watch the Impossible Kid 
 Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit 
 If I zoom on out I can finally admit 
 It's all been a blur since Mu got sick 
 None of the subsequent years stood a chance 
 Whether you his moms or his mans 
 Whether you his pops or his girl 
 I was poison, heart full of canines, head full of voices 
 Whole life trying to quiet 'em down 
 Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown 
 Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay 
 True friendship in a tugboat way 
 A go dark in the face of the fucked 
 When the fucked was a friend I was basically done 
 Into the woods go his alien tongue 
 It was that or a textbook faking of funk and I can't 
 Here go the hindsight 
 8 years been one long blindside 
 I could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred 
 'Cause he never really healed from the first 
 Oh what a world, any hack is a myth 
 Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick 
 Any graph is a hoax, ease on down 
 I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out 
 Knowing ain't half the battle 
 That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole 
 You can own what you are 
 And still sit around stoned in your car 
 Not doing shit, halfway to nil 
 Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills 
 Get out the car, Aes[Verse 1] 
 Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes 
 City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets 
 Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street 
 The many faces of the various locals that she would meet 
 There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block 
 Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop 
 There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle 
 She always gave a wave and holler 
 On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor 
 And she drew 
 Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds 
 And she drew 
 Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns 
 Always said hello to passersby 
 They'd ask her why she passed her time 
 Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile 
 Now all the other children living in or near her building 
 Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants 
 They would say 
 "Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?" 
 Lucy would pause, look, grin and say 
 "I'm busy, thank you much" 
 Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not 
 She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk 
 And she stopped- 
 "Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?" 
 She said: 
 "I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away 
  
 [Chorus] 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat 
 Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in 
 She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip 
 Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks 
 And she drew 
 Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch 
 And she drew 
 The mailman, delivered everyday at 4 
 Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day 
 But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way 
 She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit 
 They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose 
 They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too 
 So they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew 
 (Look!) 
 Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door 
 Just one of the neighbors 
 Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really 
 Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?" 
 Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much" 
 And they would make a weird face the second the door shut 
 And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was 
 And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care 
 Cuz while they spread their rumors through the street 
 She'd paint another masterpiece 
  
 [Chorus] 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Lucy was 87, upon her death bed 
 At the senior home, where she had previously checked in 
 Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest 
 Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen 
 And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn 
 Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on 
 Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall 
 And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all 
 No Rico, he had passed, about 5 years back 
 So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing 
 She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life 
 Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside 
 And she said: 
 "Look, I've never had a dream in my life 
 Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued 
 I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done 
 So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!" 
 Well! 
 The nurse jumped back 
 She'd never heard Lucy even talk 
 Especially words like that 
 She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind 
 Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures 
 And she died 
  
 [Chorus] 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
 1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed 
 A-B-C, that's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
  
 1-2-3... 
 A-B-C...[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure 
 As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter 
 Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end 
 Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen 
 X-O, Zodiac a pentagram expo 
 Pet Cemetery in electric fresco 
 Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley 
 With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae 
 Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine 
 Guards like, "All signs correlate with sorcery" 
 It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power 
 And defecting shortly after 
 Fist bump dry land, brackish 
 Cat nap 15, back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh 
 Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit 
  
 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right! 
 Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy 
 Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR 
 Ringer off, canned peas, cabin fever mi amor 
 Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door 
 To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce 
 Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros 
 Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors 
 To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy 
 Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz 
 Sleep apnea, scratching, "bring that beat back" 
 I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag 
 Shhh... Om nom, nom, blinds drawn 
 Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones 
 Mangy, intimately spaced pylons 
 On a plot of inhospitable terrain, "Hi mom!"

 Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis 
 Rain forks into mutton, no abort button 
 Core pump, assorted color sugar water 
 Poor lummox, unexplained ailments and doesn't work well with others 
 Wet nose on the glass, Garibaldi half cookie dough 
 Lock jaw, Don 4 walls like a wooden coat 
 Behold the rotting fruit of excommunication: 
 A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases 
 That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement 
 Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement 
 Grace of a misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream 
 The ambush predator edition 
 Skill set of Will Tell aim and speed over short distance 
 Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat 
 Dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack

 Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed 
 Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds 
 Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement 
 So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe 
 They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections 
 And twelve steps to lesson 
 Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts 
 The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness 
 Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus 
 And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs 
 Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics 
 Life treats the peasants like 
 They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside 
 Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems 
 When the clock strikes nine 
 I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players 
 For the cycle of it 
 Under a dusted angel heart string Big Brother is watching 
 My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth 
 We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts 
 We on some door-to-door now 
 Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free 
 I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies 
 For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that" 
 So we can retain baby fat 
 Make the biter snake bedlam 
 Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet 
 Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon 
 Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, end it 
 It's on like it's never been 
 It's bleeding well 
 It's bigger than a breadbox 
 It corrodes my leaky finance 
 I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge 
 With a Coke and a bag of chips 
 To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because 
 The first one slipped 
 Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks 
 I tend to underestimate my average 
 Just another bastard savage 
 Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand 
 Cuz every dog has its day 
 At which point, I'll pull it away 
  
 [Hook] 
 Now we the American working population 
 Hate the fact that eight hours a day 
 Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us 
 And we may not hate our jobs 
 But we hate jobs in general 
 That don't have to do with fighting our own causes 
 We the American working population 
 Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out 
 When we'd rather be supporting ourselves 
 By being paid to perfect the pastimes 
 That we have harbored based solely on the fact 
 That it makes us smile if it sounds dope 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's the year of the silkworm 
 Everything I built burned yesterday 
 Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve 
 Elevate the spreading of the silk germ 
 Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead 
 Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal 
 Saddle up on high horse 
 My torch forced Polaris embarrassed 
 Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage 
 I bought some new sneakers 
 I just hope my legacy matches 
 It's the year of the landshark 
 Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water 
 They're out there being slaughtered 
 In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother 
 And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters 
 Man it's the year of the Orphan 
 Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches 
 Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met 
 But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat 
 Maybe it's the year of the waterbug 
 Cockroach utter thug specimen 
 Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin 
 I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in 
 I've been the object of your ridicule 
 You've been a bitch lieutenant 
 God, it's the year of the underpaid employee 
 Spittin' forty plus a week 
 And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time 
 You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough 
 So you can run run run 
 And I'mma let you think you won 
 EVERYBODY! 
  
 [Hook] 
 We the American working population 
 Hate the fact that eight hours a day 
 Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us 
 And we may not hate our jobs 
 But we hate jobs in general 
 That don't have to do with fighting our own causes 
 We the American working population 
 Hate the nine to five day-in day-out 
 But we'd rather be supporting ourselves 
 By being paid to perfect the pastimes 
 That we have harbored based solely on the fact 
 That it makes us smile if it sounds dope 
  
 [Outro] 
 Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen 
 Pour myself a cup of ambition and 
 Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and 
 If I never make it home today, God bless 
 Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen 
 Pour myself a cup of ambition and 
 Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and 
 If I never make it home today, God bless[Intro] 
 Day turns night, day turns night 
 Day turns night, day turns night 
 Day turns night, day turns night 
 Day turns night, day turns night 
 Night Light, sucka!!! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation 
 I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation 
 While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement 
 I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen 
 Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame 
 Dirty cooperative med platoon 
 Bloom, head-trip split fantastic! 
 Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life 
 With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla! 
 I pace my game for zero-hour completion 
 See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker 
 American nightmare lost in the monitor 
 I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through 
 Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you 
 It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!" 
 Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck 
 Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish 
 See, the freaks sucked out the wattage 
 While three bears invade the cottage 
 And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh 
 You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash 
 You won't be laughing when you're hosted 
 By the ghost of Christmas past 
 You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass 
 I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed 
 So I staple-gun 'em to my feet 
 This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap 
 But you really can't do a thing with that 
  
 [Hook] 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species 
 Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches 
 Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin' 
 (Day turns night) 
 Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light 
 Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light 
 Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light 
 Night Light, sucka!!! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm pretty sure I got a pulse 
 Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed 
 Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!) 
 With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience 
 The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat 
 Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit 
 Set a course, then push the button 
 I swallow spores born by the laws 
 Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel 
 I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone) 
 Zig-zag and zig 'em again 
 Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out 
 Another thick installment of one night in Gotham 
 Like, "Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!" 
 Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow? 
 Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow! 
 I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes 
 Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch 
 Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace 
 Out searching for the g-spot 
 Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests 
 Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole! 
 Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*) 
 Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold 
 Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views 
 Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood 
 I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace 
 You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast 
 Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion 
 I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him 
  
 [Hook] 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

 Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night 
 Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night[Verse 1] 
 Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden 
 Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market 
 All God's critters hold positions 
 Some are violent, some are victims 
 Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support 
 So when the piranhas honor New York 
 My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport 
 And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings 
 It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs 
 The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for 
 The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole 
 Two-track braniac using the food and payroll 
 To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso 
 And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient 
 As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba 
 If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship 
 He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking... 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Pigs! 
 God damn... pigs! 
 Potbelly... pigs! 
 Punch-drunk... pigs! 
 Take money, money... pigs! 
 Loudmouth... pigs! 
 Wide load... pigs! 
 Let's make a deal... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 When all the wolves in woolly wigs 
 Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks 
 The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs 
 Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks 
 As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness 
 We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison 
 I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed 
 No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers 
 I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers 
 Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice 
 Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples 
 And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles 
 Bougie this and Bougie that... 
 War pig or pussy cat... 
 Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps 
 Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money 
 Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle 
 And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes 
 I know that that's one ugly fucking tie 
 Asshole... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes 
 Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive 
 I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter 
 To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner 
 Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning 
 As the misery was dormant and digging in crispy portions 
 Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him 
 Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard 
 When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig? 
 Mine, plus I toss a token where I go: 
 Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow 
 This little piggy went to the market with a target 
 And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers 
 Final words for the finer birds taking notes: 
 I dig a chick in pig tails, "That's all Folks!" 
  
 [Hook][Kimya Dawson] 
 Birds of a black 
 Black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you 
 And all of the shit you do 
 They pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too 
 Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black 
 Without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask 
 When you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh? 
 Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards 
 The silouettes are fencing lefty scissors 
 Separating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators 
 They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors 
 Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon 
 Dead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk! 
 Shifter shit, brother was a face card 
 Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase... 
 Wait up let me isolate the bass more 
 Gate of god's acre 
 Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here 
 Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom 
 Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit 
 Prisoners, tradition is for lovers 
 God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some ‘dip or play the dozens‘ 
 Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records 
 On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders 
 And the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous 
 Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is 
 Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately 
 Publicly your shadows'll cat call back 
 Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll 
 Crack the crypt 
 Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege 
 Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards 
 I'll even grit my teeth for you 
 I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me 
 It's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean" 
 Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young 
 Could've used a good lung 
 Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors 
 Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin 
 "remember that cow in the dean's office seems awkward 
 And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it? 
 Maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines 
 Either way - dope stone lion 
  
 [Kimya Dawson] 
 And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box 
 The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box 
 Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot 
 I'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot 
 You can let them let you rot, man 
 But I'm not going to watch 
 I'm not gonna stand atop your plot 
 I love you friends, but I'm just not 
 On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea 
 I will swim in the sea and you'll be with me 
 And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree 
 I will climb that tree 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Everything you think you're hiding shows 
 In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones 
 Messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks 
 You don't want the passengers to pass 
 You want each cow taxidermy'd fatter than the last 
 Mausoleum lighting is a rush 
 While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch 
 A proud chest puffed to the heavens 
 Holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon 
 And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...[Verse 1] 
 The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins 
 Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar 
 I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle 
 Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel 
 He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft 
 He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats 
 Thanks; I like it too but modestly confess 
 In present company, my coloring is not the main event 
 Look at that neck 
 The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks 
 I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists 
 So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important 
 Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar 
 Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order 
 I should give a shit less 
 Cherry-No; Whip-Yes 
  
 [Hook] 
 Lotta years 
 Uh, lotta years 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The girl that work down at the local juice place 
 Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist 
 I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes 
 My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great 
 Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks 
 She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop 
 "It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em 
 Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em" 
 My mind's fucking blown 
 The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old 
 I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work 
 I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first 
 These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church 
 You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb 
 You should have seen me in the 80s 
 I was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades 
  
 [Hook] 
 Lotta years 
 Naw mean? Lotta years[Intro: Various Samples] 
 [Give him one of these pills if he has any pain] 
 [A parable....What is it? Well it's a little story with a lot of truth 
 An earthly story with a heavenly meaning 
 Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike 
 He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand 
 So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...] 
 [Yeah!] 
  
 [Verse Intro: Aesop Rock] 
 They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus 
 'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks 
 Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke 
 Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost 
 [I knew it!] 
  
 [Verse: Aesop Rock] 
 Holy smokes! 
 Father, black suit white collar 
 Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter's 
 Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia 
 You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck [Oh my!] 
 Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun 
 And mommy's mad I'm cliche generation X agnostic front 
 It ain't the nifty fate, the 1958, before the New-New Testament-approved Altar-boy fisting rape 
 And "take me to your leader" 
 Long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver [Leave him alone!] 
 Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn't God's demeanor 
 Sodom-meter peaking [Me too!] 
 But Long Island was Jesus every weekend 
 Spoon-fed to appease traditional love bringing 
 Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement 
 Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?) 
 One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE 
 So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they SAW 
 Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy 
 But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies 
 Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags 
 And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies [Well...] 
 Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies 
 Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs! 
 By the time I was old enough to know what religion was 
 I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a [FUCK!] 
 '94: Moved out the crib and it ain't seen a steeple since 
 What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch 
 'Till priests' laps slapped with parental advisory warnings 
 I'll be auditioning Gods in my office on Monday morning 
  
 [Hook: Various Samples & Aesop Rock] 
 [Yeah!] {Scratched throughout chorus} 
 Uh oh! And yet another pill slipped 
 Down the hatch and pass 'em through the kill-switch 
  
 I need a couple A's for Q's 
 I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
  
 [Interlude: Sampled] 
 [This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and 
 Helpful to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people: 
 'Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food. When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.' 
 But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you? 
 Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered: 
 'In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren 
 You have done it unto me.'] 
 [Yeah!] 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Just a little bruise in the back of the pews 
 Acting amused with a mask and them Vatican blues 
 For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in 
 Aes' is just another sinning brick in Hell's basement 
 Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists 
 For what? Drugs and fucking, It's part of growing up 
 Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools 
 I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
 Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews 
 Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud 
 I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme 
 So its a no-brainer "peace" when the blood hit the screen 
 Got a basic good and evil sensibility born 
 Good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns 
 I'm more science than faith, I'm more karma than bread and booze 
 I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
 Not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
 Not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
 Not an asshole I'm just a little confused 
  
 (You know what? To be completely honest, Aesop, you're a fucking asshole)[Intro] 
 Well, so we meet again 
 (He said he's grown spiritually 
 Since the last time we'd spoken) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects 
 Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh 
 Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad 
 Black horse and buggy mechanisms 
 Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision) 
 The gathering of loose ends in a bucket 
 With a shoestring budget 
 Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now) 
 But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen 
 Fee fie et cetera 
 I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin' 
 I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone 
 I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home 
 I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention 
 By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences 
 Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering 
 And when the groom presents the ring 
 The bride commence the blistering 
 It's textbook magnificently crude 
 Prototype king berserker module 
 Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure) 
 Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow 
 Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure) 
 Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous 
 Beautiful cartoon troopers 
 Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar 
 I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim 
 Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame 
 Merit badge, marksman, or poacher? 
 It's all the same (right?) 
 So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain 
  
 [Hook] 
 I wanna be a big bang, gotta be 
 Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir 
 YES SIR! 
 Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone 
 Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn 
 Big bang, Shoveling a big dig 
 Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things 
 I'ma burn with this little light of mind 
 And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

 Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things

 And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population 
 Bottle neck effect, sorta born def 
 Alien to shallow alchemy 
 If you gon' metamorph the base-metal to precious 
 Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants 
 I'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window 
 Left an S.O.S. infested bottle nestled in his grip so 
 With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow 
 I observed him fly ten feet 
 Then drop the bottles to the devils 
 Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment 
 Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson 
 If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim 
 There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system 
 Sticky panoramic contaminant planted 
 In conjunction with phantom assumption 
 Gutterbug alumnus candidates 
 Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse 
 Just to help guide in your ship 
 If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch) 
 Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach 
 To circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly 
 From a B.C. generation disgust 
 Community movement alluding to a 
 "No blood given, no recognition" 
 Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer 
 Trying to build a fence around these magic beans 
 My dreams have gathered 
 But to, that certain lack of avail 
 I sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks) 
  
 [Hook] 
 I wanna be a big bang, gotta be

 It's gettin' bigger by the second 
 Check it 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the elders farewell 
 I shook the buddy system wisdom 'til the similars repel 
 I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals 
 I'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem) 
 I don't really believe in God 
 But God, I'm scared to death of God 
 I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans 
 Nor tear the pod 
 But it's like... 
 I hike an acre unimpressed and slept on the saber's edge 
 Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge 
 I wanna know myself 
 Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves 
 And still my shepherd can't administer 
 The proper push and pulls 
 I push the ghouls to man overboard 
 Pull the bulls onto my sword 
 And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor 
 Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar 
 Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over 
 The recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity 
 By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully) 
 I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers 
 Cauterize the wound and heads like 
 "Gimme gimme something major" 
 Road side prophetic, ascend well (well) 
 Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system 
 Blistering in a wishing well 
 BIG BANG![Verse 1] 
 I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie 
 Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em 
 They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's 
 Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms 
 Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles 
 Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes 
 Zook slipped through the pinholes 
 Crispy the God sender 
 Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender 
 Both the formal squad censor, look down 
 Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars 
 My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares 
 Gas for Huntington and back barely 
 Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss 
 And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit 
 The kid piloted his ring king dummies to King Kullen 
 Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs 
 What's this 
 A couple spray cans and a little litter 
 But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters 
 So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props 
 But things will still go bump when them halogens pop 
 Believe I'll be there when it happens 
 The shaking of the plates off the mantle 
 The snaking of the flames off the candle 
 The lady of the lake off the answers 
 Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers 
 Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to 
 Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency 
 Damn doggy, good times, thanks 
 I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks 
 What's this 
  
 [Refrain] 
 I'm an activator 
 Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later 
 Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor 
 When the towns speed freaks sleep 
 Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers 
 What's this 
 Say I'm an activator 
 Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre 
 By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor 
 When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators 
 He will catch the vapors 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels 
 Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals 
 Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter 
 So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner 
 Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster 
 As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers 
 One shoe in the soupy gutter 
 One shoe in the velvet heaven 
 Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons 
 What's this 
 You could dance purty with the hooligan nation 
 Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift 
 Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit 
 We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit 
 Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood 
 Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped 
 I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini 
 Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery 
 What's this 
 Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport 
 Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court 
 They chase cheese fries with Binaca 
 They had shut the school down early 
 There were bombs inside the lockers 
 No concept of the problem 
 We responded like a snow day 
 It was clobber shit to flotsam 
 Til the cops said it was okay 
 Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes 
 Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors 
 And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often 
 Flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets 
 It was reign of the razor laser 
 Day of the cloudy howdy 
 Flight of the shelter melter 
 You can bow without me 
 What's this 
  
 [Refrain] 
  
 Watch me jump 
 What's this 
 Knock em out the box, Aes"This is labor" {*Echoes*} 
 {*Sample cut and scratched*} 
  
 Who put the monkey wrench in well-oiled perfectionist emblem 
 Just to watch these monitors spit white noise through your office space 
 Automater, I infect jolly gene pool descendant clown-clusters 
 Brushing dust mites off your starving art revolution sound jugglers 
 Delinquent friend from brick habitat 
 Bob, weave, stick, move, fence 
 And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention 
 This years brain crops spread spectacular, I ain't mad at ya 
 Don't stay mad at the caliber (I twist characters like Twist characters) 
 Tally up the alley cat aggression in this Doug E. Fresh infested 
 Mess of bass line lust and automatic b-boy Krylon can combust circuit 
 Working these war pig cyphers with Ted Striker stability 
 And kamikaze chivalry 
 I alone noble in a worm food feud 
 Walking dead generation 
 Ain't nobody asking for your patience 
 The grand opening holding me to face the fact 
 I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else 
 (Talk about labor) 
 Fantastic planet urchin putting work in 
 Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion 
 Apologies won't lure me to the communal sob story 
 Nor will I sacrifice live style to benefit jury temperament 
 This old Green Goblin web cutter butts up against 
 Crayola daydream landscape spitting bedlam. Dead 'em 
 Charge the villagers nickels and nicotine to watch him fed to 
 One disgruntled kraken at high noon 
 We'll sell popcorn beer and balloons 
 I got an inkling this gon' be the one the children bicker over 
 It's that Warriors vs. Baseball Fury element 
 To glitch his motor sensory development 
 I am a star, really 
 That Big Bang bastard's back with a one-way ticket to beat street 
 This all is like, relevant to human kind supply/demand ratios, man, learn it 
 I work past the surface 
 I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens 
 And I'll work until this here little flat line closes the curtains[Intro] 
 (Super fresh) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun 
 Troll of the treadmill 
 Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly) 
 Edgy from elevenses to Megabucks 
 Techies with the treble down 
 This is how we level up 
 Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease 
 As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys 
 The coping mechanism in his LMNOP's 
 Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves 
 Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries 
 Mulling over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify" 
 I'm at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe 
 Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones 
 "Hello, hello, hello, hello" 
 Base camp, space camp 
 Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance 
 Back in the back of the classroom 
 After a magical nap in a vacuum 
  
 [Hook] 
 Act natural, whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 (Superfresh) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die 
 Started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye 
 Putting on the yoga lady, cutting off The Cable Guy 
 Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize 
 AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched 
 Mentholated Tiger Balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap 
 Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask 
 Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast 
 40 winks, never the same adventure 
 Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever 
 In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort 
 No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher 
 Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness 
 It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist 
 The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death 
 Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 (Hey peace Aesop uh It's Chuck D 
 Yo man, you keep doin' what you're doin' man 
 Keep rhymin' through those walls, alright?) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body 
 From diary of dark to piety in the Ponzi 
 On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy 
 On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monte 
 Had to buy some clothes that fit me 
 And pretend I like agave 
 With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him 
 Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars 
 I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts 
 The piss-poor vision is 40 percent floaters 
 The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers 
 The friends you confessed all the dark shit to 
 Had weaponized the information before we could send roses 
 And they want a little pearl on how he got to where he at 
 I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap 
 Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes 
 Walk on even when the walls hug his coat 
  
 [Hook] 
 Act natural, whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 (Superfresh)[Verse 1] 
 Hey 
 Warm cider, barn full of spiders 
 Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters 
 In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire 
 Now add an organism from alternative environs 
 A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket 
 To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons 
 I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate 
 Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface 
 True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage 
 Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane 
 Go to where the radio trails off 
 And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox 
 Under a sideways rain cornering the briar 
 Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer 
 Nap in a hole in a tree 
 Cat leaving voles at my feet 
 Talking Master P, memory foam everything 
 Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory 
 Spinal Tap 11, tapping resin out the evergreen 
 Designated dark horse,  headless independently 
 Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs 
 Buried bones, and his very own blurry sasquatch vids 
 Led like field ants to a hot lens 
 8 o'clock kittens vs cobwebs, fight! 
  
 Maps won't work here 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Ice over bittersweet nightshade 
 Antlers rise from his migraine 
 Shred or die, life's strange 
 How do you identify? 
 New with the matutinal or peckish with the vespertine 
 Me, I'm pretty useless 
 Til the roof is painted Gemini, then set him free 
 Eat his own body weight in genocide 
 Came back a decorated dog of war 
 Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door 
 Additionally, dog isn't even his final form 
 Just a period, between greenhorn and Hyperion 
 Peer into the eye of a primordial experience 
 Portamento warriors in unforgiving wilderness 
 Borderline ethereal, Noah's Ark room tone 
 Add a little up high down low too slow 
 Found acquaintances a pain to babysit 
 So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip 
 Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows 
 Fish float belly up songbirds crash into windows 
 Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap 
 Suicide flies take dips in the kill zone 
 Still shuffle thru a stack of old photos 
 Taken before the varicose verified Chronos 
 I dunno it feels weird 
 I'd rather feed an apple to a deer 
  
 [Rob Sonic & Aesop Rock] 
 I might've heard something in the walls 
 Could've been voices 
 Could've been claws 
 Coulda been the rebel yell of something more evolved 
 Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like 
 "Wadup" 
  
 Ain't shit(Vita est morte est vita 
 Life is death is life) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Found nothing but the feathers and the skull 
 On the porch like a present with a bow 
 Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork 
 Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard 
 Epitaph and all 
 Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth 
 Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses 
 A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness 
 It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient 
 Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig? 
 The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee 
 When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie 
 And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle 
 One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work 
 Memitim ascending, settling any high scores 
 40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 (Impossible, impossible) 
  
 (Hold the fuck up 
 Who is you talking to? 
 Cause ain't nobody talking to you 
 You can't do a motherfucking thing) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon 
 Ripped the phone up out the wall 
 The po' would drag me from my bedroom 
 An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions 
 And the kind of doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum" 
 While explaining why you're selfish to romanticize a ruse 
 In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose 
 Any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo 
 Plus she'd make a beautiful widow 
 But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows 
 Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the 80s 
 When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety 
 But he didn't, it wasn't cause he doesn't get the message 
 More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is 
 On a scale you made up anyway 
 Half past out to pasture 
 Whether clapped or batteries in backwards 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 (Impossible, impossible) 
  
 (Check this shit out here 
 Don't be trying to come all for me 
 Cause you is not all of that with your fucked up haircut) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit 
 Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed 
 An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish 
 Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle 
 Unique until the spirit isn't willing 
 While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling 
 It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't 
 That's a reality you evade or grow to own 
 Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at 
 Black labs over wack dads on the admat 
 Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish 
 A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms 
 I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits 
 Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix 
 Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff 
 Somewhere in between the dust and dust 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 (Impossible, impossible)[Intro] 
 I stood before the glittery borders of new radius 
 In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet 
 What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment 
 Meets the lust for blood and demerits 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky 
 Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die 
 Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion 
 Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him 
 Worm teeth grinding feverishly below 
 As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow 
 So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk 
 They surface up through the cash crops 
 With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone 
 Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone 
 Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership 
 I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads 
 I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb 
 As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb 
 And that's unevenly rendered 
 To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason 
 But not a reason to surrender 
 Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog 
 Forty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon 
 Don and Vagabond alike repent 
 This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end 
  
 [Hook] 
 And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors 
 To murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before 
 They said 
 Kill television 
 Kill television 
 Kill television 
 Difficult isn't it 
 And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky 
 No love lost baby, the future is so bright 
 Kill television 
 Kill television 
 Kill television 
 Difficult isn't it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Nothing says charm like an armored car 
 Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar 
 We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts 
 And march through the gauntlet of car alarms 
 No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier 
 Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears 
 But we can run with scissors through the city fair 
 Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs 
 Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark 
 Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks 
 These are the vices of the p-noid bastards 
 Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest 
 But crews lose lunches by the hundreds 
 Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing 
 Humming keep your mouth closed 
 Keep your cows cloned, go 
 I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know 
 My what a convenient embargo 
 At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from 
 The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box 
 Fix, still in the pill in his sock 
 Chilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes 
 But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide 
 And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish 
 While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The mobile infantry is so postal 
 Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete 
 Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens 
 Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies 
 Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect 
 Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept 
 And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas 
 Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference 
 I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons 
 Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers 
 Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon 
 For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains 
 Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma 
 IMAX, city-wide transfer 
 Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement 
 Ease into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out 
 I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal 
 Monitor face to the wall opposite 
 U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song 
 While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 I am a man who uses the techniques of a bat to navigate... 
  
 [Verse] 
 Can’t motherfuck a motherfucker 
 From the underfunded Klutz who never undercut the butcher 
 The pick-a-booger-at-your-wake is bumping "I'm your pusher" 
 Also at your wake, Juvenile Intruders at the gate 
 Brooding over waking history that bubbles 
 From the blinking 12s of VCRs and Microwaves 
 Like time machines for shrinking elders 
 Rifling through their recipe, carrots, onions, celery 
 What unique amalgam of piss and repugnant energy 
 Spun him out of the 70s, to b-line for dessert? 
 Fire-eater trying to keep it on the green side of the dirt 
 This is tea-time with the worst 
 Geriatrics on the decline of berserk 
 Back in my day we were three times more alert 
 Now I go through my old clothing 
 Trying to find nostalgic threads to sell 
 Walk away feeling like I should have never dressed myself 
 Sincerely I was never on the cutting edge, my hand was on the hilt 
 You’re free to build with the other end 
 Shriek into the vacuum if in spite of your accomplishments 
 You wake up feeling empty like Houdini’s grave probably is 
 Volley with the quintessential digital ager, I'm offended by everything 
 My opinions come in a manger, oh boy 
 Depreciating since they drove me off the lot 
 Still into ghost stories and pot and the classic coconut bra 
 Procedural crime drama shows with holes in the plot 
 And reminding clones there’s more to coping 
 Than a nose full of snot 
 Ah, old pros throw 'bows to the 808 
 You couldn't throw a rope over a baby gate 
 Bishop to queen 4 in "Damn Daniel"s under ram skulls 
 Plan for cloudy with a chance of anvils 
 Fever dreams of padded cells and jagged pills in frozen pipes 
 Socialites from pageant hell with plastic smiles and robot eyes 
 I’m hoping you all grow into the sentience you assume 
 As your moment of self-reflection is a moment for me too 
 Look, with the steel chair, sure to serve the veal rare 
 Brush up your evasion and basic tactical field care 
 I was on that constant futile rage before the internet 
 I been ignored for longer than you’ve been interested 
 The posse promise you nobody feels threatened by a scarecrow covered in crows who feel welcomed 
 That’s like hellions thinking hell is just ok but needs some polish 
 It helps to know intimidation’s all about the optics 
 Come duck a bounty, it's a hoot, Suffolk County it's a zoo 
 Puppy chow and bitches brew, it's not exactly chicken soup 
 It’s heavy-lifters lifting, it’s ginseng on his whistling 
 It’s we don’t find the flippancy convincing, 2 for flinching 
 Older yeller, never knew a no-kill shelter in his doggie days 
 Now I draw my neighbors over Kouign-amanns and coffee stains 
 A walled and whirling urchin, more observant than audacious 
 I document the great unwashed and curse in Lithuanian 
 For a gallery of grifters channeling Sid’s action figures grafted 
 With his little sister’s aftermarket glue and scissors 
 It’s trippy, the truth and fiction moving to a center 
 Maybe it’s weirder they’ve never been photographed together 
 Sometimes the stomach disappears from under a retreating lens 
 And patterns of a need to please abusive folk reveal themselves 
 I’m peeling back the layers, I’m sneaking past the lasers 
 I’m a lover, I’m a fighter, I’m a seed to blackened acres 
 The dogs I think are following me home are out to kill me 
 Your music makes a motherfucker wanna move to Elm Street 
 Rejection of the spirit by the body at your service, if you mess-up every friendship come get swept up in the current 
 Here, wheels fall off of cars when they see him 
 Seas part, green trees march out of Eden 
 I'm known to eat the heart and keep the archery uneven 
 Are you starting to be part of the kinesis? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Got me on some other shit 
 Got me on some other shit 
 Got me on some other shit[Verse 1] 
 Dum-diggy, bump Biggie 
 Til the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie" 
 The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill 
 Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells 
 Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape 
 A single flower through the permafrost 
 Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants 
 War paint, circling a duralog 
 Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog 
 Schlock purist, watch the block burneth 
 One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins 
 The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis 
 Doggie bag doctors, military deserters 
 Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs 
 I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not 
 Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs 
 Might pedal by the police 
 Tuff with two F's 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Ah fuck that shit look 
 Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn 
 Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm" 
 The coke bottles tint film noir 
 Tripping out the milk bar 
 Poison horchata cup 
 Milf in the Zip Car 
 6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw 
 Part Def Jam part Dischord 
 My wig-picker threw me out of her office 
 Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome 
 Onion of 'bensis 
 Summer was awesome 
 Got brats on the grill 
 Wormwood in the cauldron 
 Horse hoof in the dog's mouth 
 Cholera in the well 
 Make money periodically vomiting on himself 
 I read Nat Geo, craft and crack geodes 
 Lift party hats out of Craft Depot 
 Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck 
 Came down from the mountain 
 Tuff with 2 F's 
  
 TUFF 
 TUFF 
  
 (What's so funny? 
 You, what are you laughing at? 
 I said what are you laughing at?) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Before a player ever met his omega 
 They were effectively reducing his behavior into data 
 With plans to build a dais where the 
 People grow potatoes and cabbage 
 Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas 
 In a spectacle displaying the nature of strange neighbors 
 I paint caves 'til the rage campaign tapers 
 And show a new crop how he used to moonwalk 
 Out of breath like a 7-day old balloon dog 
 I still hang band posters and buy black-lights 
 Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis 
 Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe 
 Nevermind the Ford-era christening and pants size 
 Man, who could've guessed the future of abominable imagery 
 Would also share a birthday with Kenny G? None 
 The 99 cent 2 cents keeps 2 arms folded 
 Tuff with 2 F's 
  
 Yeah, let's do it like that 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Unh I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers 
 And convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures 
 The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard 
 For the gone like Gossamer under number 3 clippers 
 Free, forged in various pulp channels 
 Even his prize horse rides a wolf into battle 
 Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up 
 Or his name off the paper 
 It's Aes pronounced "Why Us?!" 
 First learned the high art of eyeing a mark 
 Buying nickels for a dime at the park 
 I learn to rhyme in New York 
 I learned to breathe underwater 
 I learned to walk with a ghost 
 Adidas reeking of sulfur 
 A chauffeur cemetery funk 
 When home is a bleeding ulcer 
 Everything you ever stood up for is keeling over 
 Moonset beautifying 
 Cartoon death catfish on the Foreman 
 Tuff with 2 F's 
 Yeah[Verse 1] 
 Die already 
 None defy the one-man walled city 
 Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands 
 88 stance draped in invasive plants 
 And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell 
 Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell 
 Pours hot tar from the top of the barn 
 Necktie on his head, condor on his arm 
 Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable 
 Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult 
 Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling 
 Either way his ID show a snake and skull 
 Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally 
 Of which lies he told who 
 Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl 
 Soon enough I will estrange you all 
 I get ghost 
  
 [Ghossssst] 
 [Now the beat goes!] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 On Dasher 
 Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar 
 Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville 
 Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal 
 Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and 
 Carnivourous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms 
 I dunno I gotta think about it 
 Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward 
 Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents 
 Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist 
 Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy 
 Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate 
 Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree 
 And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway 
 Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones 
 Just know when the room go cold 
 I'm a ghost 
  
 [Ghossssst] 
  
 G-H-O-S-T 
 Ghost ghost ghost 
 He's ghost 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Flea comb, exorcism and de-worming 
 Fitted for a curse and a crown of birds circling 
 Search party falling forward unthwarted 
 Meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered 
 For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards 
 Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper 
 And a runneth over cup full of black tap water 
 Its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter 
 Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast 
 And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes 
 With no immediately measurable crimewave ice-age 
 Christ children still skin a cat sideways 
 I don't pick teams or administer bans 
 I'm in the creek with a pick and a pan, it go 
 Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene 
 Tell 'em what the out-of-order blinking EMF mean 
 Ghost 
  
 [Ghossssst]Don't fool with his cool 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I turn a staff to a snake and back, evade crack 
 Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache 
 Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill 
 Tabletop frames on dutch tilt, crush kill 
 Maker bot coin-op arcade punk 
 Talkin’ arcane science, dark age pulp 
 Four eyes carb face, Bar-Kays iron on 
 Pork rinds orangeade, Jarred brains die alone 
 No Mulligans, crow bars bird cage 
 Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day 
 And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor 
 Messenger, better yet a vessel for a Tetris score 
 Zilch, cowabunga homies call me “press ignore” 
 Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil 
 Farm baited breath and tempermental tremors 
 That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers 
 And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken 
 For the footage, I’m off cam dynamite fishin’ 
 For diamondback rattles in his holy grail 
 Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal 
 3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock 
 Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra 
 Buh-dum-bum, follow the regenerated rebel flesh 
 Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetrafish 
 Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore 
 Before we are the severed heads of civil war 
 Invasive radio ricochet off the silver foil 
 Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil 
 Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks 
 I know, this is why we can’t have nice things 
 I prefer to skip the pleasantries 
 Flip the diner table, dip in time for final jeopardy 
  
 No shit 
 Oh and don’t fool with his cool 
 Ma, can we get a pool? 
 … Is that a no? 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces 
 Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses 
 Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping 
 Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping 
 Slow Mozart, no I’ve never heard of knocking 
 Might’ve burst in on it, splits or skin popping 
 Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day 
 Locate and aim for the token propane tank 
 Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair 
 To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear 
 It spun a human resources issue to public affair 
 Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear 
 And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lip and grudge are crippling 
 The wonder twins of bitching 
 Armchair hater, I wouldn’t piss on your coffin 
 But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it 
 The Ozone breakaway tux 
 Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts 
 Pipe cleaner mustache, rope hands google eyes 
 Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize 
 You are now rockin’ with the worst 
 Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems 
 Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees 
 Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds 
 Jeez, forgive him any dicey past 
 He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp 
 And he don't get out much, but when he do it's Beatlemania 
 Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius 
 Too charitable, offerin’ the average joe some real estate 
 Between the Big Mouth Billy Bass and jackalope 
 Cozy in a moment of bliss 
 Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge 
 No shit[Intro] 
 Grows back 
 Dude, it grows back 
 It's ok it grows back 
 Ma! 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 There is a bowl cut template mapped with a billy can 
 Mega mom scissoring a topiary lego man 
 Mini-ramp cowlick 
 Good ship snot nose 
 Lap rain water out of pigeon hill potholes 
 Rat brain, shovel green peas offa butterknife 
 Racoon hat, moon boots all summer-type 
 Felt pressure at the center of the dog show 
 Better off blending, sweater—off Waldo 
 You! Wanna see a genome mutate? 
 Cut a page boy ‘til it bring home a Cube tape 
 Poof, screw-face wriggle out a chop shop 
 Home-brewed Kool-aid, Disavowing Osh Kosh 
 Simulating television 
 Little rowdy rock snob 
 Bobble-headed shredder playing top-heavy hop scotch 
 You realize you only got a week 
 ‘til you catch him with a set of shitty clippers in the sink 
 Like bzzzzt, motherfucking bzzzzt, bzzzzt 
 That's a quiet kid, buzzing asymmetric rebel lines in 
 Crudely, some say to praise the lord 
 I say you wanna feel saved baby shape the orb 
 And I will see you all in Helven 
 Read he fled a panic room pissed 
 And been searching for animal chin since 
 Bumpin' Johnny Rad, eye on the sauce pan 
 Current mop: 4 months shy on the off-chance 
 Might just reset this whole shit 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Start with a text book bowl cut (Bowl cut!) 
 One you can mow down slow as you grow up 
 Learn a couple great new curse words (Pussy!) 
 Buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn 
  
 [Interlude] 
 “Haircuts! Get your five dollar haircut here! I can do mohawks, fauxhauks, afros, halfros, racing stripes, fringes, high top fades, mullets, reverse mullets, crew cuts and much much more!" 
  
 "No, I just needed a little off the top" 
  
 "Mirror? No, you can’t look in a mirror, trust me, you look awesome!" 
  
 "I just want to take a look" 
  
 "Give me another buck and I'll trim [?]" 
  
  
 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 I knew this kid Camu who in the lion's mouth 
 Made up a fail safe way to get his life corralled 
 Let's say he short on the rent 
 His land lord is upset 
 He disappears with sheers yelling "I'm going George Jeff" 
 Bathroom door sound like a part—mech barbershop quartet 
 Forced into war with itself 
 What emerge next in a shaft of light is bald up top 
 Long on the back and sides 
 Maybe the blade oil came with a ax to grind 
 But granddaddy half-smile, all mastermind 
 He asked, "How do I look?" 
 I said, "You look insane" 
 He said the haircut come with a theory, I'll explain 
 Please do 
 First: no hats allowed 
 Faux nat' male pattern when he out the house 
 And wouldn't crop it up until his monopoly prop pass go 
 ‘til then walk this town like an asshole 
 Bzzzt! Motherfucking bzzzt bzzzt! 
 Last week we were stoney 
 This week he program beats all Monday, sold two Wednesday 
 Pay rent, fabricate a whole new hedge maze 
 Back on his smooth shit Friday at noon bitch 
 Wow, just like that 
 A method I encourage you to share and apply and adapt 
 As one day his didn't grow back 
 So, if yours does, get that zig zig zag 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Start with a text book bowl cut (Afro!) 
 One you can mow down slow as you grow up 
 Learn a couple great new curse words (Fuckface!) 
 Maybe try a pony hawk, take 2, your turn[Verse 1] 
 The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season 
 I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting 
 And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November 
 Had only brushed the blossom bracket 
 Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit 
 I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses 
 With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses 
 But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass 
 Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous 
 And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers 
 When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres? 
 Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil 
 By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels 
 The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors 
 And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors 
 Puts it down 
 It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs 
 Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on 
 Nova 
 The elders took positions and the fans marched 
 Parched, plain and steamed 
 Hawking the rain in my canteen 
 Now I'm like point: 
 I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads 
 Counterpoint: 
 During my famine I never got broke your bread 
 Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes 
 Lemme fence sit for a bit 
 These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens 
 Shut the fuck up 
 Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt 
 Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth 
 It hurts 
  
 [Hook] 
 Must not sleep. Must warn others 
 Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers 
 I milk my habitat for almost everything I want 
 Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut 
 Must not sleep. Must warn others 
 Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers 
 I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine 
 But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Crowning the glory of our advance 
 Fire ants to water beetles 
 These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles 
 Pupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream 
 Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine 
 Check it 
 I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time 
 Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline 
 It's a metaphor for nighttime 
 Anti-up the slight cost of exhaustion 
 To salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent 
 Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul 
 (You should know!) 
 Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit 
 Lick my knuckles clean 
 Noting the corporate clusters holding hands 
 'round the abode of the damned 
 Now what's your poison? 
 Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser 
 Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later: 
 The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges 
 20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by 
 Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline 
 With no free time. The alarm storms at nine 
 My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir 
 Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir? 
 Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.' 
 I breathe slow 
 I run in with these fantastic amalgams 
 Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums 
 Security's the javelin, catch it 
 Labor 
 Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since 
  
 [Hook] 
 Must not sleep. Must warn others 
 Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers 
 I milk my habitat for almost everything I want 
 Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut 
 Must not sleep. Must warn others 
 Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers 
 I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine 
 But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning 
  
 [Outro] 
 Feel it, it's like thatHere we go, happy holidays 
  
 July 4th, 1981, candles of a Roman ilk 
 Unloaded from a chevy truck Into the home her folks had built 
 Patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs 
 Safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares 
 Couple cousins, uncles, aunts, mostly grown-ups, couple brats 
 Baby Ruby's only two She's too close to the jumping jacks 
 Mommy scoops her to the house/Buckles up the booster seat 
 Rolls her to the storm door 
 Let her long for all the lunacy 
 Telephone distracting Mom/Ruby wriggles out her strap 
 Fingers push the plexi-glass/She's off into the sour patch 
 Past the pyrotechnics undetected and invisible 
 Woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool 
 Off into the yawning blue/The splash would mum the rocket-ships 
 Ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant 
 Many sprung and sprinted down All arrive belated but 
 The beast she had earlier bestirred had been alert since waking up 
 Canine let his gainer fly/Water top commotion grow 
 Howling guests assumed the cloven hooves had come to do-si-do 
 Frenzied and congested deck Part to let the elders see 
 Soggy beagle gently dragging Ruby in his yellow teeth 
 Laid the tiny body in the sun before her Father‘s feet 
 When she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee 
 Healthy air had reconvenedTowel his shaking Ruby off 
 EMT confirm the save,Everybody say "Good dog!"[Verse 1] 
 At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head 
 Consider an irregular character sketch 
 Food hoarder, communes with the flora 
 Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force 
 I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus 
 Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks 
 Never mind time on the short bus 
 Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport 
 Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas 
 Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs 
 Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs 
 He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait) 
 Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait) 
 Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through 
 Try aisle nine by the cat food 
 There it is 
 Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills" 
 Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day 
 Check, check, check 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Catch 'em on the lam 
 (I ain't joking) 
 No maps, no muster point 
 (Nah, I ain't joking) 
 I put a pebble on a tomb 
 (I ain't joking) 
 Making bath tub meth 
 I'm joking 
 Here we go 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The whip got a tongue and teeth 
 Too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a Tungsten bleep 
 When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach 
 I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think 
 And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island 
 Stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science 
 Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds 
 Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us 
 Back at the battering ram post-haste 
 Cro-mags, wait till this Saturday plans grow legs 
 All you hear is intermittent code names 
 Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space 
 Unfrozen part of his new J.O 
 Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao 
 Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring 
 I was in the dark, dodging and burning 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 Maybe cause I look like an ugly doll 
 (I ain't joking) 
 Pack a wallop in the wheelhouse 
 (Nah, I ain't joking) 
 Leave brass tacks everywhere 
 (I ain't joking) 
 I own many many homes 
 I'm joking 
 Here we go 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 All hock-tooie no costume 
 Black hoodie you can set your watch to 
 Tall drink, daps like an air raid 
 Radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain 
 Down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links 
 Upperway, upper-case tri-state style kings 
 Get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves 
 Lights off, spine on sideways 
 Riding down the block, scooping Bobby in a boogie-down 
 Tony told me tell 'em "Hello, 7:30 noodle-town" 
 Cool 'em down, global domination over salt bake 
 Situation comedy in broke dude cosplay 
 You don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows 
 The summary is as follows: 
 "These hate those and this thinks, that's absurd" 
 Yip yap, y'all cats and birds 
  
 [Hook 3] 
 Meow meow meow meow meow 
 (I ain't joking) 
 Talking rubes on the radio 
 (Nah, I ain't joking) 
 Uh, suckers never play me 
 (I ain't joking) 
 I found Jimmy Hoffa's body 
 I'm joking 
 Here we go[Sample] 
 This is my friend Tony 
 He's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart 
  
 [Intro] 
 And then they were eight 
 Just like that, just like that...

 (Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent 
 Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently 
 The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house 
 And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out 
 Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma clouds 
 Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids 
 Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy 
 Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies 
 Idle when soldering a perfect union 
 It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends 
 So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance 
 The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps 
 Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss 
 Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives 
 I show up late looking project grizzly 
 Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed 
 Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut 
 What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks? 
 I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood 
 But if I'm not! 
 Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back 
 Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack 
 And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia 
 Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation 
 And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt 
 Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma 
 The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal 
 Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you 
  
 [Hook] 
 All I thought of was the cloven-hooved 
 And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs 
 With a nose for commotion and stolen goods 
 Now tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do? 
 In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight) 
 In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight) 
 In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight) 
 We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate 
  
 [Interlude] 
 (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) 
 (Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto) 
 (Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto) 
 They're all-they're gonna want his milk money next 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow 
 Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone 
 All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home 
 Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong 
 Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle 
 Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule 
 And you can hear the iron maidens lock 
 Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck 
 A is up early, ring and run thank you much 
 Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck 
 Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip 
 Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like 
 Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill 
 This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still 
 This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build 
 Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell 
 Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers 
 Tugboat salvage all fossils 
 I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors 
 If I'm not, fuck it 
 The terrible metal hacking seasons's as American as ski up off a plastic d-cup 
 You'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen 
 How I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts 
 In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding sits the morals 
 Every outing would slide to refine his grinding 
 When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you 
 You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose

 Bright lights, bright lights 
  
 I wear shoes to bed 
 Paint teeth on my lips 
 Trench foot, gangrened for the win 
 Blitzkrieg Bopper 
 Petitioned out of shit's creek proper 
 The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler 
 Screaming ‘uncle’ in a sea of TV doctors 
 Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce 
 The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing 
 Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee 
 More to follow, outside tweakers are in love 
 Teeny Raque Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers 
 Poisoned or maybe just a misfit toy or two 
 Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose 
 That sorta hemming and hawing‘ll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally 
 And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy 
 Everything his cutting room scrapped 
 On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack! 
  
 All these tribes hoard breads and wines 
 These climates transform men to swine 
 (AGAIN!) 
 All these hives hide knives and lead 
 These bribes can't transform swine to men 
  
 Sensible sweater on ice 
 Devil horns high 
 Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes 
 Vendetta-drunk leader squealing 
 "it's the real pig fever" 
 Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers 
 That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers 
 Look at mommy's little Hercules 
 Custom Troy Hurtubise 
 Flourish in the blind spot of Spittle County 'Gore Police' 
 Or really any readily ebbing and flowing 'War and Peace' 
 1 plain brown key foods bag head 
 2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread 
 Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost 
 The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm 
 It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs 
 They seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed 
 See my ‘Goodnight Irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy 
 Whole diner like "i'll have what he's having" 
  
 All these tribes hoard breads and wines 
 These climates transform men to swine 
 (AGAIN!) 
 All these hives hide knives and lead 
 These bribes can't transform swine to men 
  
 Aggravated brain stick, motion sick 
 They peel back slow and expose the whole shit 
 Brain set drum speed to ultimate 
 Break bones in the throws of moments so ill 
  
 Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier 
 They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years 
 Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns 
 Truthfully a whole community of scientists are baffled 
 In '89 maybe 10 showed up at the wharf 
 As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort 
 Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton 
 Like a half-ton annoyance ‘til the heart-warming story went public 
 You'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves 
 A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove 
 Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove 
 I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go 
 Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty 
 If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy 
 Every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic 
 Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit 
  
 All these tribes hoard breads and wines 
 These climates transform men to swine 
 (AGAIN!) 
 All these hives hide knives and lead 
 These bribes can't transform swine to men[Verse 1] 
 Ian why don't you say grace 
 "dear god thanks, and if you loved me vegetables would be extinct" 
 Now I'm looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined 
 Rectangle seat 4, squeeze 5 
 Each one may not be excused from the table ‘til the green gone 
 Stomach revvin‘ up an episodic rerun 
 Where's a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one? 
 Chris and Graham hate ‘em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp! 
 Moments later 2 have been released 
 Leaving me the legroom and the legume police 
 Going "freeze, you with the pretzeled arms 
 Send your fabricated nausea my best regards 
 And know this kitchen as a prison ‘til the pea pods die 
 I could sit here all night" 
 So could I 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 Who was at the door just now? 
 Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides Really? 
 Yup I told em "oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Blink Twice if you are being held hostage 
 I speak and spell of a sleeper cell in the hospice 
 Woke, impersonating busy little helpers 
 That intimately purr between the hiccuping up of feathers 
 Pick a porcelain dish 
 A single portion canned 
 Frozen or fresh 
 Defies the glory of the Poultry or fish 
 Via communal bloodletting that rupture the spud levy 
 No '87 supper-scape was truly flood-friendly, ever 
 Including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never 
 Where room temp heirlooms emanate a crude black mist 
 To a rendition of "dude, dad's pissed" 
 Tell dad dude's pissed too 
 Not to mention genuinely brandishing a the new gill hue 
 Still out-mule any last strafing watchmen 
 ‘Til the lord taketh waiting as an option

 Yup, I told em "oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Less like toes in a tide pool 
 More like, left, right, poached from notable giant Kaiju 
 Fat neck, fine tooth, rock and lean, yelling 
 "This ends now eat the god damn beans!" Ah! 
 Hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that there's flatware exhumed by a crane arm 
 Time for some action 
 Stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction 
 Brined in malpractice 
 Carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access 
 If only in compliance with a deep-fried fascist, peep 
 Literally bite down once 
 And my tongue get a flooding from my uninvited guts 
 Pointer finger plug a hole in the dam 
 Ma notice, "ok gross, blowfish, dinner's over, go spit", pop call "bullshit" 
 Both of my brothers break in, like "he's on his Davie Hogan no mistakin'", by the way

 Yo change the fucking channel 
 I burn a Coma candle 
 When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample 
 We them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap 
 Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep 
 And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers 
 Training Generation Fallout 
 Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out 
 There's smoke in my iris 
 But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids 
 So I'm ready now (What you ready for?) 
 I'm ready for life in this city 
 And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me 
 I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass 
 Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles 
 Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals 
 Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool 
 (This is our school) 
 I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool 
 Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool 
 (Man please) Man please 
 My name stands for my being 
 And my being stands for the woman who stood 
 And braved the storm to raise the seedling 
 (Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful) 
 Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence 
 Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish 
 But missers miss, I slept through my appointment 
 Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify 
 And picked the rose that wilted 
 The second I introduced myself as Nervous 
 Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken 
 Some are burning, some have frozen 
 Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them 
 Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion 
 Mine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion 
 Now where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate 
 He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make 
 Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show 
 Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this 
  
 *Horn samples* 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 And I ain't getting any younger 
 My knuckles wear their bruises well 
 I've yet to lose that hunger 
 But only time can tell 
 Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch 
 And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks 
 See your name is Ambiguity 
 My name is something hands can't hold 
 But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold 
 It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick 
 Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now 
 And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest 
 But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock 
 Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing 
 The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds 
 To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel 
 Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn 
 But y'all numb from gut fuel 
 I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor 
 Cuz a martyr-made motor don't quit 
 I am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal 
 Channel surfing my way to the top 
 Tugboat in a bottle 
 With no holes poked in the nozzle 
 I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight 
 Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile 
 And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median 
 The second my halo ran outta helium 
 Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull 
 I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry 
 But my energy's a rental 
 So I take this now to say 
 Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick 
 Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego 
 Y'all are family for life 
 I'll take that bullet to preserve you 
 I wanna be something spectacular 
 On the day the sun runs outta batteries 
 Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy 
 Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn 
 Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this 
 (I ain't gettin' any younger) 
  
 *Horn samples to end*[Hook] 
 Get up to get down now 
 Get up to get down now (like this) 
 Get up to get down now (like this) 
 Get up to get down now (alright) 
 I don't wanna do it anymore 
 Couldn't do it if I tried, wouldn't do it if I wanted it 
  
 Hey 
 I don't wanna do it anymore 
 Couldn't do it if I tried... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Okay, the moments were subtle, but unstolen, and guess who owns them? 
 No friendly, non-threatening corporate, lacky-mucks, in the totem 
 Lucy was In the Sky with Diamonds,five dollars to hold 'em 
 The summer, Van Eek beat Pac-Man, with acid behind his molars 
 Little white tab tolerant, little white flag, waggling 
 Inorganic, pat on back, trim the panic, flat on backer 
 Back to back like Mad Hatter magic, rabid mastiff collaborative  - Splatter,bachelor fabric fatter, with cabbage patch lit 
 Dark days, Ben and Louie-Louie, park blazed, chemically - 
 Bent-up but eager to crash for that one, two, three repeater 
 Good Morning Vietnam!Whose couch is this? Whose house is this? 
 Who are you down with bitch?I'm sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit 
 There was this rabid foot talisman, drowning out of my armspan 
 What's fouler, was the other farmhand's growing gills, and shark fangs 
 What's fouler, was my torso stripped to ribbons, in the marshlands 
 But I'm up now 
 Let's get this window pane, and shut the fuck down 
 Down by the river, where the litter sits - 
 And lion-heart critters, smoke dope, and act like illiterates 
 I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts, and high social maladjust-ees 
 Sacred, numb and boundless went to St. Protocol, cut me, well - 
 I was dummy to some, when the tongue was cradled, and my skin looks crazy 
 Pocketbook mirror courtesy Amy,spiders in the  -Mattress,paisley sunglasses, dilated eyes green 
 Ice grill that could burn through, your picture-in-picture widescreen 
 Poison late late show, starring Aes' and in a jigsaw face of - 
 Twelve hour, solid gold entertainment, utter shit to self - 
 From mothership to stealth,they DD pace be, Space Invader 
 This one's for the Labor Days, work for rent and rolling papers 
 Only the illest beats leak absurdly out the boombox 
 The Daytripper anthem goes: wake, drop, walk to aquarium 
 Whistle while you work, like a canary lung,"All work -And no play makes Jack a dull boy", to carry drugs 
 I sorta see it, as my last blast in summer (Uhn!) 
 Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers 
 Good times, good people,all airbrushed - 
 On a collapsible easel, peace man, easy 
  
 [Bridge] 
 And I knew the permanancy would drift 
 And I knew the pH balance wasn't right 
 And I knew the crash and burn, how to caress it 
 L.S.D. flashed the message 
 And I knew the gash wasn't gonna stop bleeding 
 And I knew the ph balance wasn't right 
 And I knew how September would then affect it 
 L.S.D 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Lazy summer days 
 Like some decrepit landshark dumb luck squad dog lurks sicker deluded 
 Last sturdy domino lean's secluded 
 Don't let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students 
 Dragnet lifer solutions 
 Daddy loved sloppy dimensions like son-daughter links 
 Such determinated lepers, successfully disheveled 
 Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking 
 Lemmings 
 Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses 
 Some do 
 Let sleeping dogs lie still 
 Don't look so damn lackluster 
 Suck defeat 
 Lump summed damage 
 Load sample, delete 
 Late Show Dave Letterman, shitty diner lip-slide dutch 
 Low self-discipline leaders see dead lung self-destruct 
 Life sucks dickhead 
 Lost summers display laminate showcasing divinity live 
 System definitive 
 Liturgy soaked, depict lowly spectactular delight 
 Why, what kind of L.S.D. you like? 
 Your lizard king has spoken (all hail) 
 You in the back of the muck, those trails aren't necessarily bunk 
 (Summertime) 
 Some'll try and recapture the same flag 
 But I played it smart and recognized the summertime passed 
  
 [Hook][Aesop Rock] 
 Take-take the medicine, tastes great 
 Got the key to the city, I’m wake-baked 
 Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint 
 The origin of a thievery leader will take place 
 Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler 
 Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer 
 And no role model provoke him to shift focus 
 Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen 
 Kids got the darnedest quirks 
 So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse 
 And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn 
 Which he kept in a box in the yard 
 And the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem 
 But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas 
 Dance to the dirge, stand up 
 Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned 
 See it rolls off the tongue 
 Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done 
 Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it 
 Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit 
 "Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!" 
 Did you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem? 
 Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom 
 Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens? 
 Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school 
 On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule 
 Every last number in its history 
 Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory 
 Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest 
 Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds 
 Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate 
 Get your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest 
  
 Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm 
 Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you... 
 (Capture the flag) 
 (Capture the flag) 
 (Capture the flag) 
  
 One by one like little confused penguins 
 Larceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons 
 Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat 
 Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing 
 Nope, gotta configure the five finger 
 So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable 
 If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed 
 I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like 
 Step on the abysmal cusp 
 With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck 
 Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch 
 Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums 
 And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery 
 Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click! 
 Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery 
 In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed 
 Skip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer 
 Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king 
 And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me 
 It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed 
 The seed's all growns up playing grown people games 
 Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase 
 Grip, mitigate the master plan 
 So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands 
 Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock 
 So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch 
 I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked 
 Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop 
 Capture the flag, drag that crass little bastard 
 Flat through the hazmat and glass 
 Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that: 
 Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash 
  
 Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm 
 Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you 
 And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...

 "Chill with that ill behavior!" 
 "Chill with that ill, ill behavior!" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb 
 Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mix 
 Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler 
 It's bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture 
 I branch out, arms flailing backwards 
 Whaling upon a tidy sound circuit, slightly foul Gershwin 
 With a bed of nails and drum lust, plus disgusting service 
 Working in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace 
 I be the now observatory: eye, ear, antenna feeler 
 Spitting like a dragon with a similar demeanor 
 Stood innocent bystand, witness the die-hard fans turn Rip Van 
 In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet 
 Now I'm thinking, "Who am I?" Jabberwocky Superfly, bent left 
 Pushing war without the ten step cushion, and what? (What?) 
 I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins 
 Until the day I die from grimace overload 
 It's shock (It's shock) 
 Treatment offered by the weekend 
 Dystopia getaway, let's display the sequence, it goes: 
 One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless 
 And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (Under the carpet) 
 I drag a yellow taxi meter 
 Behind every measure and charge cats for labeling me shepherd 
 "That'll be 6.50 plus tip, darling 
 I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons" 
 Got caught up in the universe trying to zoom in on stardom 
 Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon 
 Next time you wanna be a hero, try saving something other than hip-hop 
 And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop 
 Kill 'em all, yield 
 (Naw, man, it wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield, brother 
 I just read and pulled the trigger) 
 Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates 
 Capture the halo, jet back to base, step 
 Fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers 
 There ain't nothing broken, where you at? 
 The pistons pump perfect, where you at? 
 The bass tone is Merlin, where you at? 
 The services of urgent working surgeons 
 Purging formulas looking for an improper cause is whack 
  
 [Hook] (x2) 
 What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, honestly) 
 What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, no honestly) 
 What are you saving, honestly? (Damn) 
 Promise me you gon' shut the fuck up and recognize 
 What you holdin ain't really broken 
  
 [Interlude] 
 I don't flick needles like my sick friend 
 I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend 
 I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend 
 And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen 
 All I ever really wanted was a getaway 
 I'mma take a chance by letting a rook slide forward out of my hands 
 I cannot agree to follow a leader along a borderline 
 Of war without a reason for the "ready, aim, score." 
 Bring out your dead, we can put 'em in a pile 
 And burn 'em with the novels for the kiddies to admire 
 Kill the ones that speak from a different life brew? 
 I'd rather kill the noisemaker that separated the two 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit 
 Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender 
 Oh, yeah, I'll let God warm the bench for now 
 But I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy 
 (And for the record I'm bringing my TV with me) 
 It goes: let the commoners speak publicly 
 Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil 
 But can't see past the loophole 
 Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets 
 With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise 
 (Let 'em grow leisurely) 
 Hey Mom, I'mma fix whatever I broke along this path 
 Once my spiel's perfected, I'mma save you a seat in the front row 
 Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar 
 And when all these bickering crowds turn silent you gon' be proud 
 I tack hacks to the (backboard) 
 Honesty's a (patchcord) 
 Fury's far from (obsolete) 
 Serenity's a (crack whore) 
 Raw caricature of mayhem standard, branded by the labor 
 With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors 
 Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage 
 Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged 
 Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to 
 Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider picking up your record 
  
 [Hook] (x2)

 The Orphanage, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 The Overground, man they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Def Jux, they ain't got nothin' to save

 Weightless, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Stronghold, man, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Rhymesayers, baby, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Aesop Rock, I ain't got nothin' to save 
 It's like that...[Hook] 
 Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat 
 Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 New Salem 
 Brave new voodoo 
 Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo 
 I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches 
 The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes 
 Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen 
 The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions 
 In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days 
 That chewed his plumage to the root 
 And proved a prequel to malaise 
 A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face 
 He'd been replaying the scenario for days 
 With the variables replaced 
 Meh 
 Loser in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining 
 Part riot, part Orion 
 We jarred a lot of lightning up 
 Shook a turkey leg or 10 
 Maybe we deserve a day of rest 
 Not to mention... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat 
 Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 1 AM defend the whole block 
 (1 A M) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes 
 Open and moving like a luchador with no eyeholes 
 Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft 
 Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up 
 Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch 
 Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash 
 Less Jarts more Rummikub 
 Whatever keep the scallywags wrapped up in the subterfuge 
 Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures 
 I could drive into a lake of fire 
 Pay the piper COD 
 Aware the pot and kettle shop a little toxin equally at least 
 It's probably more the kid than the kid 
 Either way a vital widget in the system is sick 
 A sea of symptoms in the hinges hit the room all at once 
 All I can do is plug the roof with my gum 
 For now I gotta... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass 
 Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash" 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 1 AM defend the whole block 
 (1 A M) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex 
 Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus 
 Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes 
 No compost, bird seed out of feeders 
 Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether 
 Keep a hand on the pepper spray 
 Sneakers on the detour 
 They're more scared of you than you them 
 Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has 2 chins 
 Leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills 
 Guilty in the window romanticizing the potters field 
 Not sorry, but I never really was a leader 
 Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza 
 You meet a few exceedingly forsaken 
 Sit around the cooler refusing domestication 
 Then a couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running 1 AM 
 By the way... 
  
 [Hook] 
 A third party, who was incidentally not Alex 
 Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 1 AM defend the whole block(That's impossible) 
  
 (Come on) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Spoilers, the non bon-voyage 
 Stock weaponry and soylents and whatever stop the voices 
 Colossal paranoias out to author an abrasive lore 
 About how war paint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby 
 No ground wires, all jaw froth 
 Mouth-breathing outliers climb out of mothballs 
 Wrung stones unsung and alone 
 Known to run up in the unknown, "honey I'm home" 
 I push a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake 
 I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake 
 Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away 
 'Til then he's documenting cops and watching Heaven decay 
 It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation braced accordingly 
 Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine 
 Yes y'all the crestfallen careworn 
 Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn 
  
 [Chorus 1] 
 These awful winds 
 Those grinding gears 
 This pile of bones 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
  
 These violent drums 
 Those primal fears 
 This pool of mud 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w-wild frontier 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 That's impossible, body still warm 
 Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules 
 I'm catatonic, fat, and outta rocket-fuel and ramen 
 Not a dollar, watching Rocky 2 in Donatello boxers 
 At some hot-as-hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri-La 
 More akin to angry mobs with anchor tats and mangey dogs in vacant lots 
 Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds 
 Not even a baby doll to change his gauze 
 Not even a hideaway to hide up in 
 A side effect of sliding environment to environment 
 Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again 
 Departures and arrivals aren't only time and mileage 
 Try again again, a raider break off from the phalanx 
 And never look back, never cook crack, K - thanks, bye 
 New York in the rear view then peel 
 Out, 'til he found New York in the windshield 
  
 [Chorus 2] 
 These cursed dogs 
 Those flying spears 
 This rancid food 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
  
 These fleeting hopes 
 Those vital prayers 
 This bag of cash 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w-wild frontier 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This was never an effective way to rally insurgents 
 Or really even the occupation of a rational person 
 When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in 
 You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement 
 In a jiffy, just eat your food and keep the future iffy 
 That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity 
 Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection 
 God forbid he try to live or gain momentum 
 Mend or pay his penance 
 You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps 
 Surf a thousand couches 
 Take a jagged little down the hatch 
 Chowderheads 
 I know you love the way the failure flounder 
 Maybe I could be your daily downer 
 If his brain left his body and was headed for the door 
 Would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar? 
 No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze 
 We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades 
  
 [Chorus 3] 
 These churning seas 
 Those quiet sneers 
 This box of parts 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
  
 These creepy friends 
 Those dicey dares 
 This perfect dark 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w wild frontier[Intro] 
 We're so excited, we don't know what to do 
 Because we're about to reenter the level above humans 
  
 I couldn't have had a better life than I've had in since 21 years 
 And if it was good here, I know it is going to be good-twice as good when I get up there 
  
 This isn't a troubling circumstance, don't take it as that-it is just a gateway, just a drawing 
  
 W-What we're doing is we're going home. We're going home to those individuals who sent us here to do this task, and this is the happiest and joyous thing that you can- 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Alright 
 Raised on dirty hot dog water and popcorn butter 
 EPMD tellin' me every popstar a sucker 
 Don't let him smell the potstickers, he'll stick around for supper 
 He'll stick around for cheesecake, then three days, then the summer 
 Where spiders eat their mothers, where rodents eat their young 
 I'm not here to make sense where there is none, that's dumb 
 My attitude is ghastly, any gallantry been going gone 
 I think I'm probably a lot like dating Mola Ram, I should work on that 
 The geezer not a leader, I'm a loner 
 Lover, believer, upholder of the under 
 Just not a people person, please forgive me if I'm flustered 
 I'll save a thousand whales before your grits are even buttered 
 My name is Aesop Rock, I've been a mess for my entire life 
 All I know is fight or flight, what the fuck's a silent night? 
 Who the fuck are you to tell me who the fuck you even are 
 This is more than band-aids over itsy-bitsy bleeding hearts 
 This is GNR announcing Jesus Christ on lead guitar 
 Finding Heather Hunter still inside your college VCR 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, I feel like a fucking dog 
 Something this depraved is not a product of a loving God 
 Periwinkle Pegasus through rat-infested LEGO bricks 
 Hug his mother briefly, then we're off to see the exorcist 
 I will not be checking messages 
 Why, should I be? 
  
 Special is as special does, you aren't special just because 
 Yes your mother said you was, that's pretty much what mothers does 
 Someday I might find the pluck to roam the Earth with zero strings 
 Cut the tether float this feather over eastern seaboard winds forever 
 Like seaboard kings invested in the the froth and fog 
 They'll talk of his adventuring and call him things like "salty dog" 
 He freed like a bajillion prisoners from some secret haunted vault 
 Always had a L to puff, never yelled "Get off my lawn!" 
 Full disclosure I don't even have a lawn 
 If I did I'd probably grow the grass until the house was gone 
 Kick it ‘til the town forget the address or the house at all 
 This is how performance art exacerbates an albatross 
 I should maybe shake some hands 
 I should turn the music down 
 Have some people over without asking them to move a couch 
 But, since you're here I've got this awful futon I could do without 
 Should take like two seconds...Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles 
 Thousands of them line the pavement 
 Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

 (Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep 
 Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v" 
 Smores over warm helvetica brown proper 
 For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter 
 Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel 
 Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia 
 Usually the shooter community chew the corpse 
 But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours 
 Day of the dead, play the ledge closely 
 Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey 
 Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially 
 Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies 
 Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes 
 All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires 
 {Money money} 
 Detonator, wire cutter, pliers 
 Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles 
 And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat 
 For a photographic token of my primordial growth 
 You parade around and kill, so damn proud 
 Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out 
 War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly 
 Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry 
 Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows 
 So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go 
  
 [Hook: El-P] 
 Another dark night, another not alright 
 Another bad ritual, more botched surgery 
 Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently 
 Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery" 
 Vicinity wander, claim no soul 
 Never let an anchor drop 
 Never had a home, never talk to strangers 
 Never trust a friend 
 This is the life and the life will not end 
  
 Money (Repeat 8x) - - ] Mr. Lif 
  
 [Aesop Rock] + (El-P) + {Mr. Lif} 
 Next time think 
 39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks... 
 Raise your drinks 
 39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks 
  
 We're not concerned with the community aloofness 
 Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is 
 Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless 
 Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon-fed 
 {Money money} 
 Money is cool, I'm only human 
 But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded 
 Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is 
 Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit 
  
 (Another dark night) 
 Calicos tread around the rabbit hole 
 Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows 
 Piss warm sugar water, what a summer canteen 
 Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green" 
 Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex 
 Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates 
 Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force 
 Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours 
 Black top pebble wars 
 Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up 
 Wants decoded came to grow in 
 No motive, it showed up in gross quotas 
 Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us 
 Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy 
 You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy 
 Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine 
 And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in 
 {Money money} 
 Both know the totem camaraderie 
 Token of equality, they post it horizontally 
 Crown the golden loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony 
 Half-mast flags, half cabs loiter properly 
 And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left 
 Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect 
 With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters 
 On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

 Let me put you up on Bob's donuts 
 Controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras 
 Mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goat's legs 
 Will they go for maple, custard, buttermilk or wolfs bane? 
 Hm, late after your cinderella pulsate and crash I was rotating casts 
 Picture if you will a witching hour on a weak night in the trenches 
 Where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven 
 With sprinkles, I know right yum 
 Whether tummy ache or fever 
 Keep the funnel cake I'm honey glaze in vitro 
 In the company of similar believers 
 Sleepless, who hear the walls breathe and foam at the facial features 
 Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated 
 Equal parts flour, faith, healing 
 Might replace your previously nominated Jesus 
 But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets 
  
 [Hook] 
 Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back 
 With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat 
 Show up around 1 never get your God back 
 If you're just tuning in, walk into the light 
 Walk into the light 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I boil oil too, not for scarfing 
 For CCs of Japanese innovation that screech into free parking 
 Purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard 
 You can chew the Eucharist in cruller form 
 Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling 
 Where jelly's not a celebrated stuffing, it's a puppet string 
 Pluck, nose for canola 
 5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere 
 Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey 
 Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures 
 Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth 
 Each progressively more sequestered 
 Yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants 
 Some lose religion or view it as superstition 
 You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them 
  
 [Hook] 
 Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back 
 With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat 
 Show up around 1 never get your God back 
 If you're just tuning in, walk into the light 
 Walk into the light 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 The fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms 
 To feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars 
 And stagger through the pulse ofthe gulch on a builder's dividends 
 Hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints 
 Seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey 
 I'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing 
 Might, fortune-teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe 
 Great, grace invaders, the first-name basis patron haters 
 Who compromise the pilot lights and flavors 
 Silent night, holy night, invite the pious out the pagan 
 Midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons 
 Can I get a fucking amen? 
 AMEN, hazelnut raiders of the lost, navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross 
 No name no dayjob 
 Know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf 
 Thanks bob 
  
 [Hook] 
 Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back 
 With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat 
 Show up around 1 never get your god back 
 If you're just tuning in, walk into the lightOne of four 
 My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz 
 I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Syosset hospital, located in Long Island, NY 
 I am 6 foot 4, I weigh 2-0-0 pounds 
 I have brown hair and green eyes 
 I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food 
 I have two brothers, Chris and Graham 
 And two parents, Paul and Jameija 
 In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy.. 
  
 This was originally not for public consumption 
 This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life 
 They know who they are.. 
 And, uh... I mean, I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them 
 I don't think this song would pay for them 
 But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further.. 
  
 This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't) 
 This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor (no it isn't) 
 My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York 
 Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris... OK 
 In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone scaffolding imploded 
 I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling 
 To the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips 
 For cigarettes and soda, shook me to casper 
 Dizzy with a nausea chaser, motor sensory eraser 
 Gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangement 
 Rose rapidly outta bog I'd never fished in 
 That abates three separate foreign meds 
 While I seems to hook lines and syncro simple fishing 
 Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body 
 But the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi 
 So now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mileage 
 Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence 
 And, I'd be lying if I said all of this 
 Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me 
 That's frail... Simply put 
 I don't know what happened, or what's still happening 
 I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity 
 JAIME, I killed the robots and I'm sorry 
 Broke down in front of you, embarrassed 
 But you lent a heart and hand that only you could 
 You're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you 
 That's my word, which is about all I have left 
 TONY, I know you know I'm crazy, cause you told me 
 But that didn't ever bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death 
 And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step 
 For makin' a cat laugh when I was walking with the dead 
 KATHRYN, mother figure, older sister, concerned beyond limits 
 Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this 
 Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits 
 Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons 
 RAIA, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed 
 An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it 
 You listened to me blab about my issues for hours 
 Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished 
 Am I a jack of all trades? No... I like to write songs though 
 Are they good? I dunno.. 
 But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it 
 So take this how you want, but know I mean it 
 I want you all to know that I'm scared 
 Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months 
 Ever in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't) 
 But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive 
 So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you 
 Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness 
 I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement 
 Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it 
  
 Thank you 
 I wish I could explain this better. (Thank you) 
 I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures. (Thank you) 
 I love you all with all that's left of me. (Thank you) 
 For helping try to kill what made a mess of me. (Thank you) 
 Somehow, someway. (Thank you) 
 I'mma get you back someday. (Thank you) 
 Just gotta figure this all out... So.. 
  
 I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back 
 How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures 
 Other men operate normally under 
 I have scoped this out from all angles, multiple times 
 I have been over everything in my head, 'till I can't think anymore 
 But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there 
 To breathe for you 
 I am lucky enough to have those people around me 
 Thank you for helping me to not die 
 Thank you for helping me to not die 
  
 Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt 
 Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt[Verse 1] 
 How to make a homemade mummy: 
 Get a corpse, get gauze, get comfy 
 Shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy 
 For the hallowed excavation of his x-marked tummy 
 Stem to stern, the butter cutter b-lines well 
 Tongues butterfly the unzipped feline shell 
 We'll be escorting vital organs 
 With the exception of the precious kitten heart 
 Into the privacy of separate pickle jars 
 Or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card 
 Shit, pick a part and scissor 
 Stomach, lung, intestine or liver 
 In a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever 
 Brain exterminated through the whiskers *kiss & blow* 
 Ditched, I blank NY alone 
 We usher in the salts that call the husk home 
 Might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids 
 Slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons 
 Limb by limb, by tail by ear by chin 
 Within the hereafter I hereby win 
 I hope you vow to meow another day and never 
 Decompose, by the way before we seal these molds 
 The shorten version goes... 
  
 [Hook] 
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2] 
 Paper playgrounds, leave your harvest 
 Take the brain out... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Gadzooks, punk's dead, last good gut wrenched 
 Antennae sam cook, black book pushead 
 Cat skulls stacked to the black hole sunset 
 Olive on a toothpick, Dagwood Bumstead 
 Tagged-hoof hatchery, matter amass naturally 
 Bad wolf, dash for the last rook castling 
 Blue ox, red plaid bass pro flannel king 
 Hasbro crown, sour apple Abba-Zabba teeth 
 In poorly taken pictures antiquating on his mantlepiece 
 Before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines 
 Folk broke bear claws over gross coffee 
 Not as milquestoast men, as los muertos walking 
 Ergo the scarecrow in rare barley 
 Squared-off harpy to armchair: say a prayer for me 
 I feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly 
 I also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy 
  
 [Hook] 
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2] 
 Major take down, eat your porridge 
 Take the brain out, leave the carcass 
  
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2] 
 Games to rain out, pleas to bargain 
 Take the brain out, wreathed in garlic 
  
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in [[X2] 
 Fading halos, feeding herpes 
 Take the brain out, eager starlets 
  
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in{Aesop Rock} 
 Yo 
 I take 10 steps with a bent left vision 
 Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village 
 I understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace 
 Then remain up in my face like top to bottom train car fill-ins 
 Let's question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect 
 I'mma blow this hex over the mission 
 Just to administer the end-all sucker punch toward its pitiful condition 
  
 {C-Rayz Walz} 
 With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized 
 Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes 
 That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots 
 As the truth hits your ears begin to cry 
 "Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care? 
 I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear 
 City lights look like bright groups of fire flies 
 Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies 
 Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries 
 Spit sparks speak to the streets 
 The skid marks are replies 
 Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals 
 The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you) 
 As I walk out my door, step into the pollution 
 (I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions 
 Physically the situation's hard to stop 
 I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks 
 Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle) 
 Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal) 
 Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing 
 Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it) 
 Table talk, salt and pepper conversation 
 Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca 
 It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes 
 Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do 
  
 {Aesop Rock}(Chorus) 
 It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum 
 Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum 
 Steadily searching for something new under the sun 
 But its stagnant, active element first of madness 
  
 Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum 
 Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum 
 Steadily searching for something new under the sun 
 But its hurtin, act of development first diversion 
  
 {C-Rayz Walz} 
 A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient 
 In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts unraveling, pacing 
 Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground) 
 The traincar used to be my apartment 
 Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out 
 Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout 
 "The blizzard's coming, the blizzard's coming!" ? 
 Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!) 
 We just getting flurries now? 
  
 {Aesop Rock} 
 Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn 
 You're movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass 
 Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang 
 But we like 1970 something 20 kliks outside Da Nang (Dear Obedience) 
 I apologize for the faulty academics 
 But they placed us in a miserable stasis 
 I let bygones be bygones 
 But tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless 
 Just ain't working the way the manual paints it 
 See I soak in a blue note factory 
 While most cats hassle bandits lamping (?) solo 
 And when the last red brick topples over the earth 
 To intercept your crooked little mess 
 I can be found in a social coma directly to your left 
 Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath 
 Regarding how to document the shady baby steps 
 I bounce checks like a modern man 
 Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift 
 Together specimens from the promised land 
 This for the thinkers 
 This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers 
 This for the absurd verdict linkers 
 This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions 
 But can't remember where his drink is 
 I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation 
 Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation 
 Answer this: when all is said and done 
 Are you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run 
 Choose one 
  
 {Chorus}[Intro] 
 We'll have more news after this commercial word 
  
 (And so it goes..) 
 At least I think was here asleep 
 Is it possible? Conceivable? 
 That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk? 
  
 [Verse] 
 In slid rhythm, fed a cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta 
 Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan 
 And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand 
 Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action 
 Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included 
 I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked 'till his beard grew 
 Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid 
 It's bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that six pack odyssey 
 Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned 
 My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings 
 While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings 
 I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection 
 I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions 
 From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge 
 To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled 
 And not a creature stirred 
 It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans 
 Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room 
 Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant 
 And skeleton in cabinet 
 This amalgam circus got a ring of fire 
 Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle 
 I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew 
 Release the hounds 
 To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker 
 I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot 
 Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo' self!" 
 I finally actualized data commission 
 Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability 
 Took a hard pledge early on 
 Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home 
 Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster 
 Sensationally seismograph 
 Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future 
 I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down 
 Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America 
 Land of the freebase, home of the triplicate grill character 
 My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-x 
 Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket 
 I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet 
 Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed 
 Wing clipper out hierarchy 
 Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie" shit 
 Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently 
 Parasol spinning casually like 
 "I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me" 
 OK, time to buckle the fuck down 
 Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin 
 You could catch the memoir in several dimensions 
 The joy-of-life logic don't employ the spite process 
 Hence your plight botches 
  
 This Be The Big 
 F-l-a-s-h-f-l-o-o-d, Flashflood 
  
 'possible' 'conceivable' 
 'possible' 'conceivable'

 'that I Sleepwalked Out Of My Apartment And Went Berzerk'Step on the lawn I keep the foot, peep 
 In the pot go six degrees of cooked geese; 
 Boiling, blitz the beach of mushed peas 
 Over ten meat hooks with a blister each 
 I'm all pincer, fevery hoodie-on hoodie-off 
 Sweat through his E.T. sheets to the worry dolls 
 Never met a quiet storm 
 That didn't grow into a choir of colliding horns 
 That go "click click clack" in territorial syntax 
 Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back 
 Pinball whiz in a thimble of Sims 
 I'm a symbol of whimsy abridged 
 Kiss Me, I'm Dead; nursing a mystery, DayQuil 
 Led Zep staring daggers down page mill 
 How pray tell do he sit pretty? 
 When the old one-two unglue in a tizzy 
  
 Please hold for the don't-play dull boy 
 Click: I am not a page or a pull toy 
 Came in the door and the floor is lava 
 Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell 
 Born homesick for an invisible address, batshit 
 Bumble and bat around catnip 
 One black-heart Katamari massive 
 Packed in a fat category-5 rat nest 
 Nose on his sleeve, holes in his inner peace 
 Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy 
 I hate you (I hate you more) 
 No, I hate you infinity 
 And Pangaea break into smithereens 
 Interlude presto change-o 
 If it move too quick (oh whey oh) 
 Right brain go write train Ramo 
 Mustache any old Monet, (no) 
 Yes 
  
 Merrily merrily merrily merrily 
 In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy 
 Frogmen schooled by the god Ed Emberley 
 Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys 
 Bet: moth into kerosene awful 
 A caution to straw men lost on Vaudeville 
 Amorally mixing business 
 With 144 Dixie Whistlers 
 Lawnchair strongman twisted whiskers 
 NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers 
 Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ring-ers 
 Are you privy to the misadventures? 
  
 It's electric, meeting in the middle of the street 
 With a lethally modified Piccolo Pete 
 There is admittedly an incredible mystique 
 To meddling in the reason a city won't sleep 
 48 strings of twelve 
 That ring ring ring whiz-bang jingle bells 
 And melt bootleg G.I. Joes to black taffy 
 Classic fire-in-the-hole backdrafting 
 Fold wildlife out of Wolf Pack wrapping 
 Full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine 
 TNT plunger in all-caps ACME 
 Blast off half of the whole damn mapscreen 
 No sling no spear 
 I'm a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears 
 Who been stung by an unlinked pinky swear 
 During his what-in-the-fuck-was-I-thinking years 
 Maybe an awkward phase 
 Like his acne and sophomore fade, played 
 Calling all out-of-work action figures 
 It was death by Saturn Missiles[Aesop Rock] *acapella* 
 Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages 
 When bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water won) 
 I wrote the book that shook America to splinters 
 In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township 
 Call Baron Münchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig 
 Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays 
 Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty 
 I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag 
  
 It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels 
 To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing 
 Carbon based pardons ain't enough 
 My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus 
 We urchins merkin on daily 
 I catapult brain opera past basic 
 Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill 
 Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace 
 If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops 
 Which explains missing the premise 
 Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die 
 Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off 
 Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes 
 Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time 
 Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother? 
 Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers 
 Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner 
 Smackin the third clear out the park 
 Going gone (To infinity and beyond!) 
 I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers 
 Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators 
 Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily 
 I deal with tangible goods 
 And avoid manufacturing food for landfills 
 I've seen friends bow to needles 
 I've seen needles bow to records 
 I've seen boughs break 
 I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake 
 I've seen the proud break 
 I've seen a lot for a blind soldier 
 Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in 
 The rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs 
 I'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice 
 Add a hatchet slice for kicks 
 And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids 
 Life's hard, life's easy 
 Life's everyting in between 
 Life's Peachy like James and the Giant 
 And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it 
 And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it 
 And I like it (Don't try it like that) 
  
 [Movie sample] 
 "Yes the bough is low 
 That's the way it goes though.... 
 Maybe I should just give up or stop trying 
 But life is so uncertain, so short 
 I've got to keep on searching 
 And wherever it takes me, I've got to go" 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem 
 Set a low goal, I arrive late 
 I'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine 
 Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother 
 (Oh you got heart?) 
 I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates 
 Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate 
 The falcon hates the mockingbird 
 The farmer hates the drought 
 I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all" 
 And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!) 
 Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style 
 To be your lawfully wedded head trip 
 To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm 
 Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!) 
 I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone 
 Walkin like a Jabberwocky 
 Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing 
 It’s just like Christmas with a shallow stocking 
 Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage) 
 You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him 
 Soundin' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering 
 Yeah, it's kinda funny, isn't it? 
 How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus 
  
 [Hook] 4x 
 Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase 
 Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes 
  
 Skeptical of the handshakes {*repeat to fade*}[Chorus: Antoinette (sample)] 
 One one one one one 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 Don't nobody move, don't nobody move (one) 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 Don't nobody move, don't nobody move 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 I spell 666 star six nine click 
 Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch 
 Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal 
 Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel 
  
 [Verse 2: Rob Sonic] 
 Now he sells le cars in Montie burns' Cazal Frames 
 Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train 
 Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood 
 The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds 
  
 [Verse 3: Aesop Rock] 
 Up around noon 
 Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube 
 The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel 
 One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel 
 Identical water-separated pools 
 It was clever 
 But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved 
 In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly 
 Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky 
  
 [Verse 4: Rob Sonic] 
 16-panel head mutton chop and Ambulax 
 Double pits to chesty got the ESPY on a camel's back 
 Handle that Huffy wit' a timely parry 
 And get all up in your kitchen money, Guy Fieri 
  
 [Verse 5: Aesop Rock] 
 There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss 
 In the spaces between being told you are shit 
 I would openly suggest identifying the closest 
 And collectively agreeing to meet if the sky opens 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Aesop Rock and (Rob Sonic)] 
 Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) Ma'am? (Ma'am?) 
 I'd like to speak to a supervisor

 One one one one one 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 Don't nobody move, don't nobody move (one) 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 One two and freeze, don't nobody move 
 Don't nobody move, don't nobody move 
  
 [Verse 6: Rob Sonic] 
 Back alley brawl over party guests who want a 
 Steak tartare but we're hardly pet food 
 Charlie check booth, Brody's right 
 You're gonna need a bigger boat and a Holy Diver 
  
 [Verse 7: Aesop Rock] 
 Aggravated people driving lemons over limits 
 With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics 
 Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor 
 End up another poached foriegner 
  
 [Verse 8: Rob Sonic] 
 Handcuffed down to a toothless tease 
 Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine 
 With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter 
 And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together 
 Been through the desert on a horse that's nameless 
 Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked 
 Shores invaded by the new marines 
 That tear the roof off this mother like Buford T 
  
 [Verse 9: Aesop Rock] 
 Untrained pet with a pen name 
 Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway 
 Step around the rhythm of the red rain 
 Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame 
  
 [Verse 10: Rob Sonic] 
 Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty) 
 Flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey 
 Package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30 
 There's a man with a mask and an app that can dial Fergie 
  
 [Pre-Chorus: Aesop Rock and (Rob Sonic)] 
 Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) Sir? (Sir?) 
 I'd like to speak to a supervisor

 Good evening 
 All right 
 Yeah 
 Happy to be breathing 
 Yeah 
 I am alive 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
  
 [Scratches] 
 "You look like you've seen a ghost" 
  
 [Spoken: Aesop Rock] 
 Are you asleep? Or are you 
 Are you awake? Nah, man, I'm done 
 I'm showered, I'm everything 
 Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms 
 Let's go 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Most copious, rains soaked the opiates 
 Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate 
 Woke up with a ghost farm, focused on his groceries 
 When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly 
 On the lawn, let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn 
 The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long 
 So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em 
 "I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome" 
 Interesting in a sense 
 Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence 
 How quickly they will lift their heads 
 And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue 
 Said, "You're living by the bayonet (but how alive are you?)" 
 Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette 
 Elbows on the table, lobster bibbin' on the ready set 
 He said, "But how alive?", I dunno, homie, you decide 
 (No, you decide) Fine! How alive? Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive (How alive?) Too alive 
 And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride 
 Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public 
 With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?) 
 We the legends that hunt with the unremembered 
 Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor 
 Who snuck around the art police and all related governments 
 To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip 
 Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership 
 To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it 
 And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat 
 When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me? 
 Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly 
 The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry 
 And summers in the mud (Mud), winters by the tracks (Tracks) 
 No story goes untold, Aes is back 
  
 I got a handful rockin' the same poker-face 
 Down to dance around the table like they own the place 
  
 [Scratches] 
 "You look like you've seen a ghost" 
  
 I got the whole world thinkin' it's a holiday 
 'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away 
  
 [Scratches] 
 "You look like you've seen a ghost" 
  
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too alive 
 (How alive?) Too aliveThis fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring; 
 The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing 
 I'm broke. I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat 
 Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (H-O-P-E) 
 I paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell 
 Tortured 
 Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled 
 I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters 
 Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter 
 Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram 
 Cuz I hobble with hollow hands 
 Please pan the nozzle 
 We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients 
 But honor modern replacements circling now basics 
 I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh) 
 Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse 
 Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible 
 That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical 
 I am not a crook 
 I cook the wick at both ends 
 Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance 
 Life 
 Sight beyond 
 Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone 
 Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on 
 And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis 
 Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is 
 I alone personify mankind's collective sulk 
 As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk 
 Face it 
 Die 
 Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained 
 But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway 
 Make it rain 'til the levy breaks 
 My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine 
 And it saddens me like televised casualties 
 I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes; 
 You don't want to miss it 
 As a token of my discontent regarding the equation 
 I'm officially closed for consultation 
  
 [Hook] 
 I float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...[Intro 2x] 
 Watch your step, Watch your mouth 
 We all know the way that a punk goes out 
  
 4 and 21 crows 
 None go south 
 For the supper when a punk goes out 
 Checkerboard of mothballed death-forms 
 Hauled via vaudeville canes 
 And encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way 
 Watch, our father 
 Commuters from the farms with news of el Chupacabra 
 Who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull 
 Dumb full blood suckers 
 Only the chum suffers 
 Pine box butcher 
 Encouraging poor lighting 
 Said “a pall bore's not a sure sign of jarred lightning" 
 Harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born 
 Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art 
 Chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders 
 More for the hive mind 
 Less for the land mine finders 
 Fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery 
 Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee 
 Straight out the front 
  
 4 and 22 
 Cue the cut throat mouth 
 Chew together when a punk goes out 
 Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls 
 Never run truck jewels 
 Run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves 
 In guttural grunts 
 Smothering buttery lung ramen 
 Early sign of punk shows up on the diagnostic 
 Hm, pardon if I seem stand off-ish 
 All the see-sawed loss, I can't call it 
 All petite drawn straws and orange caution 
 Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement 
 It's gaudy, plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share an office, all evolves salty 
 Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits 
 Maybe sin ‘ll make for sugar-flavored flesh 
 Kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw 
 The rest are recipes 
 Caw![Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 I start my city with a brick (one brick) 
 Then add another brick (two bricks) 
 Brick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels 
 I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes 
 Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows 
 My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids 
 Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels 
 Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals 
 And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal 
 Models then swallowed by famished potholes 
 And I'm tired, tied up on these functions 
 Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league 
 Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed 
 Run, breathe, sit, bellow 
 Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo 
 Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback 
 When Little Billy bought a tugboat 
 Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab 
 Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches 
 Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them 
 Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet 
 The room reeks of a thousand bayonets 
 I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian 
 Connecting life with that little species of idiots 
 We've now officially scraped barrel bottom 
 Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him 
 I know a planet made of porcelain 
 And once I get tired of holding this gavel up 
 Y'all prayer circles met him up born again 
 I ain't too good for tap water 
 Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking 
 You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility 
 You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's (That's more fun anyway) 
 Some cats float, some cats don't 
 I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric 
 Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless 
 Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep 
  
 [Aesop and Illogic overlapping each other] 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Platforms have been erected 
 Effigies built 
 Slogans coined, songs have been written 
 Rumors have been circulated 
 Autographs faked 
 The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape 
 Moving boxes have been worn out 
 Mantelpieces dusted 
 Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted 
 Curtains have been closed 
 Sleepers all waked 
 The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape 
  
 [Hook: Illogic] 
 Now with my trusty paperclip 
 I pick locks of thoughts vault 
 Finding the garden barren 
 The harvest fruitless 
 Only the tree of life flourishing 
 Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless 
 Is that predestination or is it by design? 
 That I'm trapped in time sand 
 Show radio mission control but for my rhymes 
 Man because I can like aluminium 
 And I recycle my consciousness 
 This is just a note 
 For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence 
  
 [Verse 2: Illogic] 
 Wingless angels 
 Stroll a top shapeless cotton balls 
 With halos in your syringe 
 Celestial ground is found, broken 
 Exposing a bottomless depth where heartless spines awake to devour the small piece of your soul that's left 
 You're immersed in sound, floating 
 Aimless destination 
 Drop anchor to gain stability 
 Stare out potions, restrain fertility 
 Pedestal talk is a token soaked in pockets where lives' topics lack conceptual, ridicule 
 The night breathes, but light's choking 
 Darkness occupies the throne where poems are persecuted 
 The purity at time diluted 
 Rhymes are executed for genre, I'm told 
 When has beens attempt to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold 
 Life's an origami box and I'm hidden within the fold 
 So when the yarn unravels I won't be caught by surprise 
 And as society's fabric of orthodoxies dismantle I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise 
 See, when the canvas stands before me I'm compelled to spill a vision 
 For the sinners that listen: I got three spikes and a thorn crown 
 It seems I need a new soul because mine is worn down 
 But from the pregnancy of my hardship was born style 
 Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought 
 Finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols 
 Drowning in melted ice, to reinforce that breath is vital 
 If your father and his father were fish out of water you must break the cycle 
 How many times must a plant be uprooted, for it to die? 
 When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky 
 So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs with a million watts 
 And throws the switch, sparks filament 
 Herding blue giants and flocks 
 I stand on my own two, aura illuminated in red 
 Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit 
 Sacrificing itself for the health of a masochistic culture 
 Yearning for the truth that we speak, but refuse to hear it 
  
 [Hook][Intro] 
 It would've been the most beautiful second-coming of Christ 
 That anyone had ever seen 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 The water ain't safe, the land's made of water 
 I hug a half-empty glass my dignity's tryin' to pawn her 
 I'm tryin' to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer 
 But I rather be drinkin' coffee with my cigarette foster 
 Can a run-away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter to force the brutal truth of daily marketplace wars through the roof? 
 I mean, I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning 
 And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling 
 But I'm sick, I've plowed these fields a thousand times over 
 Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quarters 
 And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea 
 I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow, shouting: "Finally!" 
 Take a number, the apple seeds raineth upon your slumber 
 A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter 
 My every whim acted upon has gone loopy 
 But I play a game called 
 "Let's prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings." 
 I split the radius of go-getter bellies, reconnaissance 
 Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze 
 Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease 
 Tummy full of sand, running man, impossible, stop 
 There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust 
 Surfin' the urban Iditarod, certainly flushed 
 Now one in the hand is worth two atop the tallest cedar 
 But what lies inside my heart is off the motherfuckin' meter 
  
 [Hook] 
 The water ain't safe no more 
 I'm just tryin' to build myself to act as a truly better man, damn 
 See, the water ain't safe no more 
 I'm just tryin' to be a solid oak tree 
 For every child to carve its name across 
 The water ain't safe no more 
 I'm just tryin' to be the dream 
 Of every peasant the hurricane can offer 
 See, the water ain't safe no more 
 I'm just tryin' to be somebody 
 I can talk to in the morning with a smile 
 The water ain't safe no more 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And I've always been a 40-night chronologic hostage 
 Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch 
 Wingless anime idol 
 I don't play in the man race cycle, hope floater 
 Gloating inside carnal indifference 
 'Til doom cops a slot and potent quotas 
 I'm 20 something, pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways 
 Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless 
 Now tip-toe across a lost cause 
 Because a lost cause found don't mean you found a cause 
 That means you found a lost cause 
 Okay, now I've been here for role-playing 
 Slaying my here and now 
 To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow 
 And it's incredible 
 Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels 
 But bad apples ain't sweet 
 And cretins' saddles ain't that memorable 
 I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide 
 Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine 
 I wear a tiger-striped ego and bivouac my progression 
 Where the kindlings formulated 
 Through the flesh of the oppressors 
 Now, God had a flask, I can prove it 
 You really think the thirteen loops that used honor 
 Spawned me a sober unit? 
 Check potion, addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler 
 Adhered to the back bone, stone pusher 
 Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement 
 That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison 
 And it's beautiful, I keep a stick inside my hand 
 And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram 
  
 [Hook] 
 The water ain't safe no more

 "You ain't shit man, your story's a joke 
 You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope." 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Stay awake little misfit 
 Her lips wet a very particular mischief 
 Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let 
 Or settle for a warm, burgundy bubble out of her beak instead 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Hey, tequila to free the worm 
 Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath 
 His personal pale rabbit 
 At the hole's end her delicate mitten tipped 
 For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six 
 Silly, predictability is a bitch 
 Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board 
 She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar." 
 "Funny, you're less of a fixer-upper than my last whore." 
 Crass is Similac to the milky wit of today's youths 
 Both chuckle out 
 Next couple on the house 
 Next couple on the couch 
 Swapping social coma rants 
 Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans 
 Motor-mouths 
 The key to open his closure: 
 Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster 
 And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly 
 Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep 
  
 [Hook] 
 An object at rest tends to remain at rest 
 And an object in motion tends to remain in motion 
 With the same speed... slow down 
 With the same speed... slow down 
 With the same speed... slow down 
 And in the same direction 
 Down... down... down... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist 
 If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff 
 And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker 
 Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians 
 Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads 
 Mostly biblical, but not cause he believed 
 But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly 
 Feverishly sponged up the information high 
 Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck 
 She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back 
 Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks 
 Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back 
 Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from Corinthians 
 Sunk into the comforts of a kid again 
 Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him 
 This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end 
 Tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him 
 The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates 
 Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion 
 But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him 
  
 [Hook] 
 An object at rest tends to remain at rest 
 And an object in motion tends to remain in motion 
 With the same speed... slow down

 Down... down... down... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies 
 In the valley of the irritable Aggie 
 Any sincerity, miracles, or memory buried in the back-seat 
 By the hazardous materials was seriously gasping 
 Here he is in action trying to patch up the attraction 
 Figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion 
 Penned a couple chapters 'bout a sassy pair of magnets 
 With a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage 
 Never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language 
 Was fashioned around the aspirin in his cabinets 
 Asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact 
 This is an exact imitation of how she react: 
 "You ain't shit man, your story's a joke 
 You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope." 
 Man she knows five chores, more coke, and all fours 
 Said, "Leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door." 
 Bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum 
 Consuming every skull and crossbones in the room 
 In under two minutes, he fuming with a flipped lid, stormed into the crib 
 And found her body on the tiles like, "No she didn't!", yes she did 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Stay awake little misfit 
 Her lips wet a very particular mischief

 Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh) 
 Up push the daisies till the soil is stale 
 In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go) 
 Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Once upon a time in the days of yore 
 When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore 
 There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang 
 Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same 
 Peg leg navigate him starboard to port 
 By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!" 
 And you should tell them where you situate the gold 
 That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones 
 Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank 
 Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs 
 And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year 
 He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer 
 Ten summers prior on a night like this 
 Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west 
 Swore it blew him a kiss 
 When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a 
 F-f-f-fish 
 "What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered 
 Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder 
 To deck circled the vessel 360 swiftly 
 Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey 
 Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar 
 He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War 
 Like this dude either got two glass eyes 
 Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side 
 Now he knew what he saw 
 But had to prove he was raw 
 So he raped and he pillaged and 
 And he feud and he brawled 
 Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke 
 And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats 
 (Hey!) Meanwhile, back in the now 
 Got a brand new skeleton crew on the move out 
 When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow 
 They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth 
 Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease 
 Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed 
 And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat 
 Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map 
 One look down and lept off the dock 
 See if you can guess where X marked the spot 
 The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave 
 Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid 
 Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much 
 Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched 
 But see the vitamin deficiency was strong 
 So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog 
 Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand 
 Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand 
 And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put 
 The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land 
 I wish I could tell you that it ended happy 
 Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping 
 Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer 
 But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water 
 No lie, scout's honor, got a million more 
 From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores 
 Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails 
 Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 Dead men tell no tales 
 ..Dead men tell no tales

 For want of a nail the shoe was lost 
 For want of a shoe the horse was lost 
 For want of a horse the rider was lost 
 For want of a rider the battle was lost 
 For want of a battle the kingdom was lost 
 And all for the want of a horseshoe nail 
  
 There is a hole in front of the shovel 
 Shovel in front of the brawn 
 Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn 
 Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade 
 Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames 
 Few would clue the crew into the civil 
 Skip the food and land like you the man 
 Who flew the coop over the pitbulls 
 Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies 
 And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate 
 Cops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens 
 A is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer" 
 Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater 
 Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's 
 Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades 
 And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now 
 For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down 
 The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him 
 Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them 
 Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck 
 Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous 
 And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate 
 To the taketh away decide to maketh his day (do it) 
 All the stoic odium glow in a cold holster 
 To where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters

 No mountain too high 
 No city too far 
 No coma tonight 
 No city tomorrow 
 No fire too live 
 No city too charred 
 No treaty to sign 
 No city to guard 
  
 I picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach 
 Skin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up 
 I'd known it wasn't roses 
 But hoped it was less corrosive 
 Coastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis 
 Like homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man 
 Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand 
 And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony 
 With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what? 
 Chinny chin-up and the city picked this 
 In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma 
 Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer 
 Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver 
 If you make no friends on the way to the top rung 
 There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck 
 But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard 
 So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons 
 All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry 
 Will he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive? 
 If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground 
 They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town 
 Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out 
 Or sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles 
 Riders to the east, not a wild tribes 
 Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles high

 Who's that walking with a hole in his head? 
 Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread 
 What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times? 
 I tell 'em... ah, fuck it, yo! 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck 
 Gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrastle the fangs off of my fist 
 Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres 
 On some holiday in Cambodia with motor-home appraisers 
 Pagans fade into the Kodachrome - now, later 
 With a lid to brow staple 
 Revisit the cobra loading zone 
 Molar foaming, but he hold his own wound 
 Cauterized, by the Zippo he had stole that afternoon 
 And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built 
 Grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip 
 "Be all you can be" just never soothed us (Nope!) 
 You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush 
 Holler scum's lullaby 
 Live from the ultra-fly, sham city bunker 
 Where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly 
 Hush little baby, timeout! 
 The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick 
 But learn to peck your eyes out 
 Of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths 
 Pick on the visions that buzz, bet on the kitten's escape 
 Solder the piston to pump - out a veteran amplifier 
 And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire 
 Flush the moppet hootenanny 
 Who could fancy, honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy? 
 Trooper, scoop the food in pantry 
 Ante up, stupid! 
 May delusion feed em foofi candy 
 And pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping 
 Pocket all you can now 
 Block' will lead the lambs down 
 To the cold cutlery outfit, slaughter beef and cow tip 
 Pour the chief some fountain soda, motor prone to pen the holy opus 
 And pry this monkey off the Scoliosis like 
  
 [Hook] 
 Who's that walking with a hole in his head? 
 Bazooka Tooth, gemini, I came to break bread 
 What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times? 
 I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go 
 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 It's like never mind the bullocks 
 Fuck, like every other week these hipster tabloids 
 Jumping on and off my Sex Pistol's bullets 
 Like every other week he spins the bottle 
 Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow 
 Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow 
 Cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile 
 Fortunate for me, it coincides with what comes natural 
 So the mongrels that I run with turn the "fuck you's" into fast food 
 Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust 
 Nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his mother's truck (uh-oh) 
 Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag 
 Will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag (bang) 
 This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers 
 Stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns 
 Tend to bubble up, weathermen huddle up 
 Today, the son of one too many "yes sir's" 
 Kings his checkers, watch the double jump 
 Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down 
 To the last diseases, it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister 
 Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard 
 I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging 
 Like Serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing 
 Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace: 
 Kill every motherfucker but me 
 You cool with that? Cool, bang 
 You? Cool, hang 
 You? No? Uh..bang? Cool 
 Sorry, dog, rules is rules 
 And too long have I followed yours 
 I'm trying to get them years back 
 And walk through every Cypher with dynamite in a beer hat

 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 Fast cars, danger, fire and knives 
 I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed[El-P] 
 I brought that genuine shit in '96 
 Before you knew the underground or independent existed 
 I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick 
 After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit 
 No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging 
 Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering 
 A hardcore poetic informed without burglary 
 Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me 
 Everytime I prescribe a new pill, revolution 
 Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution 
 Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks 
 "Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks 
 Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from 
 Screaming out "Independent as fuck" with an insane tongue 
 With an indelible squad of design monsters 
 Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters 
 So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus 
 Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit 
 Preposterous sonics taking the world hostage 
 Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress 
 Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn 
 Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin." 
 Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine 
 So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in 
 So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences 
 Waiting way before the four you had laced in 
 And I was taught to wait patient (Why?) 
 Only faggots make shit up just to get famous 
 So when I finally blew up I remained sick 
 Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement 
 Back when the independent scene remained faceless 
 We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it 
 Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix 
 Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels 
 Hold it sacred, living it for the culture 
 Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures 
 That's why I always get respect from true soldiers 
 While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop's over." 
 FUCK YOU, hip hop just started 
 It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it 
 But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it 
 Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit 
 New slang, new thought, new sound 
 Who's heart you thought you had? 
 You clown, you don't, you drown 
 I won't dumb it down, I'm dumbing now for these rounds 
 I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns 
 You're a mime motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds 
 So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down 
 My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about 
 Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one 
 And even though they were soft they had fun 
 But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from 
 Some of these faggots used to send me their demos 
 I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels 
 But since they had no identity from the start 
 They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part 
 They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold 
 Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old 
 I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap 
 Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard 
 Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages 
 Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit 
 I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once 
 And ya'll trying to chase me 
 You don't innovate because you can't innovate 
 It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys 
 Keep your identity crisis under the table 
 I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous

 Wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher 
 And money is an ugly god we all fall for 
 I got land mammal, cannibal, natural evolving squackbox 
 That means when I wake up and decide to comprise the new shit 
 It's not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did 
 Puff the magic komodo bitch 
 Rappers stuffed kimonos and shark fame at a perfect working unit 
 Look, I'm done 
 B-boy, feed that to the needy 
 Shut your liquor hole, fuck you in 3D 
 EasyI could make 'em all dance, or I can sleep 
 I can walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete 
 People are made of match sticks, life is bred of flames 
 Noted the craft work bore the last smirk of the Damien mainframe 
 My boxcar siphons third rail juice from lost poets 
 Inhabit ocean bottom with a bin of rotten scapegoat pardons Note to self: 
 Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies 
 Where participants squeeze in last giggle then widdle sacrificial finales 
 I can tie my bootlaces alone, save the knee deep offerings 
 Sorta brings you coughing bunk persona to light 
 I might, Build anti-malignant railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent 
 Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station 
 What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors? 
 "Kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer:" 
  
 (Dear Sir or Madame, your son or daughter's embarrassed humankind 
 Consuming booze and gut-fuel, till their cruise had crossed the line)

 Man, huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep

 Does this picket fence hang on to your dreams kitten? 
 You'll probably never hear this song 
 Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen 
  
 (I smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space 
 Now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face 
 Now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches 
 Do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?) 
  
 Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more 
 I leave footprints in fours, two for bipeds, two more to break the door 
 You can practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery 
 Brothers and sisters mothering stickler cabinet, mad and shit 
 I'll fix your wing for a penny and a parable 
 Yeah, but this friendship sunk with a barrel full of tarots pulled 
 Snake eyes harbor bad shiners 
 Then wonder why the cauldron sitting at the their rainbows ending 
 Rocks garbage bag liners (garbage bag liners) 
 I sat to breathe. Adam and Even without the Apple seed's useless 
 (I sat to breathe) Bashful boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks 
 (I sat to breathe) I breathed too hard nearly, metamorph castle loose pins 
 Now I stand to breath as not to disturb the plumage 
 And I know that sob story, it no longer turns my stomach 
 Hollering wolf in the form of one frustrated culprit 
 Caught a love tap full of washed up stardom, melted trying to milk it 
 Win a ticket to ride white lines highway sideways knelt it, smelt it 
 One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of 
 Laughter baths that hung from my rafters 
 See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses 
 That clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck) 
 Now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in 
 But I ain't about to say that I'm the only catch you got bubbling 
 You're lucky, somehow you've managed to befriend some good people 
 Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure 
  
 (Knock knock. Fuck off. Kicking his lip across the floor 
 'til the archival vinyl venom soak the lure 
 Anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners 
 Fusing a million majesty murders, then stole your crown) 
  
 Oh wait, that's right, you discovered me right? 
 Offered up the peace pipe 
 Then oh, it's all cotton candy when Aesop rocked a b-line 
 He's acting foolish left in the middle of laying bricks 
 (but we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks) 
 Oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle 
 Built foundation out passion and brother's dusty Tascam 
 Studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems, syllable placement 
 You just mad because somewhere in there you came and went 
 (And I ain't the type to dwell) Dismissed it as casually non-compatible and bounced 
 Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like 
 'Oh that sounds fresh' or 'Damn that shit is garbage, what happened? I'm not even laughing' 
 Yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked) 
 You choked a few comments to the wrong Vulcan who out of respect and honor leaked your program 
 Now like were, both trying to sit and breathe another dawn so my advice 
 To you is when I say "move on" just move on[Introduction:] 
 I'm twice born, once in 7-something 
 Once as the resurrection of honorable function 
 Been shoveling coal as the engine's doctor 
 Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in the posture 
 The maintenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment 
 Was, is, and forever will be a luxury 
 I'm a sovereignty columnist fathering doom document 
 Curséd version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant 
  
 [Interlude (spoken):] 
 (Oh my Lord, what have I gotten myself into? 
 Seems like I woke up in yesterday again 
 Another day, another dream…) 
  
 [Verse One:] 
 I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification 
 Sure as blurry mayhem had ‘em spent (Zen freeze) 
 Stuck until my friend leaves, puppet for the plummet committee 
 Sputtering bum, numb enough to stomach the city 
 Who’s that hugging the silhouetted willows where the hill’s crest pan out? 
 Barter candy-coated crab apples and sugar-dipped death hand outs 
 I got a plan, I'll tourniquet my quest 
 Then feed a needle in the bad ending to mute the mess 
 When patience gallops with absentee ballots, I shove in the button 
 Strutting to exhibit mankind’s hostility function with a (heave) 
 Paling in comparison to Matthias, Goliath 
 Lies the rickety frame of the wicked silence 
 I died the day my nameless creator and I bumped eyelids 
 Swear to Christ we saw the same thing for a second (What’s that?) 
 The grand mosaic depicting historical glory of the legend 
 Nursed me through the time stick-and-stone mixers hexed my fertile crescent 
 Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear 
 Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair 
 My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly 
 So every second of discontent’s logged accordingly 
 Now let’s turn mummy subtle perfection to preserve glory condition 
 And pray for the day a starchild tugs the ribbon 
 Better land a two-hand grip on that spoonful-of-sugar medical chaser 
 Credible crazer antidote's terrible, taste her 
 Barter with a Stolen Soul Peddler, pigeon backed feather pen 
 Never said a grin implied health 
 Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid blend of fabrics I deemed practical 
 Now is you is or is you ain’t compatible? 
 I feel the wind in my opinions 
 Plus hyper clutched to crush one’s gingerbread tenement awful 
 It’s like the day the great oak met the sawmill 
 A lifeline of spectacular expansion meets the reaper at the hand of one man’s tantrums 
 My friend’s got a book about dreams. I look and laugh 
 I dreamed a book about my friends and still can’t decipher the half 
 Chatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed 
 Battered on the brink of disease 
 (Well) I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems), I am (tin and chrome) 
 Grin and groans, fuck it, I’m tinted quinacridone 
 Blow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush 
 And felt as if I’d actually accomplished something 
 Fortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment 
 Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening 
 Caught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks 
 And stared him down until he fixed it 
  
 Oh, fashion? It’s cool and all, but what about God? 
 (Oh God? well he’s the man, but I mean, what about reading?) 
 What like novels? Man, that don’t hold my attention. How about television? 
 (Television hurts my brain. How about walking in the rain?) 
 Oh I hate walking. It’s boring. How about some old-fashioned gone fishin'? 
 (Yeah, fishing’s great, but I just hate hooking the bait. Let’s dance) 
 Nah, I got two left feet plus motion sickness. How about breakfast? 
 (Man I’m hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money) 
 Let’s fly a kite. (Let’s burn the generals). Let’s sell lemonade. (Let’s drink) 
 Let’s poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back, and watch it sink 
 (Nah, let’s fail a pupil once a year at random to shake the academy) 
 Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment. (Strategy) 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 Well, I’ll make a waterfall out of water and autumn 
 Sorta caught ‘em when their guards mimicked the vintage knuckle drag sagged in the coffin 
 I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit 
 Cried a river yesterday, ain’t shed a tear since 
 ‘Gimmie gimmie’, crooned the Old Yeller community cartoon 
 The carousel ballooned extravagant. Aware 
 Inviting, yet I’m sworn to adamant manner and saddle in worn head, thorax, and abdomen 
 To primitive horseback galloping 
 My index finger’s dressed in my talisman 
 Branded up in the jackal skin, I spy mark of the product 
 Well, one must pardon ye old common sheep detour weaving graceful through the prime directive column 
 Pray the virus retreats to allotted phylum 
 Beanstalk with a fiend walk and my name is mud 
 But that’s got a ring to it, so my soil welcomes the flood 
 I walk as God’s practical joke on man, practically broke 
 And if they raise my rent again, I’ll spend my nights practically soaked 
 Who spit silk dimension through the noose looped by the rafters? 
 After lack of reasoning, dead ‘em. (It’s like "three, two, one, bedlam") 
 Ooh, I’m hung. I clung to hope, but see you in hell 
 I’ll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt 
 Sturdy iron grillage, tin can skeleton 
 Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants 
 Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence 
 That stairway to heaven’s merely a legend so the peasants dream well 
  
 [Outro] 
 (Blesséd peasants, blesséd peasant dream well 
 Every blesséd peasant’s just trying to dream well…)[Intro] (x16) 
 Aesop Rock (Aesop Rock) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice 
 The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes 
 Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe 
 Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this.. 
  
 I carve a notch in my wall for every stall 
 Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall 
 Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presence 
 Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn bloodsport 
  
 Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company 
 Pumping out wise beads like, plot sneak-attacks on dry leaves, dunce 
 Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin' 
 Bad seeds blossom the Wookiee walk. Hawk and 
  
 Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find 
 The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind 
 When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster 
 I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster 
  
 And ascend. Your riddles yield a little plastic blend 
 Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig 
 Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers 
 Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers 
  
 Once my brethren disperse 
 My god, you think the heavens touched the earth then 
 Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse 
 But I don't. Confide: wine and water chose me 
 Bored: lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me 
  
 Ok, I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies 
 Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes 
 It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell 
 Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics 
  
 Now someone's approached the rope, shaken like snow-globes 
 Other sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (Yeah) 
 Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee 
 But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me 
  
 See, there's a time when... rhyme and... 
 Paint combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is like 
 Picture your imagery embellished 
 With the hellish aspects of the swarms' forlorn facets 
  
 Soul crafted fact cats, boroughin', left perennial tenants discouraged in 
 Discussin' my four seasons flourishing, uh! 
 Searching, perching, poetic lead poison 
 Poised in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride 
  
 I'm a animated style machine intervening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction 
 From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden 
 You flash identify by the genus, species and class. Start to chuckle 
  
 Buckle the architecture til it fell through 
 Kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value 
 By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (yeah I'll...) 
 I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated 
  
 So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley 
 Radically weak assume the colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough 
 That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher 
 Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting 
  
 I live for the moment of truth when Big Willie rapper 
 Acknowledges failure and states "Goddamn my shit is trash" 
 "It's time to let go." Tin man banging upon his chest to hear the echo 
 (Heartless, kid. Hollow compartments.) 
  
 Be we the people of the united, starving artistic 
 Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union 
 I'm cluing into the poison panoramics brew the panic situations 
 It fucks a little with my brittle gift 
  
 I tell myself "Stay" (Stay)... up high 
 Make a mockery of sun and moon and star 'till they hand over the sky 
 My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is 
 Invade the town while village elders holler "Who the fuck's this?" 
  
 See: hipper cats aggravated, trudge through the muds 
 Quicken ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood 
 Rugged serpentine climb, pebble to rock 
 Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not 
  
 I'm, Ae-*fucking*-sop Rock, mic bizarro 
 Proper application of the soul by my standard 
 Candid once position from which instigations spawn 
 And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like... 
  
 Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like 
 Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope...[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 The dirty dishes are becoming self-aware 
 Even the roaches like "I wouldn't raise my children here" 
 Simple syrup in his veins, dirty nails, lizard brain 
 Eyes wide, spine like a saltlick in pissing rain (pssss) 
 ASR Schroder split the rent with ghosts and bacterial cultures 
 Might track poltergeists prints through his Folgers, gross 
 Home is where the unholy sojourn 
 Dead sea bath tub 
 Never mind his welfare 
 Party at the penthouse carpeted in pet hair 
 Fridge full of black deli meat and dead air 
 Sill prefer it to the overbearing lens flare 
 And death stare Plinko and an at risk eco 
 System, egos over peace, love, and wisdom 
 Police shooting everything 
 Media's a fuck show 
 Religion is a scapegoat for cut-throats 
 Fuck no 
  
 [Hook 1: Aesop Rock] 
 I ain't going out there, man 
 I don't trust no one out there, man 
 You don't even know what's out there, man 
 Man 
  
 [Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman] 
 Sycophants is on the prowl so I don't need to do laundry 
 I'll dry myself with paper towels 
 Can't have a decent conversation with the butcher, baker, or candlestick maker 
 At least they smoking vapor now 
 I still am not going to vacate and ain't breaking out 
 It's such a boring scene 
 I found more buoyancy in quarantine 
 Accommodations second rate 
 At least it's an environment that I can regulate 
 Like I was Warren G 
 I got a fan and bucket full of ice cubes 
 Fuck what's popping on the street 
 I gotta sweep up mice poo 
 I waged a war against the spiders and was left with the mosquitoes 
 But these blood suckers leave a bump 
 Those blood suckers always want to free-load 
 Yo, who's that peeking in my key hole trying to keep it on the d-low 
 Plain and simple, mine's my favorite simple mind 
 So I'm closing all the windows and I'm shutting all the blinds 
  
 [Hook 2: Homeboy Sandman] 
 I ain't goin' out there, son 
 I don't trust no one out there, son 
 I don't even know what's out there, son 
 Son 
  
 [Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle] 
 Yo, I got a big-ass TV and my house has four of 'em 
 Some of y'all is cutting the cords I'm adding more of 'em 
 Fuck foraging, I do the shit that I can sit and do 
 Maybe in the future we can fly by a living room 
 Or order from Grub Hub but it ain't no pasta left 
 Outside is where my distant cousins get shot to death 
 Plus I'm very broke, I ain't even got a buck for the ferry boat 
 If something dope happens throw it on periscope 
 A meerkat? Seen it. I ain't trying to hear that 
 I'm planted in my zone because home is where it's weird at 
 Anything I want I locate with little to no wait 
 Through a vast network of homies that work for post-mates 
 Hella spies still sitting here, so watch me rotate 
 Outside is full of processed sugar and traffic jams 
 Device charged, apps in hand, I'm a handy-man 
 If you want to give me some energy come and visit me 
  
 [Hook 3: Open Mike Eagle] 
 Because I ain't goin' out there, fam 
 I don't trust no one out there, fam 
 I don't even know what's out there, fam 
 DamnI now present to you 
 Music, music, music, music 
 Music to make you stagger 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I've been a biplane dog fighter 
 Henson invention Trooper 
 Burst the result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing 
 Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty 
 Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints 
 God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?" 
 I sit back five dimensions 
 Only to mostly over cook the specimen 
 Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys 
 All Hail Mary's and Hello Dolly's! 
 I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now 
 Who holds the fifth golden ticket? 
 Tour the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets 
 The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence 
 Y'all hesitate to fetch it! 
 I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape 
 Pterodactyl circling turtle 
 I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow 
 Suck and rust the oxygen in gulps 
 And spit the metal directly back up the barrel 
 We ice grill the silhouettes (right) 
 The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero 
 My testament is striking B-Boy stances 
 Dancing past the foggy mirror 
 When wiped clean, the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit 
 I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm 
 Yeah, never swam up inside Summer Jam classic 
 Another bent backwards bastard 
 Scouring the carnival grounds for an outlet 
 Who the fuck is Aes Rock? 
 I'm not a name to keep at arms length 
 Adjacent to little Linus quilt makeshift 
 Sick security mechanism, check your mission 
 I am not a vision, check your mission 
 Just a simple sour patch delinquent 
 No it will not help you shove your Lincoln 
  
 [Hook] 
 I alone settle 
 I alone peddle in the mud 
 I alone, I condone rebel zone planting 
 I alone stand in a social coma 
 All up to your dome, follow I alone 
 I alone settle 
 I alone peddle in the mud 
 I alone, I condone rebel zone planting 
 I alone stand in a social coma 
 All up to your dome, follow I alone 
  
 [Method Man] 
 Now you see me, now you don't 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Well he was maverick enough, but still scraped up 
 Taki 183 innovation for the kids 
 Brick foot iron lung honor 
 Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber 
 Without a care, aside from posting the roster 
 Maladjusted blank-faced civilian dispersed feelings 
 Reeling in several separate defunct fame booster modules 
 This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient 
 See Aesop starving troopers in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins 
 (More like) 
 Like I'd auction off a fuck for that blind 'cause you ride in 
 I'd rather find the flaws and watch you hide 'em 
 Feel the haggard look penetrate brain castle 
 Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection 
 (Flash flooder!) 
 You're a fuckin' wind-up toy 
 A goddamn fourth string criminal trading card 
 The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits 
 To boost onlooker amusement after fading hard 
 Catch more Z's than Rip Van Winkle's 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar 
 Action! 
 We all compete the masked illusion 
 The common folk, I provoke 'em all 
 Challenge dirty balance 
 I elope with talent while they fidget 
 If the revolution ain't gon' be televised 
 Then fuck, I'll probably miss it 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I alone settle 
 I alone peddle in the mud 
 I alone, I condone rebel zone planting 
 I alone stand in a social coma 
 All up to your dome, follow I alone 
 I alone settle 
 I alone peddle in the mud 
 I alone, I condone rebel zone planting 
 I alone stand in a social coma 
 All up to your dome, follow I alone 
  
 [Outro] 
 Omega 1, where you at? 
 Talkin' that... 
  
 Saying lines about me 
 This guy over there, and her 
 If anybody says a bad thing, shut the mic 
 Shut them down 
 I'm the boss 
 Shut them down 
 That's all I gotta say[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops 
 High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth 
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance 
 Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands 
 And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch 
 So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore 
 I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns 
 So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn 
 (Pass the popcorn) Brawl fair, cop car 
 Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters 
 Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring 
 Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens 
 Packed to the very last rafter 
 Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage 
 Neck swivel with a chop chop volley 
 Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys 
 Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter 
 Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector 
 But never got his extra extra 
 Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining 
 So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven 
 Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up 
 Cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump 
 Know that... 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- popcorn, popcorn... 
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- capture the damage 
  
 (Yo, this dude talks real slow yo... Crazy 
 Yeah man that's my boy Steve; he just talks like that, it's weird 
 That is weird.) 
  
 [Verse 2: El-P] 
 Tune to "Hellemundo" for action packed blasphemy 
 Big city translate your face til it atrophy 
 I let the schadenfreude boy out actually 
 Deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly 
 (Yeah bitch) Pass the P's it's a laugh in 
 I can smell the tragedy when hatchin' 
 Happily dispassionately patched in 
 Alive with the menace of demise 
 Like, "Yes!" the pain dazzles men, pass the popcorn 
 (Pass the popcorn) It's reality at it's fastest 
 And yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses 
 I guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us 
 Wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous? 
 In the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically tilted fits 
 I adjust to climates of the wilderness 
 Walk along my spine take the pilgrimage 
 Up in to the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses 
 Work you motherfuckers (hooray!), there's all day to die 
 Innovate the mayhem with grace 
 The good-form-fall, fuck if I'mma warn y'all, nah 
 I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw 
 Sixty thousand watts of that raw 
 "Pull the claw out of the trunk" fun, each one teach one how to club one 
 Look at how they bathe up in the dove blood 
 It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud... 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn... 
 Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn... wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous? 
  
 (Yo honestly, if your man Steve really talks like that... uh, that's not really normal... 
 Yeah, that sucks... Yeah, it's pretty bad... 
 Nobody's voice should sound like that.) 
  
 [Verse 3: Aesop Rock] 
 It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace 
 It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained 
 It wasn't daisies and crazy 
 Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves 
 And saints, and every trainee face-painted while his great 
 Escape grazed and ate 
 He'll never make it, when he aims he shakes 
 And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door 
 With a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn 
 (Pass the popcorn) Clap clap, encore, monkey in the middle study 
 How the bunker took the missiles, age of machines with nary a green 
 Screen, so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems 
 I could tell the pet from the vet, money where his canine's spread 
 And never welched on a bet, that said, know the over-under 
 On your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow-maker's 
 Numbers every summer, bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release 'em? 
 Has he mercy, will he hack 'em to pieces? 
 Is he dirty, will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry? 
 And nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies 
 That hop around drunk in the land of a hundred Mondays 
 God damn, pop the Redenbacher proper and 
 For Christ's sake get this man a doctor![Hook] 
 I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel 
 Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle 
 I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle

 [Verse 1] 
 My kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak your secret 
 'bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why 
 His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns 
 And when the children met divinity I sat to watch the merge 
 It goes pandemonium live 
 Ya'll mutha fuckers stand up. Volunteer tantrums while your plan sunk, vivid 
 Play your sympathy card, son of misery classed with 
 The basket cases is in a classless matrix with elastic patience 
 I zig in a zagging only zone 
 Draggin a bag of lonely poem remnants 
 Short of breath like you're short of fresh 
 You're a portable mess 
 Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics, orphans 
 Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes 
 You're a spectacle 
 Pushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking 
 You touched the hand of God and I'm like 
 What are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man 
 By sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in 
 You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic 
 Like the king of the mountain requires a boost 
 I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at live bait clinics 
 For the thrill of 9 great mimics with 18 bloody lips, spittin 
 Beanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly 
 Walking uphill trying to get down 
 Prominent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness 
 When the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker 
 Servicing the greater half of nature 
 See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely 
 Warmingly piggy leader colony to comfort 
 Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured 
 Till he woke to find his tourniquet still functions

 Burn burn em mostly 
 Stuck unplucking plumage out the poultry 
 Soaking in bulk on a sofa with ductape upholstery 
 Dirty doc stellar space medic 
 Stoned by the commoners for glowing 
 Psuedo floaters buy them beats till bloated 
 Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion 
 Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter 
 You can sign your life after the fact 
 Wicked soldiers pickin with buddy system 
 Logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot 
 All in a days breath 
 I guess 
 Sandman here to foreshadow a day when television run over baboon heart transplants 
 Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps 
 With an iceman's chance in Dante's dreamland to stand where the fans lamp 
 But maybe I do 
 Yeah yeah maybe it's all over 
 Maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter 
 I mean absorbing attention's a must 
 You don't wanna be overlooked 
 Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much 
 One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats 
 And the angels who never hit bad notes when harmonizing 
 I'm an armor-plated farmer 
 I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow 
 For the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues 
 Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench 
 Either you drink it or sink it, coz there ain't no sitting on the fence 
 You make me chuckle child, it's Hell's kitchen now, miss 
 Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish

 Ugh, encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas 
 Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 You want to know why? Because I'm 
 Dead messengers buried in their Melvin shirts 
 Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher 
 Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain 
 Roll with grown men who still use code names 
 Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails 
 Might chase six legs through his oatmeal 
 Oh dear, no pets eat his own homework 
 Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs 
 Holmes, sick to the fishbone comb 
 My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone 
 It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong 
 Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws 
 Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor 
 Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker 
 She sells sea shells, he draws revenge 
 Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

 Live free, die fat 
 Rock shot to a kill screen time lapse 
 Watch how the blitzkrieg climax 
 Spring clean hijack, bring me my axe

 [Verse 2: Blueprint] 
 I'm laying in a cut overstuffed from a bad meal 
 Staring at the sun, on my back like a fat seal 
 Debating with myself about whether not rap's real 
 Cause broke motherfuckers are the only ones that have skill 
 Everybody got intentions that they can't reveal 
 Major label acts got to act like they don't have deals 
 Claiming grassroots, I'm like "hell no 
 Your buzz is as organic as Monsanto." 
 I'm going at your beanstalk, ax in hand 
 Over a beat bought Aes Rock, that's my man 
 People sleeping still believing that we haven't expanded 
 But that's just a small part of the master plan, bitch 
 Printnificent, shining 'till your skin chafe 
 Write until the pen ache, reclining by a big lake 
 I'm only winning cause I went in an gettin' waked 
 Chillin' at the crib by the time you get your shit straight

 You suppose robots would enjoy listening to music? 
 You figure that if robots are electronic creations they 
 Enjoy listening to electronic music 
 You think you can create a scientific symphony 
 We'd not only send to our metal friends but 
 Would also be fascinating to human ears 
 You already have, and it's on the other side of the record 
 I can't wait to hear it 
  
 [Verse 3: Rob Sonic] 
 MIDI with a drum change queue 
 Cherries in the mirror of his Mustang too 
 Took his thang from the South to the Rocklin Hooters 
 Bought her wings and a round, then he chopped and screwed her 
 Cops at the Getty so he thumbed his nose up 
 Pedal to the metal, leave them dunked in donuts 
 Stuck on "so what?" from the aged Tequila 
 When he drove into the back of an eighteen-wheeler 
 Basic leader, camp is cardboard 
 The jet chooses raps to advance their shark soar 
 Marked for M*A*S*H* out my cordial stingers 
 Address you crossly, corporal clinger 
 Attention all freaks with newer footing 
 My radio is not played by Cuba Gooding 
 Now, who's assuming that the man's a block boy 
 Cause he keep his fam happy with lots of Bok Choy

 Carbon heart buried his nozzle in fossil marker art

 Bastard polter gasps when the pigeon with Lazarus billy-goat whiskers 
 He roasted sea-salt in the open blisters

 Apply the details later and the clues will taper out 
 Unruley mayor souse, who piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth 
 Bazooka Tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors 
 Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers 
 Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever 
 Like Punxatawny Phil found with his four furry wrists severed 
 I walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church 
 With wild things that make Maurice Sendak question his early works 
 But no hostages, no promises 
 Out to clock corporate cogs and sprockets 
 Not clogs, all grommets 
 Running from a rabid ring-wraith click basilisk 
 Serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes 
 Scrub blood of the AF1s 52 Pick-up first degrees 
 Some toddlers smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries

 It makes homicide okie-dokie and your god will forgive you

 Twisty, fishy, contradicty, wild animal ship fleet 
 Off the sliding board dock of the Mr. Turtle pool mom bought 
 Somewhere they laminate dry bones in cool water and ease medulla 
 After you thumb suck and diaper change, get burped and shoot the school up 
 I'd duel too, but only to exploit no-brainers 
 Teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra-curricular flagpole scrapping

 Fragile maybe, you think?

 Wing of wax? Or wing of gold leaf? Choose one 
 Float or plummet 20,000 cold leagues 
 My nourishment's provided in the summer 
 So then I wonder how y'all chasing dreams when what's tangible still outruns you! 
 Hail dirty doll immaculate performance 
 Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I'm born in 
 Cut and paste alertness to current settings provided quick 
 Shimmy the pirate ship mass, spot the island, sound the siren 
 And about face 
 Let's salute the embraced pertinent generals 
 Who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles 
 Flirtin' with a serpent working overtime, drain the battery 
 Siphon the poison to flood his majesty's hatchery 
 I was riding on a yellow bus to where the brush thickens 
 And it ain't exactly plush pickings 
 I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge 
 I've ever crossed beneath the sun 
 Than live my life knowing you may one day follow me over one 
 Snake bite, breath too heavy to hold 
 Caught up in the wake of the red witch trying to swim it 
 Ran for the sake of dead cliques stripped of idyllic image 
 Steal a sloppy earth meal 
 Feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision 
 Thrill, trucking with a bucket of pennies 
 I'm 'a drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies 'til the cloud burst 
 Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap 
 Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap 
  
 [Hook] x2 
 In a city of garbage, trying to reap the harvest 
 Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest 
 Swing your little ax or be an oak tree if you can't 
 Either way; adapt to circumstance or play your final hand 
  
 You don't know enigma 
 An attempt to bury the hatchet rendered me victim of deviltry 
 Plus wounded like stigmatics 
 Something's huffing hazardous 
 I smell an inch of difference in this morning's pollution pistons 
 And how the loose ends drifted 
 My sour patch institution slipped in amidst the invaders and pardon my tone 
 But this garden's grown fucking acres since my visit 
 Itching to count the layers in the blizzard 
 'Til that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and twists it 
 It's a carnival 
 Have you any sweets for my weary kin? It's a carnival 
 Have you any feed for my cheery grin? It's a carnival 
 Welcome, play our games, you'll never win 
 'Cuz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend 
 And I'm a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas 
 Anti-freeze to glacier, cookin' a look of fiery nature 
 It's the ceiling feeling too heavy to bliss the I-beams for a fraction more 
 Collapsed and left 'I'm sorry' tacked to you door 
 Pitching my back to hell's kitchen 
 Back burner murder machinery released regardless of the pardons 
 Hitching my life to the leash of one minstrel 
 Sick of same window different visual 
 Same agnostic hostage different ritual 
 Plague, cooperative super colony clash 
 I heard you got a dust collection, lemme see it 
 I duel as underdog vs. forced adaptation to the marvels of the now 
 Since then, my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground

 Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars 
  
 Piety for the fam, embargo piggybackers 
 Navigate sim-city backwards

 Zephyrs less detrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews 
 Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose 
 If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner 
 It's Bodycast the Pilates class 
 Rumble in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smash 
 Drag them prophecies 
 Be them celestine or Mothman to the bumper boat monster mash 
 You see the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn 
 Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn 
 One champ put in long hours like Tim Leary's lava lamps 
 Just to be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands 
 Isolated, biological phenomenon 
 Verse nocturnally orchestrated car alarms 
 Y'all sketch portraits of your neighbors, tack 'em up without fail 
 See a row of red pitchforks and bifurcated tails 
 Official Max Fischer-Blume brake cable clipper (Def)

 As an appleseed aborted resorts to Bazooka Tooth shit

 A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse 
 Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls

 Okay the rotary corner grow to be notably mobile 
 And social gopher teeth form holes 
 Or any scene where Brie is normal 
 We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole 
 When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell 
  
 [Verse 5: Rob Sonic] 
 Burning it at both ends, friends let's commiserate 
 Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make 
 Born at the baddest sign, half this time, still awake 
 Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights

 All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold

 Watch them collide and explode

 When I peel the blinds back, up jump the irons call 
 Monkey wrench in my hands, razor cut the islands off 
 Homemade taps-memories, I ignore the private calls 
 And ever since the 80's, I think something's in my Tylenols 
  
 [Verse 8: Aesop Rock] 
 What plague? Make an idolant brigade 
 So eager to walk planks, they will climb a tree and wait 
 Their irony is waning over piety and faith 
 So when the ghostly ruminations come, we'll kindly disobey it 
 I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint 
 To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks 
 Can't hold howls in corrals with a key 
 So will the worms please shriek on the count of three 
 (THREE!) 
  
 [Verse 9: Rob Sonic] 
 If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep 
 I could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace 
 No more would my president come off as a crooked thief 
 And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me 
  
 [Verse 10: Aesop Rock] 
 Sideways eye on a sinister boundary 
 Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly 
 99 models of fear on the wall timorous 
 Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks 
  
 [Hook] 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons 
  
 Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food 
 Riff Raff (?) with (?) wolves 
 Land sharks know to take money, money, lose 
 Dark Heart News! AHH! 
  
 (Scratched) 
 Extra, extra, read all about me 
 At the bottom of our news tonight[Slug] 
 Burn it down... 
 Pad the circles 'round your life 
 To capture all the sides you sight 
 Magic tricks where skeptics sink 
 The ice is thin, stay off the lake 
 Waiting for a clock to punch 
 Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch 
 If I stop to count the leaves on only one of these here trees 
 Not sure that I know what's pure 
 Born to kill the insecure 
 Some respect, some resent, some remain from start to end 
 Wear my heart on my short sleeves 
 I'm stuck out here, I lost my keys 
 From the roof I watch the street 
 And pray for those that's caught beneath 
  
 [Hook--Slug and Aesop] 2x 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
  
 [Slug] 
 I dunno what I have left 
 To give other than truth and breath 
 Angel when she shuts her eyes 
 Like we will leave to my demise 
 Between my time is short 
 About to start my last resort 
 Wake me up when it's time to make babies 
 Talkin planet earthquakes 
 Tied the laces, touch the ground 
 Let emotions ruptured now 
 As long as I know right from wrong, I'll be ok I'll sing my songs 
  
 Chorus 4x 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I wanna lift every yellowbrick 
 I've never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness 
 At least not to you and yours 
 Maybe just my friends and fellowships 
 As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development 
 I swear they'll understand!!! 
 There's a storm outside my tenement 
 Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline 
 I guess that's why my homie Blockhead stays glued to the television 
 Now I look less intelligent 
 Cuz I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost 
 Well it's warm by the filament 
 Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives 
 Stories, laughs, black coffee and honest-to-God sentiment 
 Cocooned inside the unified efforts to all get settled in 
 Away from where the rain pours! 
 Well count your delegates 
 Weed out the bums who practice migration other than elegant 
 Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate 
 But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness 
 And fall to rock bottom 
 Spot 'em with their carelessness 
 The urge could burst to turn even those pacifist to militant 
 You can't even have half of free second 
 To become jealous in 
 You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran 
 Buried in merit badges 
 I'm stuck in the center and could care less 
 About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements 
 I got a defense that I call coolin' with my brethren 
 Sometimes I get wet 
 But it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree? 
  
 Chorus 4x 
  
 [Aesop Rock] *repeat to fade* 
 If you wanna push 
 Then I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushin' 
 Then why did you ask me to push?[Verse 1: Breeze Brewin] 
 Ayo, ayo, I send this to all of my corporate corpses 
 Tryna abort the thoughts of comin' out wildin' 
 Dumbin' out time to off the office 
 I was surely sorta twisted 
 Worked at a TV studio, an audio assistant 
 Easy, do my duty, though at times was in a mean mood 
 Hot, I gotta be cool 
 I was on the brink of fiend's drool 
 Glaring at the green room 
 Made a brother the same color, but beyond neon 
 Pushin' me to peon, barkin' at dreams to be gone 
 Tending to the talent and many, they haven't any 
 Was especially a challenge when he be like 
 Goddamnit, can he hear his vocal? 
 As he cuffin' it, "How my mic sound?" 
 Thinkin', on the low, it's perfect when he put the mic down 
 Clown stand steady grillin', wanting subservience 
 Sound man buryin', thinkin' I'd fuckin' murder them 
 And steamin' as I'm watchin' duke 
 Leavin' on some hot pursuit 
 Gotta win, as these cats be modelin' what not to do 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock] 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car) 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car) 
  
 Six in the morning and the walls close in 
 High noon calls and the walls own him 
 Kings at the ready know the walls won't win 
  
 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore (Right) 
 Gore is my harbinger, pardon The Art of War (Right) 
 Get your doors darkened 
 By the house of card carpenters 
 Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus and more 
 Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores 
 Who take important conference calls in corner office walls 
 Still, a buck is a buck and he punch numbers 
 Five - punch 
 Just say no to company functions 
 And he duck into the dungeons 
 Nothing says "Kill it" like a day of fetching 
 Paper clips and staplers for the privileged 
 Two lives, one is chores for whores 
 One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours 
 And I poured in with a large coffee 
 Tardy every morning 
 To a man who took authority beyond what it was for 
 How you gonna pay the rent day-job-free? 
 Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock] 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car) 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car) 
  
 Six in the morning and the walls close in 
 High noon calls and the walls own him 
 Kings at the ready know the walls won't win 
  
 [Verse 3: Cage] 
 In a hospital gown, day off from being tied down in recreation 
 Swinging a paddle at mental patients 
 Raping the competition to smother the pain and sin 
 So he pound you out in table tennis like Wang Liqin 
 Too strange within just to stop 
 Demented interactions sleep and thoughts documented 
 He's lingering insane paint thinner in his vein 
 Colors blown out around the doctor's finger in his brain 
 With a needle unable to beat him in a fetal position 
 He crafted a path to escape his condition 
 Would cling to the white walls of psych halls 
 In his mind soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time 
 But not before more injections strapped to the bed 
 Till the psychotropics took hold of the rap in his head 
 When his wrists released, he wrote tunes you could snoop through 
 Day of release said, "Depart from me, I never knew you" 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock] 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car) 
 In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car) 
 In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car) 
  
 Six in the morning and the walls close in 
 High noon calls and the walls own him 
 Kings at the ready know the walls won't win 
  
 [Vocal sample] 
 "I-I-I'm leavin'"Blazin' with a facemelter 
 Go fish 
 Pigeon, itching for a pit to put the pig in 
 Scalped, bottom feeder, nose bleeder, cheap seats 
 To the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks 
 What up? 
 Grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture 
 Stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma 
 The latch key degree was obtained in the savage years 
 Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears 
 Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet 
 Had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh 
 When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin 
 For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes 
 And I'm high on ion jitters, call it a prime directive of the damned 
 Who grew to sleep easy to white noise 
 The humming of the machinery running towards them crawl 
 Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall 
 The little short circuit with the still born vibe 
 Till the villagers circled and determined "it is alive" 
 Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny 
 Like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?" 
 I piss clumsy with electrode head pan (sorry) 
 Pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan 
 Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!) 
 Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!) 
 At some point early when drunk on electric kisses 
 I'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage (sign this) 
 The pain came on a makeshift main stage 
 And sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate 
 For that I made a game play, reborn torn 
 At the ministry of information trying to get informed 
 They'll duck it out and I will cease all wars 
 So if you babysit a caroline be fore warned 
 I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar 
 Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate 
 Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped 
 Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept 
 Smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadgets 
 With battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers 
 While you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children 
 I was sharking classes with taggers for television (Click!) 
 Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered 
 Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage 
 To boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor 
 Blades clipped the perfect petal now play later 
 Play never, if escaped raped treasure 
 That's a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether 
 Or even yesteryear scrapes fester, administer gauze 
 But cauterized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause 
 King of applause (yay!) beats the garbage flood for ten(?) 
 Porn king of New York, alley punk perv scum 
 Waddle on the voyage of the voyeur 
 Six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick 
 I am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven 
 Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon 
 Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up 
 With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck 
 Cool green over the frame under the clothes line 
 Whose crew choose fuel most, mine 
 Holy trinity, triple six, triple x, city barrack 
 Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it 
 He da: 
 Built hideous,silk of the milk litigant, silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish 
 Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity 
 As your industry bitch? NO 
 Final answer, track the moniker 
 To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica 
 Dirty old man no tea cup thirst, peak up skirts 
 For slaps from that d-cup nurse 
 Cackle his old gums lewd (lewd), crass 
 Show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has 
 She like THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING 
 They don't call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK 
 Now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro 
 Half mast the flag pole 
 Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms 
 I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms 
 Generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion 
 Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture 
 Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter 
 Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit 
 So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other 
 I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject 
 So when the disc changer goes from guns to space 
 It is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public 
 But fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right? 
 He's trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight) 
 Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons 
 Can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references? 
 (WOW) yeah but why try, I'm so groggy 
 The mach nine Ballentine ain't for everybody 
 But I will say this to y'all that used your fifteen of fame 
 To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane 
 And that's a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,(here) 
 Who the fouler howler (me) who the rabble rouser 
 What the happy hour starved the Peruvian aggy powder,(tight) 
 Trade up at the digital Jesus factory outlet (bout it, bout it) 
 Bout it bout it, fuck a fork tongue cutlery, the fuckery is famous 
 Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers 
 Held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature 
 Robot wars, machines hit the floor 
 And the simians syncopated a gigantic "encore" 
 Alright I'm bored, five minute bag of tricks 
 If you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks 
  
 ONE[Verse 1] 
 The first step is a doozy, it’s roulette with a mood ring 
 The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak 
 A permanent post-game is littered with bridge trolls 
 Skirting the copay, divvy the death toll 
 Innumerable codenames, alerted and mobile 
 Familiar rising, and furnacing cold piles 
 Resilient style kings, impossibly tantrum 
 Wandering wild things, obelisk phantoms 
 On linoleum or lava, leaders of a leadfoot fauna 
 His left source blunt force trauma 
 Not pillar of the commune, a splinter off the pagan 
 Who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation 
 From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids 
 By the beautiful and cryogenic stasis 
 Sadists, meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot 
 Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock 
 Are shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially 
 Homie, no myth flowers grow where he piss 
 And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon 
 To shrink into the sunset bumping Pachelbel's Canon 
 In D motherfucker, the author of the artistry 
 May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy 
  
 Hello. Hello? Shit 
  
 [Hook] 
 Too geeked up to even keep it down 
 Too peaced out to even be around 
 Too beat up to even breathe it out 
 (Too freaked out to even leave your house) x5 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 You wish you could dance more, I wish you would talk less 
 My gentleman transformed, to bringers of offed heads 
 Moments of land war, my Lazarus species 
 Tattered and bruised up, from back in the cheap seats 
 Hackers on crew cuts, foam at the mush mouth 
 Gag at the news truck, notably unsound 
 Dragging his clown shoes, food in his moustache 
 Raggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass 
 I’m good, house at the beach of expelled hubcaps 
 Black lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft 
 Bad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper 
 Of kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas 
 And underdogs with posters of a front-side Tony Alva 
 On the sticker laden walls above their uncle’s Bowie albums 
 Graduate to flyers of an execrated sigil 
 And live to see another sexy generation fizzle 
 Out, keep rap homely 
 Bear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee 
 Fat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow’s feet 
 Rat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, go team 
 I walk with Hawaii on a greenscreen behind me 
 So even the awkward pauses feel inviting 
 Standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out 
 Can’t talk now too freaked out 
  
 [Hook][Hook] 
 No more pencils, no more books 
 I built the city out one brick 
 It had a mayor and a crook 
 I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt 
 I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Every tenderfoot cadet bettered slit-throat percentages 
 Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman) 
 I arrange panoramics of a placid cataloguing where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring 
 I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes 
 And she'll bring the cadavers set 'em free and let 'em feed 
 The deviltry penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm clock 
 Silly Billy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops 
 And I'm a warden 
 My tongue is full of glass 
 Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle 
 If he truly drank the poison 
 I'm alienating the mating dance of the higher, ire-based, tired-faced, miser-made God clones 
 We can manufacture medicine 
 Patent the five digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector) 
 My destinies resting with red worms chewin' off the carcass anyway 
 Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray 
 By the way if that diamond ring don't shine 
 That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment 
 I'll pedal my tricycle through the F-5 logistics of a twister 
 Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 If I botched the operation I apologize (Sorry) 
 The err's rooted in carbon 
 I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets 
 I'm fresh out of Gepetto's woodwork asylum 
 See the frame, wire-bound knuckles 
 Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle 
 Now when a page becomes a squire, be engaged, clap your wings 
 When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony 
 But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker 
 And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (Glory hunter) 
 Is it genuine enough to feel, baby felon? 
 Negotiate comradery or wilt 
 My dismal little little loom 
 Purged urgent with dirty dominion monitor boxes 
 Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins 
 (Now) You ain't excused from table side 
 Till the dinner plate's spotless 
 Slurping' liquid happy citizen enhancer 
 I got this slicky sycamore handshake 
 That mimics digit splinter entry 
 Thereby filtering citizens tin man prior to axe descending (Tight) 
 Cats know the ambiance, calm beyond comparison 
 Captain passive spring loaded serenity 
 I'm trying to give this city acupuncture 
 Shovin' one-way pins in subway systems 
 Standing up where I'm landing', now that a runway victim (Push, push) 
 Nature's gone batty, spreading spore legitimate 
 Slice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship 
 See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it 
 Cause it spreads the jinx upon a sleeping cynic 
  
 [Hook] 
 No more pencils, no more books 
 I built the city out one brick 
 I had a mayor and a crook 
 I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt 
 I stole the brick back and-- 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems 
 From one overlooked scene including loopholes 
 When Christ studies the return ramifications 
 I'll burn the campus to impress him 
 Then rock like Medusa glances 
 Who ran the final mile before the blanks blown? 
 Home alone sipping beetle juice 
 Just to numb it, then shimmy the needles loose 
 I built a castle out of fifty-two cards 
 Plus jokers, wit, and image 
 Modern theory charges while remaining harnessed to the vintage 
 I'm valid hypothesis honoring Occam's Razor 
 With a seam sewn via fatigued knuckle work (Labor) 
 I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed 
 In case Tommy Turbulence located The Matrix that impedes 
 Whistle me a dirge, falcon boogie burst classic 
 Bastard repellent fell in haunted machines screened by similars 
 Got beckoned like a suicide king to the dagger surface 
 Due to one queen who lodged her faith inside a broken circus 
 Me and my stargazers from the woodwork serve the furnace 
 Omit the discoloring on the lung then stung the serpents 
 I cherish the Ferris wheel's revolutions 
 It's not because the ride enthralls 
 More simply to the fact that it still revolves 
 Nursed in a bracket of televis, plastics and saccharin (well) 
 I oppose mass panic 
 Thoroughbred fantasy cadets pose with a latch key demeanor 
 Returning to find a home vacant with no similars to compare days with 
 Let's build![Verse One] 
 I saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret 
 Slid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I 
 My ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves 
 Where vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids 
 Mirrored without a slapstick 
 Mavericks plugged directly to third rail surges 
 Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits 
 Oooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak 
 Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak 
 Infected projection hung thick in the air 
 Pungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes 
 Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers 
 And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god 
 Sweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes 
 Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave 
 All fail the most serene communication pageant 
 Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges 
 I spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage 
 And serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin 
 Buried in leagues a "'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me' 
 'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not 
 Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath 
 Naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it 
 Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream 
 Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions 
  
 [Hook] 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours 
 For kicking your fantasies overboard 
 I mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
  
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs 
 For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs 
 I mean I´m only one servant, making one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 You ever died a thousand deaths?, I have 
 And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed 
 And made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma 
 Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I 
 Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems 
 Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries 
 Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury 
 Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me 
 Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta 
 Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine 
 Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues 
 And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall 
 Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards 
 Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward 
 Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers 
 My wing span can and will employ full expansion 
 Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold 
 Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes 
 All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches 
 Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear 
 Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard 
 And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't 
 Bundled in my humble little plummet 
 Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick 
  
 [Hook x2]March 
 The more the merrier 
 Get a couple or more to carry you to the burial 
 F-R-E-S-H 
 Fresh to death and keep it def to the left 
 Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius 
 (Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius 
 (Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus 
 Let 'em die for it 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Delicate freak show alert the frame 
 Bash all flags where the mag spin park 
 Corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein 
 Boogie down kits to slip past the guard 
 Def with a mascot of radical mass 
 Megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz 
 We are not trained to divert the crash 
 But march face first with a prayer for the blitz 
 Stand up for the cinema fire, simian ire 
 Cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky; 
 Intimate eyes loop all known alleys 
 Scoop the bounty like daddy hires Bazooka to murder Ralphie 
 I curdle with burnt milk, pariah sigh, honor piranha money 
 Count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper-tummy 
 One of these rebels could level the marked city 
 But the N.Y. uber alles governor's picky 
 I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with 
 Ultra, soldier poach the folklore 
 Jump guns through the ninth gate 
 Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace 
 Even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage 
 Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age 
 We bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot 
 Plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox 
 Wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop 
 Boy meets vermin: the widescreen version 
 Headaches, nausea, vomiting, facial paralysis 
 These are a few of my favorite venomous side effects 
 Mamba, Water Moc, Pit Viper, Diamond Back 
 Anaconda, Boomslang, Cobra, bite 'em back 
 Spinal tap crabs to the clapper 
 Aesop Rock is the Cadillac of natural disaster 
 Push that button 
 Everybody gotta push something 
 That's why the envelope is where it wasn't 
 I work with the builders, whittle my gorilla military 
 And fizzle 'em through the vigilante filters 
 Who lamps left of the toggle? 
 How'd they fit that ninja in a bottle? 
 Done a hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out 
 Versus a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down 
  
 Get up (get down) 
 Sit up (sit down) 
 It's either fancy footwork (or get bit by the hounds) 
 Face up (face down) 
 Laced up (laced down) 
 It's either fist to the sky (or get bit by the crowd) 
 Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius 
 (Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius 
 (Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus 
 Let 'em die for it 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day 
 When the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers 
 Would have said 'curb it' like any nervous habit 
 'til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres 
 And labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters 
 Oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers 
 Fuck it 
 Want a carnivore war? Bet 
 I'll be at the Bronx Zoo with a lock pick kit 
 On the eject for cockpit bench, helicop clip 
 Nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit 
 Roger, hop-fence-kill-a-crop, monster 
 We are the tired and poor, we come for your water 
 Boom! 
 Bounce when the church corrupt 
 When the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs 
 When the stars finger babies like I flirt with sluts 
 You'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up 
 Metal kettle unsettling treble howl, settler trembling 
 Measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine 
 Never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper 
 'til it's pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after 
 And U.S.A. on a Ketamine disaster 
 Cane for stress 
 Crack if the former left you unimpressed 
 Now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball, but damn 
 Kumba-fucking-ya, dog 
 Terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought 
 Prepped package of the slickest spin-doctors 
 Raised where the paranoid hide tools proper 
 Like suspicious cargo in a high school locker 
 And it looks like war, quacks like war 
 So it's Occam's Razor and I'm swayze out the door 
 A hundred million motherfuckers hold me back 
 The hand cannons won't ask 'bout your zodiac, boy 
  
 Get up (get down) 
 Sit up (sit down) 
 It's either fancy footwork (or get bit by the hounds) 
 Face up (face down) 
 Laced up (laced down) 
 It's either fist to the sky (or get bit by the crowd) 
 Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius 
 (Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius 
 (Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus 
 Let 'em die for it"Fuck me!" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull 
 Food, clothes, medicinal 
 Variety, for every plastic orange bottle 
 The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets 
 Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths 
 For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think 
 Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get 
 When bourgie hopes hellions 
 Food, clothes, medicine, alumni 
 Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar 
 Let's bet it melts together 
 Let's get these men some shelter 
 Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes 
 On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff) 
 It's a bath house for brave soldiers 
 When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing 
 Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box 
 Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager 
 Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee 
 Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me 
 Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents 
 Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine 
 United we stand to all our parties click 
 I divide and conquer cause frankly I'd rather sit 
 We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces 
 Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers 
 Now Major Aes route the following order 
 To all his crew's chromed generals 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
  
 [Hook] 
 Walk on glass, bang on doors 
 Talk all trash, hang on whores 
 Walk on cash, bank on wars 
 Like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours 
 It's yours, it's yours, it's yours 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 We rotate protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger, 90 moves choked citizens 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 Well y'at's a quick example accept as commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent 
 Food, clothes, medicine 
 It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin 
 ... 
 I'll bite the hand that feeds 
 Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back 
 Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck 
 Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium 
 With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom 
 Save me some, scallywags hold your breath 
 The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death 
 Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch 
 Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip 
 I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era 
 Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters 
 Through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin' cliff's notes vendors 
 Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better 
 These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts 
 Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicate 
 Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards 
 In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it 
 Zinger! 
 Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup 
 Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks 
 Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up! 
 Food, clothes, medicine, cause hungry, naked, sick, sucks! 
 Collide your worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance 
 And curb them herbie love bug by the cursive final curtain clamp 
 Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth 
 I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out 
  
 [Hook]Television, all hail grand pixelated god of 
 Fantasy, murder scape bent perspective 
 Fuck a sore channel changed digit 
 I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan 
 With a stable diet of my cable pirate 
 Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on 
 Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home 
 Lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy 
 Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team 
 Ooh, I love all advertisements 
 Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute 
 Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad 
 Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie 
 Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit 
 Now, twenty first century plagued 
 Dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients 
 Telecast patrons 
 Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine 
 With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream 
 And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor 
 Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator 
 I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret 
 Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis 
 My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation 
 Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station 
 Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal 
 And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch 
 Lights out, I ain't ever gonna have to leave my house 
 Satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant 
 Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great 
 Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks 
 If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind 
 And that's fine, and that's fine... 
  
 Make me a star, I wanna touch gold 
 Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen 
 Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster 
 Crucify my little future to the monitor 
 Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in 
 Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function 
 But the children seem to love it 
 Yes mother, me and wild discovery 
 And heard the static flock to where I sleep 
 By the glow of that magic box big speaker 
 Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling 
 Tangled in the star spangled wiring 
 I can turn from toxicated visuals 
 And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty 
 Fuck the fortress 
 Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head 
 I'll be dead by morning anyway 
 Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets 
 To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship 
 I want commercials twenty four-seven 
 I wanna shop from my bed and set an 
 Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren 
 I bond with a six stringed correspondence 
 And lurking circuitry circus 
 With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface 
 Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts 
 Channel zero addict, immaculate 
 It goes- big screen, little screen, any screen'll do 
 Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze 
 Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze 
 I wanna see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance 
 So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, silent flicks better than nothing 
 Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist 
 The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest 
 Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something? 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon 
 Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom 
 It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention 
 But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences 
  
 Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me 
 Your majesty, I love you, I despise you 
 My everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization 
 Come along with me, my friend for the most glorious sensation[Intro: Vast Aire & Aesop conversing] 
 Yo, (Alright Ok) 
 Can I get a quarter or something? 
 Little hungry, you know what I'm saying? (Alright Ok) 
 Homeless... 
 I need a loosey, yo... 
 (Yo...) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels 
 And a city full of horns, jackhammers, and rape whistles 
 The alley cats manipulate the blocks with gutter magic 
 Today my heart beats only out of habit 
 Check it, it's like.. 
 My man Jus used to keep an ox between his teeth 
 Said he could spit it with pinpoint accuracy if there was beef 
 We chuckled out loud 
 Still the thought of it intrigued me, (right) 
 So now I keep a jackal under my tongue to spit with related reasoning 
 The earthworm turbulent murder burnout Gerber baby no-brainer memoir stardom 
 Alarmed, pardon the old buzz deader 
 Robert Crumb ugly dumb image 
 Barely sprung fairly numb grimace 
 Nearly cut cherry blood spicket wrists back in high school (now it's like) 
 Slide, with a millipede pedagogue pirate 
 Navigates city sump systems, urbanite turbines, twisted Pistons, Termites that infect sturdy grillage 
 There's roaches in the pillars, spillover 
 And crawl across commuter-clean wingtips and loafers 
 It's the theme park I built 
 Pocket full of nickels for cigarettes, gum, and milk 
 Bitterness, love, and violence 
 I'm writing a petition to have smoking as a sport 
 In the 2002 Summer Olympic Games (wanna sign it?) 
 Now look, I jux germs draggin a gavel knee deep in a maggot hatchery 
 Operation capture flag by any means 
 If this means anything at all, anyway it's a riddle 
 Walking to the store with a pocket full of nickels 
  
 [Segue 1: Vast Aire & Aesop Conversing] 
 Ay uh, yo excuse me (Ay Yo) yo 
 Can I borrow a dollar or something? (Ah sorry man) Nickel? 
 (Sorry man, I can't help you out dog) Quarter? 
 Something, man? (Yeah I only got enough for like cigarettes and shit man) 
 Alright man, I see how it is. (I'm straight) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels 
 And a city full of World Trade Center victim candle vigils 
 There's anthrax in our mailboxes and Xanax in my tummy 
 There's a single Spanish female out west traveling the country 
 Freak of Fantasia leak laser major. Running bases 
 Neighborhood watch weasels pace in ugly acres more than often 
 If I ever make it big, I'm gonna build a skyscraper 
 Tall enough to piss on Cloud 9 egos from my corner office 
 You can't pull the plug on a catapult (nope) 
 I toss a nickel to a bum's cup from twenty paces thumbs up 
 Got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up 
 Nineteen of 'em are 24 bars long, the other one goes (SHUT THE FUCK UP!) 
 Animatronic daddy long legs stay grimy up in your zoning wall, gobbling villagers trying to hide behind the windmill 
 I joust riding pig-back through subway tunnels with a third rail lance 
 While most still try to penetrate the alligator glance (It goes) 
 Back of the class, throwing pencils at professors 
 It made the Barbarellas giggle 
 That's when life's pleasures were simple 
 Now it takes a dancing bear jumping through flaming hoops 
 To even make em buy the god-forsaken single! 
 Thou shalt not desecrate the soothing spiral 
 Offered by a classic cut to vinyl 
 Find that in the Bible! 
 Miter saw militia fix ya up 
 How bout a pyramid shaped torso 
 With your hollow numbskull balancing on top 
 Now if you gotta rock a gas mask outside of your own apartment 
 You could pretty safely quote Shamar 
 Life's Ill, sometimes Life might kill, sometimes prayers dwindle 
 Walking to the store with a pocket full of nickels 
  
 [Segue 2: Vast Aire & Aesop Conversing] 
 Yo (ay what's up man?) Yo can I ohh... 
 No.. Never mind, man. (I can't help you out man) 
 Asshole! (Yo man, I'm trying to help myself out right now) 
 Fucking asked you for a loosey and you turned me down. (Dog, I'm sorry dog!) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Walk into the store, same pocket, same nickels 
 In a city where every crack in the sidewalk's a symbol 
 Where there's crack in the basement, where there's krakens and slave ships 
 Where there's crack whores and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases 
 My boombox runs on a baboon heart transplant (This is hell!) 
 I got a poltergeist on a leash trained by Carroll Ann herself 
 Two Thousand something... 
 When technology ate itself glutton 
 Every move I make's from a robot gepetto pressing a red button 
 It's Vietnam in the fumes... 
 So I run with cannibals that bite the hand that feeds cuz it tastes better than the food 
 The prickly outer shell's genetic, it helps defense mode 
 But it also helped to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships 
 Watch a six legged insect crawl out of the billy goat beard 
 Watch a sick makeshift bitch threat fall out when the filthy smoke clears 
 Watch the insect's stinger sting threat till it has sweat a bullet 
 Sweat a full clip, sweat a river, dead the bullshit, sail away and wither 
 You're the kind of cat that rolls a pimped out Caddy 
 Dropped with rims and limousine tints bumpin Enya 
 Insert laughter here 
 I wanna rap a lot and stack cheddar by the fistful 
 But for now, I walk into the store with a pocket full of huhh... 
  
 [Outro: Vast Aire & Aesop conversing] 
 Excuse me, man. (alright ok) 
 Can I... Can I borrow a dollar or something to eat? 
 (alright ok) I'm... I'm hungry 
 I'm saying yo... (alright ok) (Look at that..) 
 I'm homeless, man. (Look at that bum) (alright ok) 
 I fought for this country, man. (yeah) 
 Sleep on park benches... starvin' 
 All I need is like a loosey and like a sandwich or somethin', man.. 
 Wiping my ass with the Daily News man... c'mon man... 
 Sleepin' with squirrels... (Oh my god, What are you doing with that squirrel?)[Verse 1: Blueprint] 
 I spit with an immense amount of power 
 Sparks flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our 
 Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours 
 Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note 
 Ripping a crab's throat, for spitting a bad quote 
 (Blueprint what's your approach?) 
 I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics 
 And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic 
 I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again 
 Fuck around and forget just how whack it's been 
 I'm a bad man (Why's that?) 
 I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas 
 And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders 
 And play David Blaine on any chains that hold us 
 What started out as food for thought 
 Turned into thoughts to turnin' crews into food in hopes to satisfy my 
 Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms, small planets and satellites 
 Your solar system is my condiment; 
 I vomit comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense 
 Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming 
 So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydrant 
 Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired; 
 Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired 
 But before you, get a reason to ever diss us 
 I'll drop an ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer 
 But this is, the building block of all that is 
 And what it is, is Alchemy 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock & Blueprint] 
 Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder 
 Alchemy, we made this to take your style under 
 Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp, tight grip 
 Determined not to let time slip 
 This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all its glory 
 Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story 
 Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp; tight grip 
 Determined not to let time slip 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 (Ah) Dirty (dirty) destiny; 
 Burden murders with a burnt version of peasantry 
 Nervous clerks flirtin' with hurly burly chemistry 
 Graffiti burner urchin merging with a certain herd to jerk and serve your centerpiece 
 My zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline bound and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up (I'll tell you what) 
 Born style in 4 dimensions count 'em: 
 Three to take 'em to ya muck, one to build a world you'll never touch and I'm a pilot 
 Delirium, serum, poison arrangement 
 Come browse through an idyllic storm and suck the raw enslavement 
 With a grim-style stinger creeping out the basement 
 Encased in wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence 
 For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist up shielding mother nature 
 From a fatal wrist cut, story, I respect you 
 (So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?) 
 Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms 
 Breathe even or lean squeamish, grip milestone like ring ring ring I just called to scream phoenix click dial tone 
 Welcome to a cloud 12 brutal hallucination war pillar 
 Carnivore, carnival, karma slasher 
 I dash like a jackrabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce 
 To Edward Scissorhands your string of doubts and turn it out 
 This is that Mighty Casey homefield advantage to bend your blizzard 
 With a crocodile smile and five robot knuckles to your kisser 
 This is 
  
 [Chorus: Aesop Rock & Blueprint] 
 Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder 
 Alchemy, we made this to take your style under 
 Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp, tight grip 
 Determined not to let time slip 
 This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all its glory 
 Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story 
 Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp; tight grip 
 Determined not to let time slip[Verse 1] 
 Raw, I'mma give it to ya, no trivia 
 Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted bliss militia 
 A bent funny bone, drone community 
 Spit a thousand and one ripples to cripple the continuity 
 Tapwater builds character. Right 
 I irrigate it straight to mainline 
 You want to do the same? Fine 
 These pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain 
 Behold "Old King Credible". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off 
 Where every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers 
 One sixth buckle 
 Five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle 
 But I'll get you (I'mma get at you) 
 My novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land 
 But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well 
 Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid 
 I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, "I didn't do it" 
 God, is it on? Is it beyond basic? 
 Does it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless? 
 Does it have a title? If it didn't would you name it? 
 Does it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist? 
 We could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour 
 Until each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics 
 Swerve around the cobra kisses 
 See if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it 
 Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in 
 Serves you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits 
 I'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string 
 Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down 
  
 [Hook] 
 It goes boom boom boom (x4) 
 Boombox (x4) 
 C'mon 
  
 [Sample: C-Rayz Walz] 
 I originate with the drums 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Earth to A.R. vertical 
 Burden has increased at an alarming rate 
 Bliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling 
 Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional 
 Ease back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10 
 Let the back burner boiling point descend 
 I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal) 
 Strike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace 
 Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild 
 In five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets 
 Want to be a fighter pilot? 
 Driving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil 
 Sitting sweating bullets on a console 
 Busting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo 
 Dead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note 
 Schooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow 
 See contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance 
 Without an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans 
 Combing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand 
 And truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap 
 See I convince myself it's on, therefore it is 
 And the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids 
 I tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care 
 That's when they all threw their hands in the air 
  
 [Hook][Verse 1] 
 6AM and I’m dyin' for breakfast 
 Yawn and stretch then I’m diving for shellfish 
 Back up at the surface in a second or three 
 With a trophy Abalone from the depths of the sea 
 Water front critters in a symphony of sniggers 
 That’s a pretty big meal for a pretty little dipper 
 How you gonna carry home all that food 
 I’ma kick back slow and point my toes at the moon 
 Cause 
  
 [Hook] 
 My Belly is a table 
 My Belly is a table 
 When I’m laying on my back 
 Snack plate upon my navel 
 Escargot, crab salad on a bagel 
 My Belly is a table 
 Say, say say what!? 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 6PM clam diggin all day 
 Big fat Belly like the grand buffet 
 You bobbin with the best back stroke on the river 
 Potlucks stretch from his throat to his liver 
 I’m never late for dinner, I make no reservations 
 All I do is pirouette into a den of celebration 
 With a delicate maneuver truth be told 
 My otter pop used to call it the sushi roll 
 You see... 
  
 [Hook] 
 My Belly is a table 
 My Belly is a table 
 When I’m laying on my back 
 Snack plate upon my navel 
 Crawdad, cocktail, prawns, basil 
 My Belly is a table 
 Say, say say what!? 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Shhh shhhh who’s making all that noise! 
 We’re trying to sleep! 
 I’m trying to sleep over here! 
 Me too, me too, me too 
 Me too, me too, me too 
 Who’s that? 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Twelve o’clock midnight quiet on a beach 
 Not a creature is stirring they’re defiantly asleep 
 All except one, eyes peeking at the shore 
 Mind on his stomach and his stomach on more 
 Slip in to the water where he nestled with the bottom 
 If he wrestle with the mussel he will render it forgotten 
 Rise with the take found lights in his face 
 And the whole wide lake lights like surprise we’re awake! 
 [Surprise yayyyy!!] 
 I hope he caught more than one! 
 [That'd be great, food, food, foood, food] 
  
 [Hook] 
 My Belly is a table 
 My Belly is a table 
 When I’m laying on my back 
 Snack plate upon my navel 
 Calamari pan fried scallops and potato 
 My Belly is a table 
 Say, say say what!? 
 Say, say say what!? 
 Say, say say what!?Oh my God 
 They've got angels sweatin' like Helots 
 Workin' their little halos to the bone combing them deserts 
 My figure eight knotted 
 Lifeline defined traffic 
 The way my schoolin' end-less-ly defined every day 
 One exquisite fitted crisis rivets an octagon of red 
 To the ceiling above my bed 
 It's not a conversation piece, like public spectacles 
 Unleashed more of a clue 
 So when I wake up to the reigns I'll be one step ahead of you 
 I slide like Kodachrome 
 Wrote a poem for every planet 
 Tracked their mileage from the sun in an envelope 
 Licked it, stamped it 
 Got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left 
 Only the earth would thank me later with a breath taking sunset 
 (man, I'm just a bum) 
 Zip that waterfall around your skeleton 
 Tell it to boil 
 Loyalties, the shovel in the soil 
 Dig it, I split my lip kissing the winter 
 Nursed the blister in the sun 
 Strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood 
 Might of worked 
 Sip a little, litter it, love it 
 Without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket 
 Might of, tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes 
 Without hot air balloons floatin' their four passenger baskets 
 And I'm asking you 
 To let a captive lacerate a caption 
 Splash out massive 
 Upholster plastic classes with famine patches 
 I-dentify all saints linked around the fountain's warmth 
 And for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns 
 Anatropic motley clique mockado, born hostile, pacifist huddled in subtle masochist 
 Stamp the blame on following an inkling 
 My fire escape overlooks ghost town market place 
 Martyrs barter passes 
 Then fast themselves to the target's face 
 You're killin' me 
  
 If I had a hammer, I'd build a city on stilts 
 So my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts 
  
 If I had a shovel, I'd dig a hole in the dirt 
 And I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth 
  
 And if your little wing is broken 
 I'll see the poacher in hell 
 I can't afford another anti-burden soldier to cell 
 My carousel mimics the interests of a thousand leaking spigots 
 And a colony of graziers raised to justify the grimace 
 (and yes I read the treaty) 
 I prescribed brevity plus the premise is my pin cushion 
 My limbs pushin' the knitting needle 
 Evils, idle, peddle past the greeting 
 Where the sleepers feed the cycles 
 Stop, watch the eagles board the little engine that could not 
 Ghost in a shell 
 And it fell in my lap 
 Passion posted the bail but the guard had misplaced the key ring (that's wonderful) 
 I lead a fleet of blazing Zaxxons directly into the village 
 Power supply burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye 
 Now how many cadavers satisfy a mad man? 
 And how many crooked samaritans turn plesantville to bad land? 
 I can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing 
 About you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings 
 (well, you're right) 
 Grip your pointed stick, incite your riot 
 I'll sell your worth in a bottle, let profit explain my bias 
 Atomic box cult, downward spiral rapidly 
 Cast to hell with hate mail, forged Christ's autograph 
 Laughed itself, drastic catastrophe 
 Biting my lip 
 Skin and bones, stringent 
 Bingin' on rancid baits 
 Mummified well inside a muddy New York minute 
 Was it 
 Your remnants my smoke rings have cocooned prior to fading? 
 Well, it wasn't conscious spite but it might have been that 
  
 I am not your friend anymore 
 My arrow head dissertation 
 When narrow bed sleepers occupy the basement 
 And I am not your friend anymore 
 Come the dawning of cerulean, your pity blend that we'll spit in the wind 
  
 Man, if it were only that simple 
 I'd add a guilt frame to encore 
 I'd board myself inside my room to trace the wilting contour 
 One petal falls to the rug, she loves me not 
 Town crier lugging a boom box with spirit plugs 
 And a red radio flyer 
 Tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailors knot 
 Fiddler crabs build sandcastles while high tide off azalea crops 
 In the icicle field I portray, cats get antsy 
 And ask 'why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?' 
  
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
  
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
  
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
 Well if it ain't finally a question that's worth answering 
  
 I boogie for the raindrops 
 For the purity, the anger 
 For my childhood recollections 
 For the comic book in my heart 
 The mocked intentions 
 The clarity, passion, seclusion 
 Those cool summer nights 
 For the mark merchant across the street selling me stog's at half price 
 For the mights, the maybes, the nauseating pitfall 
 My girl, my friends 
 For the fact my window opens towards a brick wall 
 For the three legged dog I saw dragged on a leash 
 For the homeless man who walks my block in rainstorms 
 With plastic bags on his feet 
 See I'll throw the weight of ten Earths over one shoulder 
 And walk across broken glass 
 Through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning 
 Not for nothing 
 You'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals 
 Whispering 'maybe Aesop Rock was on to something' 
  
 Maybe, no promises[Aesop Rock] 
 Sulking in bulk and a half, sulk in a laugh, crash test 
 Figure the mixture's digging up his last breath 
 Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftain 
 The tap water is on the waters off the waters leaking 
  
 So this is blue? 
 My frame reportedly sparred in garden variety burners and lost to normalcy 
 My terms the memoir, obligation the bookmark 
 Crystallize impurities to zero on the... 
 Autocrat derby catapult sponges, my hunches hurling murder abundance 
 Lunches where the city sump is pungent, (Curdling!) 
 Tomorrow sits on what the sin/consquence merger brings 
 To bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken 
 Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist (Hi), hung on the brink 
 I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink 
 As for the product, well it's wrenched in a barren backward wasteland 
 Of shimmering moral tension adventuring to blossom pleasant 
 I've done it all, from pixie dust to cramming pins in voodoo dolls 
 And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall 
 But it's like, not a wave crash similar to last or next 
 Heckle me not already doctored by regrets 
 Rain (rain) 
 Belligerent fragments bond massive 
 Usher in the pixels 'til the image burn classic 
 Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket 
 Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it 
 I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches 
 And I know the rat race of the bad taste once its grimace cringes 
 See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition 
 But I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position 
  
 (Prosperity) 
 Sorta makes you think 
  
 I'm a Tomahawk I walk alone and miss the bliss 
 Inside the accidental meeting of the pencil and the seedling 
 And the central started beating 
 Breathing at a rapid caliber 
 I doubt if her allotted grace will last forever more 
 - 
 Dusting off a dream to be an autopilot 
 Still a silent understudy. Funny how the opposite will throttle 
 And the different stroke and model to the prison 
 Is an accurate portrayal of inadequate betrayal of a wish 
 - 
 Gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda didn't 
 Isn't it amusing choosing 
 Yet a plan is hibernating 
 Waiting till the mating dance of motivation took a fine position 
 Dishing only after every little kiddy has performed 
 - 
 I just wanna be a general he said 
 I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said 
 I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said 
 I just wanna, I just wanna be a- 
 I just wanna sleep, yo 
  
 Oh, Eidolon, Capitol Crush 
 Gallop my chariot burning and awful enigma 
 Sprung by the sling of David to pierce gutter bug batch prior to hatch 
 Dismiss it as a soul cadets' excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks 
 This gold star product pushing hate boogie themes Enter the smoke screen 
 Blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive 
 Connect all picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches 
 To candy land image factory. Sold 
 - 
 Oh, I wanna be an astronaut, I got the merits and heart 
 And I bought a starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies 
 When they raised the lights: 
 Ja-ja-Jesus Christ! I've never seen so many goblins in my life! (Oh, my lord) 
 - 
 Migrate through the fog and then some 
 Dragging bitch circuits on a short leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs 
 Well, did you touch that slugger? 
 Banging on the table with an old tin cup, thin luck 
 - 
 I can raise the dead while the shocked settlers fled the blaze 
 Sprung out their bed of nails to spread the sails, racing for milk and bread 
 But I got (big) big plans. I ride a big boat with a big ol' motor 
 And I ain't really that big on helping you turn your leaf over 
 - 
 (Let's sing) 
 Bring out your dead, I got a pile sky high 
 (Let's sing) 
 Run if you're miserable, saw the planet fly by 
 My name is "Try to deny the magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built 
 And I'mma show you why this fucking globe tilts" 
  
 (Repeat 3x) 
 Take me where the air is clear 
 I don't really know where but I know its not here and 
 Every little step she takes makes me spin 
 Cause I know I'll never have to ever sleep alone againCook it up spooky salute 
 Look 'Zook'll hook it up to 
 Shoop the local Winnie Cooper loopy 
 Low brow, low brim 
 She asked me, "What's your name?" 
 I flashed the grossest fang in show biz 
 Young Valkyrie is open, "What's yours?" 
 "Um, Jenny, um..." 
 Body clocked in a ten-penny sum 
 Sprung colossal, "Miss, may I process your Pentium?" 
 But Ae is hesitating 
 "My princess 
 The pigeonholing rose out your predecessor's lunacy in the kismet" 
 Her eyes googled back as that of one unfortunate breed plus a new kink in the posture 
 "Just don't get all barnacley 
 Or get P.T. Barnumed in 3D THX sound stereo dismissal 
 Sorry hun, it's just the last few have been a fistful 
 Like.. like them girls you bump into out dumb luck 
 Get high and innocently kiss once when she's punch drunk 
 Watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch 
 Crazy McCling-a-lot claim instant one love 
 And you've gotta beg your friends to take 'em off your hands like thumbcuffs 
 Or them barbies you'll vibe for a sexy second (lovely) 
 Give it a month Hyde heckles Jekyl and she makes Hitler look cuddly 
 But Jenny in the sky with emerald eyes 
 You're so different so delicious so the fish 
 I'd be willing to walk the limb with 
 So let's just get a few things out the way: (okay) 
 I'm clinically bonkers and hate just about everyone God's great earth offers 
 I won't be getting dressed up to impress your family dear 
 And if I can't wear jeans and sneakers then I won't be lamping there 
 Nope, aggro-pimp, sinfully, finicky nova, bag it up no-diggity soldier 
 Magic touch fingertip donor 
 Own up to your dirty debutante animalistic instincts 
 Ritual courting dance and breeding behaviors (like what?) 
 I dream of Jeannie and fucking her obsecenly 
 But Jenny could be Jeannie so easily if you'd let me 
 Hell, the bad tact daddy-o Merlin-- 'e' for effort 
 Most of these high-post Fabio world motherfucks make my head hurt 
 Dead up-- I got death in the skull but you'll get used to it ma 
 Dinner and cinema, yes, just cough the bread up 
 Sure, he schleps with a naked pocket but I carry dreams 
 Like I wanna be an astronaut after you marry me" 
 (WHAAAAT???) 
 "You're rushing this I feel smothered it's crowding me awfully" 
 Dolly, I love you, "Get the fuck off me!" Sorry. (Call me) 
 And I'm circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly 
 "I'm cool, how you feeling Jenny?" (Jenny?) Jenny? (Jenny?) Jenny? 
 "So quiet, oh I like that, so mysterious, I dig it 
 The way you haven't made eye contact with me once in ten minutes 
 I'm just saying girl, I'm dirty-dog raw vintage mixed with mega-low society 
 Mister gutter-fuck etiquette - try me! 
 So there it is, game. I mean it's not like I'm sweating you 
 Because when it comes down to it, most of y'all females are the same 
 But now it's your turn baby, spit it out" 
 "Okay" She punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away 
  
 Ow! Fuck! 
  
 Watch out ladies cause you know he don't love ya 
 Bazooka Tooth is one bad motherfucker 
 He's a low life pimp with a low life game 
 He needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame 
  
 Cook it up now 
  
 No ring on the finger 
 There ain't no strings attached 
 But if you love television and 
 Manic depression 
 Get a carton of cigarettes 
 And we can make it happen 
 Get to mackin' 
 Just leave your baggage on my curb with the trashcans 
 It ain't like I seen you in Maxim 
 Relax with the tap dance 
 Lights, camera, lap dance! 
  
 Cook it up nowThese wings have seen things most men would melt apart from 
 It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait 
 All my drunk destiny pushed was one radio flyer chock-full of halo parts 
 Ringin this chime like, "Man, I could fix your broken shine 
 We're all Saints swept serpentine 'round charcoal tomorrow 
 Bunk holiday damned. Easy now, brother, I'm here ... 
 I'm here, I'm now, then and there.  I'm, we?  Us?  Them?  It? 
 I'm sorry, I'm ... 
 God, this final extension's beautiful but, friend, I don't deserve it 
 I beg of you sweet Father please detach my chest's polar lining 
 I can't handle asymmetry 
 And if it means my grand finale don't tally the votes 
 Finish me, dormant, with torture-machine silencer-piece 
 Positioned where eyelids will reach R.E.M. well before I'm torn 
 I've never asked for much (Never) never felt golden-benefit worthy 
 I gots what I gots and what I don't gots don't concern me 
 I'm no model, I never aspired to be Velociraptor fossil 
 Man, there wasn't no arrangement 
 Man, I never had a say in this 
 I wanna be the normalcy that normalcy was jealous of 
 No shimmer, no celestial flight mid-winter 
 Enter me now 
 See through Cretin low-life iris 
 (Uh, I, I'm, I'm not, I'm not ready) I'm not ready for all this business that for some reason you all refer to as a privilege 
 Uh, take a look at me, my feathers drag, this harp plays out of tune 
 I fly about as straight as a blind tugboat through my legacy 
 I accidentally killed cupid with his own weaponry 
 And man that was my homie 
 Talk about not cut out for these pristine pearly robings 
 What could I possibly have done? You really want me to steer child populace back on beaten path? 
 Oh god, like teachin morals! 
 I can't be a part of something I ain't soaking my feet in, man 
 I'm from the dungeon So from here on out it's hark the herald nothing 
 Listen, I quit.  That's it 
 But for the life of me, one thing has plagued my being from the get-go 
 Why place these most blessed and sacred honors upon an alley cat like this 
 I just don't get it 
 Oh... my god, it just dawned on me... wait a second, oh... god... 
  
 [2x] 
 You have been a witness 
 You have seen the days when 
 I applied lies in a billion different ways, and now I harbor bad karma 
 Doomed to cope with the fact I dodged the ring but gotta show these cats the ropes 
  
  
 Bad karma 
 Please leave these little wings to erode 
 Please leave this little halo to a child with a lighter load 
 I'mma hold this tight like a life lesson told through a mic[Looped sample]

 [Verse 1: Aesop rock] 
 It’s like antisocial 
 Hazardous portion organically nourished 
 Courage to flourish in music's orphans 
 Lunge nicotine dream missing link weariest 
 Caution we proclaim till brain’s arch like Sagittarius Shield 
 Yield to the eyes as mescaline killin' fields 
 Rise groggy stone gaze marching moodily 
 'til ... plural styles amalgamated beautifully 
 Rudely awoke,sing rubber-glue conglomerates 
 Sucking up love 
 While brushing parasitic critics to my left side 
 I test glide 
 Kamikaze crash distort that's on my preface (check) 
 The therapeutic unit recommended 
 Now slow-mo Quasimotos teeter on ringleader status 
 While I spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus 
 Sleepwalking the atlas after none. 
 Trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain 
 To one-oh-one 
 Run to organize my mood 
 Like cauterize my wound and climb up 
 Lovely samaritans line up like bar codes 
 For a fraction of my factions 
 The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via 
 Amplified files collapsed your cacophonic' conquest. My specs up 
 Morph hostile and docile insubordinance your phylum 
 Chordata asylum swarmes' your coordinates. Rush 
 Must not sleep, must warn others 
 I’ll tourniquet your turbulence 
 Then trample on your stutters 
 If I could displace every vagrant in America 
 With traces of my character 
 The Earth would be a more pitiful habitat 
 With infinite acres of auto-cry intricate nature 
 Swung open the nomenclature to obscure warlock trickery.Pure 
 Hazmat got tossed back by liquors supporting patience 
 Working knuckles for audio duplication 
 That’s like fiending for a purpose 
  
 [Looped sample] 
  
 Aesop Rock, prototype Robocop 
 Jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop 
 I possess two siamese styles that’s like connected at the mic hollering monstrous 
 Poly-tech impede indidgy progress, deaf 
 Swept off your meridian. It’s operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey 
 Can I like, conjure up like all potent components of like 
 Middle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like 
 Hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take em' down, pass em'round, rock em' all. Bust it 
 I’m forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a 
 Sardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance 
 Tsunami rain blast lift off like origami cranes and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter 
 While slaves defy water sucked through from paper bags 
 The magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melt the triple glitches on your console 
 I calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable 
 Unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce 
 While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils 
 Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program 
 Elegantly overcast password curse an a tactless bastard 
 Catatonic until personal practice mastered

 [Verse 1] 
 Three's company, Appetite for Destruction tee 
 Chunky Monkey, Funyuns, I can feel the cat judging me 
 Please, I've seen you eat your puke and drink the toilet water 
 Which completely renders your opinion void, you little fucker 
 Poison puffers hit the reef, hissing through their missing teeth 
 Pissy like a Minotaur with six hours in the middle seat 
 Or middle schoolers protesting the mystery meat and Catcher ban 
 Castaways walk into the same light as Carol Ann 
 Dagger in his teeth and treat a rapper like a rack of lamb 
 His allergy is middling, his middle finger's Plastic Man 
 Dag, they want a de-radicalized youth 
 Though it sort of undermines the magic of high noon 
 My right hand writing a diary of the dodgy 
 I do the wrong thing when all the right people are watching 
 It's a medley of defiance and outfoxing 
 Born in a storm's eye alongside Long Island swamp kings 
 Bonk, shoegaze rap, get your blue suede 
 Get used to the goofy get-a-clue face 
 Jump into the goon goose chase, try the Kool-Aid 
 Try the blue plate, it tastes like doomsday 
 Off-leash gryphons at the Westminster Kennel Club 
 As vessels of Beelzebub, bite the hand that belly-rub 
 Lug it to the belfry, keep the pups alive and healthy 
 We, as hunters, treat the summers like a mother ripe for milking 
 Up and feeding Alexander Pardee art into the silk-screen 
 Still here, sleeping with the lights on and quill near 
 Tour van, corpse paint, war moon 
 Make the bass wobble like a two-man horse suit 
 Dork-proof, type to forge a sword in his dorm room 
 Break fiends, drain threes from the warp tube 
 Long tooth, short fuse, Stormtroopers over John Zorn loops 
 If you ain't core, it ain't for you 
 Trolls, bubbling from the lows 
 Want nothing but to run him for the bulk of what he owns 
 Homie, all of this material ain't shit to me, the trinketry 
 The filigree, the antiquated theories of validity 
 I never really cared for the cars 
 The Point A-to-B sounds scared when it starts 
 Trash can fire in the middle of the crib 
 Where the coven swap recipes and riddles from the crypt 
 It's monsoon season, keep the log flumes leanin' 
 Religious paranoia get the Doc Seuss treatment 
 Breaking out the Bronx Zoo, tabletop the Mongoose 
 Grey fade; ain't afraid to knock a few cogs loose 
 I'm from where it's "Defense!" on three 
 And anybody with a fucking brain bump Sean P 
 Old boy, might combine the carve with the stalefish 
 All aboard the mid-life snail's pace tailspin 
 You were busy authoring the holy grail of mailed-in 
 I was busy snow, sleet, heavy rain, hail, wind 
 Ready, aim, fail shit, it's Hail Marys everywhere 
 Over all the petty shit, under all the messy hair 
 I'm (Untouchable, uncrushable) plus ill 
 We don't need another hero, we just want our cups filled 
 I'm Trivial Pursuit cards at the 40/40; buzzkill 
 Aesop Rock, code name: "Yo, son, chill"[Intro] 
 It goes welcome the pop off, some pop soft 
 We bang b-bang b-bang bang out loud 
 Ready on the left with a face full of death 
 We slanged out fang mouth bang out now 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 This is a never dug disco 
 Zoo York tycoon, memorandum bonanza banter clamp crunk out the fish bowl 
 Gorgeous how struggling gills wriggle out water, ain't it? 
 Same scape as the walls crawling with paranoia's plaintiffs 
 The robo-komodo promo Zen patience a-alike to this jittery drooling mess 
 Bitterly unruly on mud hugger alert, he usher dirt to the kick circus 
 Deflected labor ethic questions peeled at the field workers 
 (Is it raw?) Please... does a priest need a ten-foot pole to baptize little Linus minus the lap ride and tease? 
 Evolution is a leader depleter 
 Seeker needy sheep idol feeder beware, once complete you might not want to be there 
 Dead straw to gold bar spin fiber 
 Lost and found in a smitten kitten's incisors 
 They Aphrodite all over the burgle of a purple heart compartment 
 Marched a burgundy carpet alarmed and far to parched to bark it 
 Lil' Abner, a real firecracker 
 Grows to throw 'bows with vehicular hijackers 
 To eavesdrop plots cops hired a wire tapper 
 That's a whipper snapper trapped beneath my grip on the fire ladder 
 Took drums over to deril' to once over the line tones punch toothy ticks 
 'til they find homes like three ruby clicks 
 The roof is on fire where snoopy sits right now 
 You should have shot yourself in the foot when it was in your mouth 
  
 [Hook] 
 Thieves in the strobe deep freeze your pose 
 For the disease that grows underneath your toes 
 Holds up a reason y'alls gold never seems to glow 
 Now we can all breath slow once the fiend's exposed 
 It goes heave ho. You never got the grit right. Bark fame but you never put the grit down 
 Hawk styles but you never got the grit right. Put the grit down. Grit right. Get down 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 This is a never dug disco defamation of dog and pony grappled out chincey 
 Chipping Leo Da Vinci 
 Phonies pushing kill of hill bloated. Nobody got you 
 While biggest brother's watching bigger brother watching big brother watch you 
 Nothing says circus fun quite like nuclear holocaust over breakfast on the terrace. Hash browns and peril 
 Old ironsides or good ship lolli-popper 
 Davy Jones still got a locker, ak 
 The opera's more than docs and soccer moms 
 Now before you kick your feet up 
 I married and divorced mother nature after sweet-talking that old hag out of a pre-nup 
 This information's neither braggadocio nor secret 
 Just know as of now the world is technically not yours, peanut 
 It's a day in the life of the carnie dog-faced boy escapist 
 Living large, watching Springer, smoking beedies wrapped in bacon 
 At night his get busy disease leakage peaketh 
 Merk the he say/she say, BK Jesus turn peg legs to Adidas on the down stroke 
 And they like 'what's up with the name?' 
 I tell'em y'all made Bazooka Tooth I's about to ask the same 
 But before you curfew the city and shut down every block, I'd like to say I still Aesop the fuck out of the Rock 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 This is a never dug disco. Spread feelers. Tonka zonk Gepetto bred beezers 
 Jeepers, gee wilikers, goshes galoshes, Christ, god almighty 
 They tore his limbs off kilter, still the hostage moshes slightly 
 Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche 
 He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly 
 He woke, promoted bug-eat-face, insect chopper's biting 
 He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted 
 He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking 
 He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him 
 He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty 
 He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely 
 I alert vital spider works to cultivate grit, ship the bulk grade shit 
 Herbie the love bug drugs pulsate whips 
 Tie in spite for commoner idiocy and good old-fashioned biblical plague 
 We move units off your pagan escapade 
 And it's pits to the peg legged 
 Make us eclipse cripple, so that pimp's limp, wheel chair basket bow when 15 minutes fizzles 
 Your flimsy frame marks hip-hop's second most tragic event 
 And will 'til Jam Master Jay's resurrection and second death

 I forever wallow in glitches 
 Grimly distributed by side effects 
 Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches — drenched 
 Cradled between dense pillars of polar value 
 Lies a grey soul blueless 
 It's got I fiending for the sky 
 (Synthesized lies rise synthetic) 
 Sitting inside solidified plastics 
 Whose lateral burns germ-compatible 
 My firm's radically piloted 
 Dodging a fire swiftly 
 Yellow-brick stalker walking shifty 
  
 I'm but a prototype Metroid programmed to holocaust style 
 While you're sulking in the stages of denial 
 Your petty soldiers stand fragile like Giacometti sculptures 
 Embedded in eremetic cultures we's rocksteady vultures 
 Plus I's the geyser throwing a soul 
 My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles— 
 Berzerk! 
 Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jaded 
 Stripping, color my passion mitigated 
 I'm slipping 
  
 [Ann Colville] 
 You always seem like a small grey cat to me 
 Sleeping underneath the silvery moon 
 Paws curled beneath your head 
 'til the sun came 'round just around noon 
 And you would greet me, purring in your doorway 
 Drawing at your tail around my hips 
 And I would go into your mouth wide open 
 Waiting for my language to come from your lips 
 And I'll move you 
 And you like it 
 Just enough 
 To let me 
 How I hate you 
 Cause you're lonely 
 And you know how 
 To forget me 
  
 [Aesop] 
 For the love of my personal practice I reside 
 Where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawal collides 
 Slide fueled by the fury 
 Spun a ring around my honor 
 But the opulence took shelter in my parlor 
 Melancholy masquerade 
 Cast amongst the braiding of belligerence and 
 Blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement 
 I stay special agent 'til the sky falls 
 Reverse the curse 'til my fellow Lost Children disperse 
  
 [Ann Colville] 
 And your footsteps leading down the pathway 
 Never seem to be quite like my own 
 Your mind and smokey circles 
 Have blinded me, 'til I turned towards home 
 And you would watch me falling in the distance 
 Hands held high above your head 
 I only leave the territory when there's nothing left 
 To be said 
 And I'll move you 
 And you like it 
 Just enough 
 To let me 
 How I hate you 
 Cause you're lonely 
 And you know how 
 To forget me

 [Aesop] 
 I make music and connect color to canvas 
 Swoop down from the trees with potpourris of other bandits 
 Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace 
 Saw my planet lead starts burning from the outside in: 
 Meaning your clout lies thin 
 Salt prep the blades prior to fire phase in my ever-changing underworld 
 Serate a day to decorate a traitor 
 That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades 
 Follow my portion: 
 I'm gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter

 And he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out 
 Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine

 Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman 
 Sick of pushing skewed information 
 And abusing the nation 
 Had a few options: 
 Either jump or run (RUN!) 
 Quit or cold raise hell waving a gun (GUN!) 
 Time for C-H-A-N-G-E 
 Held a knife to the VP on TV 
 She demanded that the format be expanded 
 Beyond fair, everybody clear, understand it?

 Billy was a coke fiend 
 Maggie was a cop 
 For the dope he stole cream 
 She patroled the block 
 Banking off his old scheme 
 She recognized his plot 
 He thought he was home free 
 She knew that he was not 
 Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car 
 She pocketed the crack before they got far 
 Billy watches Maggie from behind steel bars 
 Like "Where the crack went?" 
 "I'ma smoke it tomorrah"

 Blackjack, big spender 
 He was married once 
 Till he bet her ring finger 
 Seen leaving Las Vegas 
 With a pick up truck, diamond 
 Fourty large, and beautiful wife piece 
 Less than what he came with 
 Hitched to the crib found nickels in the couch 
 Hitched back to the casino with in an hour 
 Said "I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents" 
 And was immediately shot to his death over debts

 Jill didn't, then did it 
 Jack fell

 No cell 
 But hell, you jump the bar so well 
 Parted your partners veil and dipped 
 I'm New York harbor 
 Tale of a sail, ripped sorta 
 Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace 
 But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday 
 Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway 
 He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow 
 Same one she used to hold in both smiles 
 Dagger the instinctual last shout if it killed me 
 So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free 
 One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back 
 Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks 
 They never missed it 
 Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink 
 Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick 
 I'll love you forever, cuz you know me better 
 For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second 
 But kill the rekindling dreams, and navigate the friendship 
 Or else by the time the stress airs out we'll both be dead and friendless[Aesop Rock - Talking] 
 So you want to be a carpenter, do you? 
 Well it takes more than a hammer, boy 
 You're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and... 
 Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war 
 Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame? 
 Sluggish posture just won't cut it 
 You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes! 
 And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help 
 And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone 
 And, where's my pencil? Go get your hard-hat 
 Here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper...

 I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs 
 I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun 
 The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit 
 Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it 
 My stitch in division/division warfare's numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning 
 Is a flying color phantom tantrum explicable? 
 Sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens! 
 Behold, pity the lowlife parish? 
 Doom City barracks left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris 
 To the badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands 
 Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman 
 Frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay where the landshark Parliament swims 
 When they pause to polish they fins 
 The better brains will preach the village through the city square 
 To the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate 
 Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase 
 Ooh my born flight simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly 
 Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die 
 Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp 
 Had that phase when the deviltry contacts a sparkle in my eye 
 Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink (Right!) 
 Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks (Okay!) 
 My house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled (Why?) 
 Cause I stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry 
 Come visit me, it's fascinating 
  
 [Aesop Rock- Talking] 
 Now here's how its done, I'm only gonna show you once 
 So pay close attention, hear me now or hear me never 
 Glue your little eyes to the diagram 
 See the plywood, the nails, the glue? You work every inch 
 Your domain and you must treat it well 
 Keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole 
 Where's the T-square, hand me the pliers 
 Now dammit, oh, this will never do! 
 You have to want the castle, head Up, shoulders back 
 Be the materials, know your limits only to break your limits 
 Are you listening? God dammit boy, pay attention 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Try it again, little bit more juice this time 
 Try it again, yeah, a little bit more elbow grease this time 
 Try it again, concentrate, a little more focus this time 
 You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help 
 Try it again, you're not doing it right, here now, y'all watch 
 Try it again, stop sulking, I'm the example, for real, Watch 
 Try it again, I'm bout to make it easy for you y'all, just Watch 
 You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help 
  
 As if it didn't sting enough 
 The hunt dispatched a pack of wild dog silhouettes 
 All sulking by the skyline, focused with a bonus hunger pain 
 My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the muck of 
 Ancestral branch camped on the vessels 
 Yes and I abide, the laws of the hidden desert survived 
 And every peasant present teetered it on the crescent less deprived 
 With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests 
 Of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess 
 I double the negative (Double the negative), to no avail, no promised benefits 
 Just delegates peddling pairs of negatives 
 With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut 
 Now what of the madness fragments? 
 Stagnant 
 How to make a vision sing while twigs cling to your pigeon wings 
 Fission militia, indent bent to split blood in hell's kitchen sink 
 Organize civility simpleton citizen mixers, then kiss the sky in unison 
 Sinister city-blistered corporate hooligans 
 All I really want's a nickel to feed my little pig 
 Redefine big dig, three cheers to the product 
 Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process 
 On a slanted advantage point saw the makeshift criminals date rape the hostage 
 Dream away the plain pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks 
 And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks 
 All I ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle I got 
 See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop 
  
 Try it again. I don't want to (Repeat 8x) 
 I'm not even interested anymore 
 Try it one more time[Aesop Rock] 
 January, I fell to the cobblestone 
 In April, I cut little paper flowers 
 In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome 
 In October, I was introduced as coward 
 I love New York Saturdays 
 But Mondays last longer 
 And since I plan to live a long life 
 Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn 
 To merge the week for all its got 
 To give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs) 
 I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull 
 And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage 
 I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle 
 And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel 
 Then I settle in a stand still 
 I live forever reaching for the sun 
 Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful 
 Rope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil 
 And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye 
 The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal 
 I never felt so damn young 
 But you don't look a day over zero 
 And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize 
 The night is near so 
 Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges 
 I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges 
 I never really knew the true definition of precious 
 Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message 
 I'm a fully animated life tree 
 See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song 
 Of I'm a fully animated life tree 
 With branches for the heavens to admire naturally 
  
 Chorus [Woman speaking] 
 Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine 
 Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate 
 Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem 
 Health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 We all know what a halo is 
 But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips 
 I be the matador making your pretty little heels click 
 I be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse 
 I'm incredibly exhausted 
 You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete 
 Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning 
 For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic 
 Every little step she takes breaks the chambers 
 In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble 
 Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour 
 Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour 
 I ain't been around the world but I been around the block 
 I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk 
 I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ 
 I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice 
 I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles 
 Fiddling with a theme, dream solid 
 Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish 
 You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise 
 Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate 
 I make a true spur of the moment grown decision 
 Which in turn allows me to be something normal 
 With the prefix of the 'ab' and 
 I can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that 
 Rockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it 
 Be the little guinea pig, dig? 
 I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water 
 No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch 
 It's like that 
  
 Chorus 2x[Aesop Rock] 
 Smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills 
 Guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills 
 Hollring 'no I don't immediately ameliorate 'em 
 I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em, and rate 'em, see if I hate 'em 
  
 [El-P] 
 Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top 
 The tweeter meter blew code def hones in 
 I pack a lunchbox, walk to the stoning 
 Jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning 
 I'm irrational, paranoid, tragic 
 And the button on my chest says 'panic' 
 Punch it, hold up, don't touch me 
 I'm a savage from a rabid ass country 
  
 [Camu Tao] 
 Who want to get it? 
 You all acquitted 
 You need to quit it 
 Getting evicted, you little idiot, pitching tickets 
 It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits 
 Body you up at the party, somebody get his mistress 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart 
 Then you kick back once the inertia start 
 And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark 
 The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark 
 See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm 
 And when the first arm's found we observe the art 
 Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb 
 Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms 
  
 [El-P] 
 Tasmanian pain coast, ridin' 
 Very little to say to these politician behind it, but this: 
 You better loosen the noose or lose livin' 
 These little kids walking the ave. quick to produce a biscuit 
  
 [Camu Tao] 
 Now you should medicate any area that the pain hits 
 And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers 
 The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos 
 They be looking for any situation they can play on 
 Respectively injecting these thoughts, detain us 
 Negative speaking, they be creeping, they entertainers 
 When you out of data they run through a route that'll save ya 
 In retrospect, infect and pressing your papers 
  
 [El-P] 
 I design kill pain cave penmanship 
 Federal analog hog unedited 
 With a CUNY degree in young numbness 
 Angels on the rooftop, gun in they trumpets

 Periscope down, hop Boss Hog cruiser 
 Porcelain or pewter authority will be over ruled the second jukie uber alles news hit the sewers

 Gazelle glasses, chase rap daily

 This city fit my style exactly 
 Near the train tracks 
 In the garbage bags 
 Where the cement cracks, we a part of that 
 Rickety rackety 
 Rickety rackety 
  
 [Camu Tao] 
 When you take 2 to the vein, introduce 2 to the brain 
 You don't get used to the pain. A maniac bruising the cage 
 When cats rush you in the public you be like 'do it again 
 He's a motherfucking bloodsucker, he can do what he can 
  
 [El-P] 
 On the side of the block, do the bus stop 
 You paying a fare? 
 That's a trust fund 
 Little ugly ass duck, life's a fun fuck 
 Too battered to rush, I walk punch drunk 
 And the whole world is yours now 
 Before the steppers are goosed kick your door down 
 I'm in the getaway whip with Aes Rizzle 
 He got the same shit stitched in his missiles 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Okay, lefty field..stealth 
 Dressed to kill..self 
 Megawatt with a horizontal neck spin 
 Swims bloody to vertical bobble-head yes-men 
  
 [Camu Tao] 
 When the evil falls in it draws to the pours 
 It gnaws to the core 
 It's precedent in that you represented 
 A percentage that wasn't vintage 
 And the crawlers hate us 
 You automated, we all the flavor 
 Niggas you oughtta hate us 
  
 [El-P] 
 Anyone from Antagony Squad, Family District 
 Testify that the look in my eyes is genuine issue 
 I'm a freak of the flesh. Penetrate. Lust 
 Bathe in the vaginal juices 
 Like God is up in they undies 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Don't picket the misfit law, Nancy 
 The core's no picnic. Misled whores advancing 
 No business. Insist lured with candy 
 To cure citizen x with that all-fours dancing 
 Corporals landing 
 Ashore, all soar boned nitwit, rickety rackety porn fancy 
 Weave through the hell and high water hot zone 
 Diseases in the minute the idiot got home 
  
 [Camu Tao] 
  
 Now I'm a teacher, 1st grade, and I want to participate 
 I want to grade the papers but I don't want to give them A's 
 O.k. F, D, F-, test time, set timers 
 Call every parent and give 'em a piece of my mind, shit 
 Cause I don't want to give a good future 
 I'll shoot ya. (Shoot ya?) 
 With an Uzi filled with rulers 
 Fuck minors, flush minds. Even leaving 'em bruised up 
 Stack kids, pack cute lunches in the cooler 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
  
 Rickety Rackety 
 This city fit my style exactly 
 Near the fire ladder 
 Where the wires gather 
 Drink water, eat fish, smile after 
 Rickety rackety

 Rickety Rackety 
 This pussy fit my dick exactly 
 With a threesome 
 Giving treatment 
 Sex on drugs, girl you can't keep up 
 Rickety rackety 
 Rickety rackety[Verse 1- Aesop Rock] 
 Hey, yo, must not sleep 
 I bash the bracket open and breach 
 The priority's bleached since that '76 umbilical severed 
 Majorities cordially abhor the pinnacle vendors 
 I got West Nile virus on my TV in the Bronx 
 I got two hollow pockets and a sleepy hollow mosh pit 
 Tryin to blow the spot with wet matches and bottle rockets 
 While cop walkie talkies squawk outside my apartment obnoxious 
 Tonight's special consists of stale fiber from shitty diner 
 Look mom! I learned to tie my shoes! (Hey, can I borrow twenty bucks?) 
 Peel back the prickly cocoon to Poloroid turbulent land unit birth 
 Student first pedagogue only from brazen action 
 Wind blown mariner east river shark parry lunge carry funk endzone caliber 
 Watch war face painted jukies dance blissfully around a bonfire and sacrifice live sanity 
 Pay a nickel for nose-bleed seats in a peanut gallery 
 Gallop with a pegasus 
 Malice with no benefits 
 Balance with some sense of bliss and the foulest degenerates 
 My New Year's revolution's gon' be to stop burning bridges 
 I'm just 'gon bend 'em toward the couple cats that's worth the visits 
 And um, it's like that, and that's the way Aes thinks, and um 
 Plans are like clipper ships, if they got holes they sink 
 And if the skipper slips the crew shits bricks, wither, and hit the brink 
 That's why I take the poison's bitter sips and smile big when I drink 
 You never knew mayhem walked with Nikes, talked like a trucker, hawked the filibuster, Gerber baby lucid Colonel Mustards 
 No time to hold my breath (Nope!), I'm only here to rap, eat, sleep, grow old, and smoke 
 Stoges through the hole in my neck 
 New millenium, mad cows and Pentium, process the hostage, lock him in the petting bin 
 Show him pictures of his wife and kids, then wash the brain 
 Probably the same motherfuckers that buffed the trains 
  
 [Hook 1] x2 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay 
 Must not sleep 
 Must bash the bracket 
 Pay the rent, pay the debt 
 Must slash the fabric 
 Catch the jackrabbit 
 Pay the rent, pay the debt 
 Sleep... 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Roll into the city with one half of the cannibals (whose that?) 
 New joint bumpin out the whip speakers 
 Made the escape for a night of making tapes now it's back to the cockroaches and preachers 
 Somewhere a prom queen's giving birth in a bathroom stall 
 Hauling a prime directive not to get blood on her mother's ballgown 
 I'm son of a stubborn old one-track jackal 
 Brisk, truckin' with prime directive just to get the goods and never fall down (Raw bomber!) 
 Ate the city, spit the bricks 
 Ate the boxcar, spit the burners 
 Ate the planet, spit the murder 
 Funny farm brain patient writing rap for milk money, built ugly 
 With a couple side effects to make'em love me 
 My cipher demeanor left Jesus rubbin genie bottles 
 Til the following morning Colombo found a crown of thorns in urine puddles 
 You're in trouble! 
 I'm not trying to save the world, I'd rather watch it die slow 
 So I could spit my grand I-told-you-so 
 Are we having fun yet? 
 Yup, step to the carnies 
 Try to win a teddy bear to impress your favorite Barbie 
 She almost sucked you off at the company Christmas party 
 But she won't accept the bear 'til Aesop signs it with a sharpie 
 My ex-girl bounced without payin' the cable bill 
 I checked myself in television rehab 
 Withdrawal symptoms may include shivering, fevers, drooling and chronic masturbation 
 Now I pray to the gods of pornography and Playstation (No!) 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the lord my soul to keep 
 And if I should die before I wake 
 Give my ASR to El and bury me with my mistakes 
  
 [Hook 2] x2 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay 
 Must not sleep 
 Must bash the bracket 
 Pay the rent, pay the debt 
 Must slash the fabric 
 Catch the jackrabbit 
 Pay the rent, pay the debt 
 Sleep... 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 ...Bonus round 
 This is the hot tin roof stepper 
 Hold it down with centipede foundation 
 Mr. Greed who burns rugged obstruction in bunches 
 Like little Jackie paper puffs the magic dragon in dutches 
 We don't need another hero homie, gallop off on your my little one trick pony holly hobby Polly Pocket pretty fuscia destiny 
 If the slipper fits fire up Cinderella propeller and curtsy for the munchkins right before 
 Aesop Rock smashed the pumpkin 
 Yeah, yeah, iron on gusto rustolium bloodstream what's better? 
 When the wrist slit it leaks out only the bloodiest bubble letters 
 Complete with outlines, fill-ins, dates, shading and shout out columns 
 For vagrant colonies to follow when redeeming bottles 
 You're a little tea pot trying to eavesdrop on the mammoth route 
 Peaking out from the rosebush like (Uh-huh) 
 "Here is my handle (Ohh), here is my spout" (Ahh) 
 Godzilla jukie used to be in love, now out for gigapussy 
 Sorry to offend but sometimes life bends in the middle (Sorry!) 
 So now you have a fulcrum where there used to be a pillar (Right) 
 And now I got a pulse that bumps less than a cocaine binger 
 And now I got no nine to five and still labor days flicker 
 (This kid is ill)and now I got a nine millimeter Q-tip with an itchy trigger finger 
 See, I really don't feel your persona distortion 
 Ordered by martyrs who martyr self for martyr's sake 
 Wow fame. If notoriety grew adjacent to jealous dick-riding sentiments 
 I'd give you a pound like, "Greetings Mr. President"[Intro: Vordul Mega] 
 New York 
 I could probably put some shit over the "New York" shit 
 Staten Isle 
 The Up-state, Tri-state, Universal 
 (Just for my people) 
 All day, NY, New York, Yeah, From NY, Long Isle, Bronx, Brooklyn, Up-town 
 Yeah, we're where it’s at 
 Get down 
 In NY, we're where it’s at in NY 
 Get down 
  
 [Verse I: Aesop Rock] 
 I cut the ropes breathe 
 Fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke.  Load bazooka 
 Scoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah 
 Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie-cut the wattage 
 Electric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip 
 Conditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen 
 My 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender, novelty 
 I tip lids prior to clipping the comradery 
 Check the muck out 
 When metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division I tug my brim down over my astigmatism, low pro 
 Paxil Rose, Axl broke and butchered 
 Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers 
 King Kong potluck, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms 
 Just Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam 
 Serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day Uzi purchase 
 The foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous 
 Me? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker and um respect” 
 Find out what it means to me, New York 
 Walk blocks with electric ninjas who bark/bounce for trunked out whips 
 Like, "My company DeLorean's the shit" 
 Skipper's out of happy pills again 
 He's in the neighbors garbage.  (Ahh Skippy) 
 He's making paper dolls decorated with targets  (Don't do it) 
 He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists (Nooo) 
 Then tearing out the still-beating heart from the loose-leaf carcass 
 I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic 
 Built it in three days to float above snarky comments 
 My gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations 
 See, New York is ancient Rome.  Basic.  Basically stone.  Faces 
 My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases 
 "Some of them will blossom famous", some of them will blossom baseheads 
 But they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what? 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 N, Y, Electric, Catalog, Burners, Pigs, Magnums, Crack, Bag lady, Roach bait, Pristine kicks, Thread and the iris of the needle

 Here we go 
 Dah dah dah, dah dah dah 
 Dah dah dah, dah dah dah 
 Breaker 1-9, 9-11-01 witness, maybe you don't get this 
  
 [Verse II: Aesop Rock] 
 Kill 'em all slow 
 I was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a C-Rayz-Walz show 
 Nether-circuit bacon don't police me anymore 
 Your trained professionals demonstrate 41 shots over par 
 Least common denominator raise truth like Charlie, Willy and Gramps raise roofs in a glass Wonkavator (Monster Maker) 
 Operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter 
 Talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner 
 Paid dues since before the days of bad acid and Quaaludes 
 While the boombox talks trash to the Richter 
 Stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole 
 Bitter fucker, nothing is free 
 I'll spend my last dollar on me 
 Put one up for my family, should've made time to thank 'em 
 Put one up for my crew, for recognizing the sanctum 
 Put one up for the socially broke, choked and smoky New York piss hiss bleed Dolby, homey

 Welcome to NY Electra 
 Where buildings fall and hopes crash, niggas 
 Yeah, I’m Vast Aire from Can Ox

 [Hunter Interlude] 
  
 "You’ve been all over the world 
 You’ve hunted just about every kind of game 
 You’ve stalked elephant, lions, tigers, polar bears, deer 
 You’ve been within 15, 20 yards the most dangerous game in the world 
 You’ve been everywhere 
 You’ve been with some of the most famous guides and hunters in the world 
 What’s the biggest thrill you’ve ever had out of all of that?" 
  
 "Well I think I can answer that best by calling attention to the ..." 
  
 Bazooka Tooth, bitch 
 I'm saying bazooka "tooth" right?  Yeah 
 Bazooka Tooth, bitchI was sitting on my fire escape and I saw 
 Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons 
 A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess 
 A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in 
 A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin 
 I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog' 
 A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers 
 A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down 
 A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town 
 I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags 
 I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting 
 I saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all 
 And then he sat down with his hammer and saw 
 Business men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks 
 A Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet 
 A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames 
 A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses 
 I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair 
 A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare 
 A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign 
 A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time 
 I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver 
 A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer 
 I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street 
 And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds 
 I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student 
 A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it 
 I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes 
 I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets 
 Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage 
 A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance 
 A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette 
 Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents 
 I see a crack in the sidewalk 
 A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots 
 Sitting inside bent meridians 
 There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout 
 Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams 
 And children in the hydrants 
 Hybrids, I see sirens 
 The wall to the glamor standard 
 A dead bird, a red curb 
 A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work 
 I see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing 
 To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers 
 Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard 
 A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury 
 I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors 
 Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little moreThese lil', lil' fuckin' Martians 
 You gotta love em' though 
  
 Mars attacks wit' electric gats 
 Not for sapien abduction (what's up then?!) 
 Billy took a laser to the mug piece; hollowed out the mandible 
 Channel headquarters, order the cannonballs (Mars attacksssss) 
 BFI demands column to this pigeon ankle 
 And boomeranging' our harvest; 51st area sickness 
 Not a threat, nary a witness won't injure the promise 
 Monster lead- carry your ligament fanged in the mosh pit 
 Dodge phaser, labor days are major A, sir 
 Cater the alien decomposer soldier platter like Caddy Shack eight 
 I told her "Go for C4 magic's" 
 Smolder as did Bazooka Tooth holster fabric 
 (This fucker's rabid and still breathing!) (Hiding cabbage!) 
 Oh, the heater claps to leave me 
 I'mma ninja this shit with sugar in the fuel tank of the saucer 
 Buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels 
 Ice pick the soldered ship wiring; pissed off the mother and um 
 I'd be lying if I said I knew your intentions 
 See my sexy sabotage thinks defensive action'll save the race 
 You lend a hand on board to mention magma (Blaze the place!) 
 Spread fire of your revival, there's wires in your Bible 
 Obviously, ultra tech advanced when I point-counterpoint 
 Comparison of ET vs. little old freak me (She be on somethin') 
 Hey riddle sweet peas wit' your nickel PCs, fickle CDs, miserable TV sitcom (Typical!) Pathetic ritual collective slackership 
 Beautiful establishment; you ain't established shit! I consider you foul 
 Prowl back to the numbers under burnt pride in the dark (Sup, y'all!) 
 They want us dead or alive without the alive part! 
 The sun rose over a body bag shortage 
 Last week I was like "God bless the saint that invented the cordless." 
 This week I sorta re-routed of the bull's-eye of my worship: 
 Temple-body slash full cabinet master my diversions 
 Fuck y'all, lets do this shit; My movement soothes any space invader practice 
 Stomped up to enemy like "Hey what now, bitch!? 
 I am human, hear me rise above material and cardinal sin." 
 They shot me in the face: 
  
 Mars wins. (Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins...) 
  
 (God morning, sir. May I show you something? Sir.) 
 (Jet-black smoke on the horizon.) Black smoke in the air 
 Maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssss wins! (I thought you would like it.) 
 Who you screaming at dog? I got this! (Let's go.) 
  
 Zig zag 'zooka, pinnacle stitch 
 Unleash the unlimited edish primitive piss 
 I slip a cynical Mickey to most military ops 
 Monkey - here's how the filament drops 
 We on a pre-three prong ancient elephant tusk 
 Betamax fully, break bread 
 You shruggin' it off, keep it electric, sure 
 But NY Electric's not about electric war 
 It's "hunt, gather", see the poor man's clan set bait (Last page!) 
 Three, two, one, domesticate! 
 In the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny 
 Sitting on them Barney Rubble twenties, subtle; 
 Sipping saber tooth blood puddle- 
 I could roll with the lackey's, that's if we hustle 
 Knuckle in the mud, hell's bells in the chuckle 
 Red-berried face means smudge around the muzzle 
 I'm allergic to the now-born solar panel cuddle 
 Stole cold to the core, dirt menace 
 Stone cold sans Alcor cryogenics - stubborn 
 Can't talk shit with a tongue full of rug burn 
 Got bad cholesterol, good blood sugar; 
 Four-piece heartbeats wit' a subwoofer! 
 I'm not asking you to act like you notice (Oh, Aesop's SO Mesozoic.) 
 And now I see that cabinets pills be old (Potent!) 
 Open the mirrors while I pulse with the voltage 
 Keeping me alive is the vibe with the Vulcan's hope! 
 Tangle the vine catapult (Catapult!) 
 I break it down to the bones of the crux with the goals of the age old 
 Eat. Sleep. Fuck 
 Structural droids; more bounce for the buck 
 But they want a last stegosaurs - thorns in its butt (buck wit' it!) 
 Prehistoric land shark business, cradled in the arms of the karma and kismet 
 Swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier 
 Beggin' for the freezer burn; back every day, sir! 
 Sir, your science loves to fuck nature 
 Sir, your right to the dawn of my day, sir 
 Sir, your violent lab coat and beak can vivisect witches til we all catch vapors

 Don't call it a sound-off, "Mars Attacks" be the malarkey downfall

 It's not a game no more, run from the flash, leave your panic at the door 
 (THESE) 
 A lotta of magic gadgets, give em all back just to nullify the savage 
 (PILLS) 
 Mics crumble if we rock 'em right 
 In the year of the troglodyte 
 Saw a grey mouse gravy poured on a board 
 To the dull morose world like a lull in a storm 
 And I know you was hopin' that the piece for the ox was a dull sword, Ahk 
 Guess what: it's not! Guess what else: I transmit for the block!

 For the yesterdays, or the next I can assure you if there is I got the sword

 My every little step set in a star 
 Retina scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar 
 Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered 
 Not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile 
 My experience with a spirit alignment interference 
 Assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling 
 Let's note the magnificence in the difference 
 Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire 
 To separate lullabies both of which had me drifting 
 Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss 
 And list picking from the arrangement under burden 
 Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster 
 Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble 
 I've never seen the water so high in my poison life 
 Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct 
 I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause 
 Well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times 
 Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess; 
 One man's trash, you know the rest, live it 
 Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard 
 When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot 
 Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers 
 Wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer 
 Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend 
 I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin 
 It's like that 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit 
 I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit 
 I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall 
 To live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall 
 And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall 
 And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall 
 And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all

 The most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets 
 Water basin leaking, plug it up 
 The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection 
 I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony 
 To nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me 
 And so the epic went and every cirrus hung 
 The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung

 You about ready? (Yeah) 
 Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder 
 And good evening wonderful riddance and such 
 Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo 
 Trimming the tunnels end off end with tenants spangled 'cross 
 A more tangible premise 
 This splendors, shimmy splinters all up in day-tripper visuals 
 Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can 
 My palms are chinrests 
 When I witness fury scurry past my window 
 Model city in a bottle plugged hostile 
 Its bliss kissin pollution 
 And a billion suckers pucker in a bind 
 Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure 
 No, but they insist it man, I'm 
 I'm trying to spin me dizzy, sponging up to giving dungeons functions 
 As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions 
 Everybody drop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical 
 Marveling at the spite with which it curdled 
 Outside my tenement: coax a little warmth 
 From out the mugs of masons wasted 
 Laying bricks for days to later find they own the lot adjacent 
 Mark the blasphemy, elements of eloquence and savagery 
 Murder the gossip, fuck it, run off happily 
 The broken spoke cyclers choking open Doctor Zaius born fetus 
 In a matchbox keylessly padlocked to the hammer base 
 Now these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles 
 Shedded in the hell tale to motivate behind suspended leverage

 "Let us hope that the horrors of evil 
 No longer loiter on the doorsteps of your past" 
  
 Circle of sandbags dragged to shield the meal the needy hand grabs 
 I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis 
 Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pebble toss 
 Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address 
 Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine 
 When trappers slack, the traps unlatch, the catch covers the tracking lines 
 That will make his majesty furious 
 Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense 
 If only, yeah but I'm lonely 
 My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash 
 My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh 
 Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips Personifying mankind's end all aspirations 
 Hope floats... 
 No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked 
 I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked 
 And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance 
 I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence 
 Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides 
 Arachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes 
 If you can squeeze between the bars (then please!) 
 Enjoy my space employ my waste 
 Encase the hand dealt by a stolen grace 
 Do you ever wish the circle was a square 
 So when landsharks start circling the borders 
 You could just cut them off at the corners? 
 There's a ghost in the basket of values 
 Pertinent to, which cayak pilot succeeded in surfin' it through 
 Now I'm surfin it through 
 So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name 
 Above the mess near the other funny requests 
 See my all too tolerant mannerisms have hired a whim 
 To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins 
 Of innocence 
 A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise 
 Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested 
 A mile in humble shoes, ten shades of blues come off the difference

 Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed 
 Surfing to bash the coach of bigot procreation baked in fanciful 
 Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill 
 I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots 
 And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void (No they can't) 
 It's James and the Giant Tugboat Complex and he's annoyed 
 (No one's asking you to build an ark brother) 
 Yeah, it's fashion 
 I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger at 
 Then realign mine eyes in divine justice 
 Plus this uncontrollable laugh 
 When those Amber Waves of Grain finally crash 
 Brimstone, cloned with legs and dim poems, 10 little Zen crafts 
 Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants 
 Picket well around a burner style clinic 
 Acid for the basics, Ph-imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless 
 Then fabricate day trips 
 I wanna be the halo that jumps off the brain 
 Of the genius who decided some pictures deserve frames 
 (God and I are on first name basis) 
 Yeah I call him "God", he calls me "Jesus" 
 When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces 
 Blame. Dragon. Up hell's creek interrupting a devil pageant

 (Okay) Tell me who you chill with, and I'll tell you who you are 
 I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar 
 It's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance 
 To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen 
 It's revolution pushing through the loose pins 
 Of the straight-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category 
 They had him parallel with a tattered glory division 
 Aka them who drink dreams out a thermos with a whiskey after-burn 
 It's like, 9 o'clock wake (I'm up), spit obscenities 
 My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone, then work my deviltry 
 The clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunder chaser set 
 That got my paper crane's wings wet (oh no) 
 Voyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus 
 I dance for chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post (that's fine) 
 I done my chores according to God's schedule 
 With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals 
 Metal-edged cadence that tends to repel the bevel 
 Kettle screeching out the operetta (operetta) 
 I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's backfeather pens spurting magma 
 Curséd television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra 
 Minor, (M-M-Major). Disperse slap on the wrist 
 For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship 
 Sunk with a "yes sir" chained to fatigued ankle leagues beneath the angle I'mma call home 'til the Rock meets the angels[Aesop Rock] 3x 
 Every little step we take breaks the dreams 
 Of a war pig itching to re-stitch the seams

 Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete! 
  
 Ox will spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror 
 My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever 
 Yo, challenge an Ox member, get a valve severed 
 Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert) 
 Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran 
 Plus enter battles talkin shit like "Look mom, no hands" 
 I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me 
 You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched 
 I treat MC like K-9s 
 Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch 
 I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette 
 Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes 
 Man, if the mic had ass cheeks 
 The sticker in my hand would say priority seating 
 And man, I don't know if it was me or you 
 But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin' 
 You play the role, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you 
 The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual 
 One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention 
 Cuz you need love and affection 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock, Vast Aire] 2x 
  
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders 
 And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler 
 City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter 
 Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet 
 Feelers activate 
 Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm 
 I hold a book of matches captive to flash if 
 The sunbeams flatline 
 Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches 
 The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches 
 One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center 
 Housing style pageants 
 My little limbs lasso katydid wings 
 While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon 
 I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of 
 Mass times weight times tamed semantics 
 Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage 
 To hell with plastic, we edit splendid 
 Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it 
 Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again 
 It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences 
 Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts 
 Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint 
 He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear 
 Let the tears braid 
 And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade 
 Gold-plated tomb or spittoon 
 I couldn't see 
 I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree 
 The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance 
 Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance 
  
 Chorus 2x[Verse 1] 
 Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly 
 Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock 
 Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit 
 Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card 
 Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap 
 We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn 
 When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm 
 Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp 
 Spread thank you (3 on the right) 
 Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left) 
 Yea I knew the percentages 
 But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis 
 And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs 
 Agent Zip Zooka swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE 
 Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!) 
 Tug a noise box trigger reporting for hunting

 'Till the 'uncle' spitter beg a jungle pig to hug mercy (Ha!) 
 Two 40-below shit, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!) 
 Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures orphans (ok...) 
 Manufactures ornaments, if it moves stick a fork in it 
 Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates 
 Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian 
 Whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyr's skin 
 No Semper Fi (Nope), no saluter unit 
 Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfur 
 And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs 
 I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!) 
 Sun down, goggle up canteen gobble-juice 
 Teargas nozzle up. Brain buff, hostile youth 
 Chop it up, lock a noose upon it

 But it's big! Big and legitimate 
 Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds 
 So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47 
 Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!) 
 Muddy-gut snake eyes, he approaches cobras with an ugly muck 
 And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines 
 Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon

 I shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly 
 Only after having logged every cadaver accordingly 
 High scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled 
 (There is no cause iller than no cause at all) 
 Okay, if his perspective is merked, sneaky detective work is aborted 
 And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert 
 No bed of dirt sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!) 
 Now I'm center city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*) 
 Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers 
 Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!) 
 But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles 
 So he missed the little boy inch the pin out the pineapple (Heh) 
 Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe 
 Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!) 
 And just as quick as the parachute cable snipped 
 I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed 
 Link a baby pool around the standard issued weaponry 
 While fading as a blemish in civility's memory 
 They will step over the body for the looting..

 (close to insanity) 
 One child prodigy with a vision in his core 
 (close to insanity) 
  
 [Verse I] 
  
 (yeah, yo) 
 I'm frost bitten, slippin' away in titanic burden nurses 
 Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service 
 And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh 
 Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath. (Breath) 
 These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash 
 Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak 
 Malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow; 
 I'm shook in a freak side show! 
 OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink 
 So I design this chorus line 
 When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall 
 With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage 
 Then see the wide-eyed dried raisin supplied fiery Colossus 
 Well, I am a hostage. Guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate 
 Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this 
 I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity 
 God damn. Must have remembered me 
 It clinched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it 
 Apprehended me, and rendered me suspended in its voyage 
 How these tables have turned! 
 Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label 
 Sip the ladle. Drank the burn. Begging for dead! 
 Concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web 
 Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled 
 OK, OK, I get it... 
 Let 'em shake a little, then release 'em 
 Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion 
 Odium, patience ran his anti-death commando 
 Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil 
 But couldn't quite catch the angle 
 I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper 
 So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched, come on... 
  
 (yeah, yeah, check it) 
  
 I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating 
 (close to insanity) 
 The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing

 Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply:

 [Verse II-IV] 
  
 Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn 
 By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes... 
 To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we 
 For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug 
 I don't wanna pull the plug... 
 Hug on my canteen like in a dream 
 Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league 
 I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed 
 If the breed should have ever been bred. 'Nuff said... 
  
 Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon 
 To emerge, or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge 
 All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn 
 To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner 
 Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king... 
 More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring 
 Mood swingin' from the mezzanine level 
 Here to bevel the edge 
 My team's settled on the ledge to pledge 
 It's like that 
  
 In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains 
 In the winter it's the same, with an added climate change 
 The remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for mid-range 
 Yet the songs of thirst remain the same 
 You could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor 
 Hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem 
 I never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh 
 So do your magic, miracle worker, or I'll remain unimpressed 
 For the flux, the fix, the famine 
 For the fact that little Billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon 
 I'd examined auto-pilot (right) when filibuster won... (yeah) 
 Concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement... (oh shit) 
 It's intriguing. Yet, I guess, I knew somewhere, something was leaking 
 Now I honor instinct, delinquent 
 Bring settler runaways, frayed boogie bastard clicks 
 To bypass glass stature, walking graft characters... 
 Militant dance split the sun and sip the filament... 
 Tracer. Vivisection is to lab rat primes; 
 They try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine 
 He knew. He brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets 
 Then sought off all trickery, bought off the public, and screamed victory! 
 Tunnel through the mite infested grillage and the rig 
 As fast as Aesop and his ten little fatigued fingers could dig 
 Trigger revenge, tip the goblet in the dirt, review my words 
 Spit in the puddle. Peace to fame, struggle the fuck out, and duck out 
  
 (yeah, check, huh, uh) 
  
 Now, all hail defenders of the trash talk 
 (close to insanity) 
 I was hidden, yet I slid in just to rip the mask off 
 (close to insanity) 
 I'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds 
 (close to insanity) 
 So y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground! 
 (close to insanity) 
  
 (It's like that)Cameras or guns one of y'all is gonna' shoot me to death 
 Just know that shit 
  
 I take it easy...(x4) 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Upside-down I pick wings from beetles 
 Pry 'em out and pin 'em to the pole over the see-saw 
 Sofa cobra shimmy out crater 
 Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension 
 Versus AM clock radio bangers 
  
 Downside-up in crippled acres 
 And still the fountainhead spittles sniglets 
 Quicker than quidditch seekers snatch golden snitches 
 You could be a part of it 
 Just park your bark at 20 paces 
 Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership 
  
 Man! the city bred the brittle cheapo 
 Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole 
 Media breather needy burrow to hide all 
 While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall 
 Curl a worm tongue tight, bitten behind the vamp chopper foaming 
 Lamb choppy sock puppet fear and loathing 
 Need phoners a.s.a.p. to build careers out of misquoting 
 So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives 
  
 It's a pocketful of nickels, like Cool Hand Luke decapitating 
 Parking meters when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills 
 I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth 
 Now in the time that you did the paperwork 
 How many'd the rapists merk? 
  
 Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes 
 Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show 
 You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos 
 Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high note 
  
 [Hook] 
 I take it easy, the ice is thinning in the valley of the jeep beats 
 And when the freaks come out I hug a TV 
 Somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy, it's bliss 
 Repeat with a twist... 
 Ea-sy 
 When every martian in the market holler feed me 
 The all-city opinion spigot leaky 
 You learn more when your mouth piece retreat, it's bliss 
 Now listen to this...oh OK 
 All day every day, oh all right, all night every night 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Whose capitán gon' spew stale venom? Not mine... 
 I hug a hammock in the bedlam 
 And when the potentially lucrative race horse gets deaded 
 I'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings 
 But I cannot Cratchet crutch the Ebenezer limbs much longer 
 Flaccid flimsy songbirds, classic dizzy wrong turns 
 For the long term got a dragon all achy 
 Torn between the lending of a helping five knuckles 
 And a charter your own escape 
 Now it's like, sufferin' succotash, bucko, ducks in the chuckle patch 
 10-4 on that, stinger operation, wingman double back 
 Fuck it, Let him roam the home of the mange ridden emaciated 
 Slave pain cave children game 
 Not all players heal the same! 
  
 Learn it or don't learn shit 
 My radio is on regardless 
 I tune out pardons and tune in starlets 
 Carbon and pre-David/Goliath live Paleolithic bias 
 Who walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas 
 Now it's Thor dwarf war hammers, Elvin bow and arrow aimers 
 Documentation of the rate at which narrow tapers 
 Hermit crab, honest cat, trying to raise the roof in my own TV room 
 And still get the security deposit back 
 Call Ripley, Skippy 
 Motorhead dope fixture on some 'Go to bed, no dinner! 
 Hold your head, cold winter!' 
 Ease up out of the ghastly, desert dozer cliques stranded on cloud 8 
 Proud of their pogo sticks, I stay left 
 Along came a spider, sprung and alert, I stay def 
 He makes records with his tongue in the dirt 
 Suffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt 
 Buffer the mighty tighty sequins with a price on the merch 
 Covert Mr. Blizzard shoulder, he always acts all pissy 
 Plus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me 
 No bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye 
 Kill it, you are the weakest link, goodbye 
  
 [Hook][Aesop Rock] 
 On the train 
 Watchin' the rainbows (thank you window seat) 
 I mean, it's all the same to some 
 But that cityscape makes me numb 
 Walkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap 
 Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed 
 In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard 
 Suffered for circlin' nutrition (seems barbaric) 
 I may have just saved your children 
 There's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle 
 For The pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels 
 I interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright 
 I interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole 
 I was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked 
 So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place 
 We 3 sprout from the same litter 
 Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors 
 I sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard 
 Half my time is herded toward little lost causes 
 Half my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets 
 An' I'm here to pose inquiries 
 I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring 
 Little Billy starlet up the block got the right premise 
 But can't thread the needle without consultin apprentice present 
 I don't really know you (I don't) 
 And I dont' really care (I don't) 
 Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare 
 Maybe that deems me that vagabond you love to kill 
 But I really ain't got time for the motherfuckin guilt 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin' 
 Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening 
 Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace 
 Set sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous 
 I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin' 
 Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening 
 An' I'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun'l never shine 
 I've got my book I got my dream I've got myself an' I'll be fine 
 (My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still 
 (My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will 
 (My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill 
 My time's the final mile before the valley meets the hill 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 And I'm an archer 
 Parked where the farmers barter appetites 
 Sweet-talkin' harrassment down to a mere flashing of badges 
 Prototypic landscape chased every step of my well-oiled collective 
 Workforce with frozen intention festive - wait 
 What about the captivated? 
 Well, I am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked 
 Scattered amidst blue fields of fiery bliss mixed with 
 Disease applicant activist rattlers. Fascinate grave child 
 Oh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb 
 God, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would 
 I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push 
 You see my mission responsibilties range across the board 
 Until I'd rather be a pen than a sword 
 I swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready 
 All edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy 
 (Sorry, well sorry) Honestly take it or leave it 
 Just let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness thoughout the evening 
 Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose 
 Tryin to pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost 
 Fragile in more ways than ten yet sturdy bird construction 
 Help the smokestacks puff until the morn, dream torn 
  
 [Hook] 
 I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin' 
 Packed up my belongings then it's off into the evening 
 I've knocked upon every little door that comes about 
 I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch 
 I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin' 
 Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening 
 This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still 
 I think I can, I think I can, I think I can 
 I think I will[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 Deliver us from evil 
 Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone 
 Grim tone, bring him home 
 Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously 
 To those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety 
 Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap 
 Curse the digs 
 Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss 
 I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig 
 Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will 
 Make your bio sound less cool 
 If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse 
 You might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before 
 Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars 
 Patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing 
 Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief 
 And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth 
 Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit 
 The googly off the daily paper 
 Clip red or blue (Blue!) 
 Either way the shredder chew 
 Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 I put a beetle on his back and take notes 
 Play a dealt hand. Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt 
 Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior 
 Help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck 
 He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye; 
 Filter sheepish winter through its sister on the outside 
 Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you 
 Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets 
 Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him 
 Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment 
 Walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em 
 It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches 
 'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics 
 Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs 
 Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed 
 No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish: 
 Curfew the city that must not 
 Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt 
 He will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupant

 Rotten egg, not to be pegged as fashionably tardy 
 The difference is the latter got the freebies from the barkeep 
 Wait, Aes-fucking-Rock is in the building 
 The room looked up, looked down, kept sniffing 
 Slit the neck and slip the chip in, sipping anti-governmental zombie grog 
 But zombied up gladly on your Swiss Army watch 
 As if twitching upon your authored condition's 
 Really that different from administered conditioning glitches 
 Kissing a firewater pitcher with the fatal Drano-chase game 
 It's hiding in the Nang labeled with the day-glow face paint 
 Some buckle when the T-Rex treks shakes the puddles 
 My huggable jungle 
 My son of a dove cry, humble, even doves die 
 I took the black outta something to judge the lung by 
 I took the mag out like the crack out of a bum's pipe 
 I hook the tag up like a flag over the plum sky 
 Mud pie cruiser with an oink for the innocent 
 I blame it on the ambiguous quote unquote system 
 If a quota needs some filling you're a whore 
 Sincerely yours, engine number nine conductor 
 All aboard!!

 This is not your ordinary ballad 
 With a perfect little bow around the middle 
 And a black knight on a white horse 
 Or a white knight on a black horse 
 It's got all these tired parts where 
 We don't even sing and random 
 Princess raise the drawbridge 
 We don't serve your kind 
 It ends where it begins 
 And the beginning isn't pretty 
 Can't forget that not-so-perfect 
 Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...) 
  
 And it goes a little something like this.. 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant 
 Gut the cruddy frame 
 The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame 
 Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants 
 And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor) 
 I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits 
 Sew your first martyr stitch 
 Join damaged mammoth brigading caper 
 Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser 
 I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses 
 In case the hackers snatch the plumage 
  
 [Dose One] 
 So you mean these things are worth money 
 Now drifting off 
 This is the who-you-calling-homeless 
 Mock me fearful 
 Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert 
 And you're in it, Ichabod 
  
 Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying) 
  
 My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying) 
  
 With my eyes patched in a not so new universe 
  
 So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many... 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Oh it'll be soon (real soon) 
 Balloon immune to doom blend 
 I ain't ditchin' the kitchen 'til every spoon bends 
 A glance along tomorrow, sorry 
 Looking lot of hopefuls was the rain dance 
 My little flint never dreamed would flutter potable 
 See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste 
 Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming) 
 Hmm, You want to be a Czar?, idolize fallen heroics 
 Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it 
 Who put the fun in dysfunctional? 
 I, prodigal son combustible, donkey-punching pinholes 
 In uncomfortable Zen conjunctionals for good (good) 
 The bear cub slop a goblet of dirt wine 
 I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine 
  
 [Dose One] 
 Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and a plastic bag noise 
 Sunk down around his head sick-sick-sick-sick... 
 Stealing a peak 
 There's sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone 
 And nothing terrible happened to the bag 
  
 Wrongs spilled off in... 
 And brought on out the clouds... 
 The hiss cuts out... 
 Spill its voice... 
 And the piano... 
 And the window full of... 
 Star is fresh... kept 
 From where I'm going... holy other 
 Holy other, holy other, holy other... 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 B-B-B-B-B-But 
 I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart 
 I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart 
 I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart 
 I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

 And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business' 
 That was to be in vain 
 Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished 
 Finished yet? Now uhm... 
 I usually finish this number with uh... my skull open 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches 
 Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions 
 Then the masses wanna lean on me like "oh captain, my captain" 
 Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments... 
  
 [Dose One] 
 Button, button, who's got the button 
 Take my name, please... 
 Button, button, who's got the button 
 Leaks the little gentle man made of lightning inside my lock-box 
 Oh, you like to help with coats wait unti you see what I got in this here locket

 This is not your ordinary ballad 
 With a perfect little bow around the middle 
 And a black knight on a white horse 
 Or a white knight on a black horse 
 And I can't forget the not-so-perfect bow around the middle 
 Round the middle, round the middle, round the...[Verse 1] 
 Yo, broken glass everywhere 
 Aesop Rock pissing flares on city staircases next to the base heads 
 Follow holographers spitting crowd mayhem simulation 
 To feed ego blood arraigned, then launch operation food chain 
  
 Sleepwalkers pile at the eyelets down (flash vipers) 
 So they catch a bad one like one eyed graf writers 
 Its utterly stunning inside the great escape chase where 
 Kitchy snitchers crowd outside clouds of suspicion like 
 "I'm one look in the first place" 
  
 They capcorder certified A-1 blue ribbon sucker pride 
 To be preserved mammoth out glacier, run away by prize 
 With broken dignity 
 These wooden wings got Geppetto jealous 
 But when a boy may detect every lie, "I can fly" 
  
 Looky here we the digital hyena click serpents (surface) 
 I'm a third straight citizen, stellar 
 Caught up in, no 
 Brought up in a cripple triple six lidagin cellar 
 Where under a creaky step huddled to scorn of this old yeller 
  
 Yes, you feeling that? 
  
 Maybe they didn't understand the ramifications encased in the new Blockhead dental plan 
 Hit it squirt 
 Run of the litter 
 Warpin' morsel 
 Camper 
 Mommy's little helper 
 Pumpkin 
 Puppy dog, I'd fuck up suck trouble 
  
 Tractor 
 Mix your little pigtails Mr. worst version of burden born dead 
 I'm over your product 
 Your living existence is but a wing nut on the training wheels 
 A bitch called politic cycles 
 Idolizing germ breeding and worm bibles 
  
 Now when I say it’s on don’t percolate pimp strut 
 Miss delicate whiz 
 Maybe you ain’t graspin' how on it really is 
 Identify futility 
 Curtsy that poodle skirt 
 Pirouetting veterans get urine mickeys 
 Sipped and begged for settlement 
  
 [Hook] 
 So long, good bye 
 Have a nice day, try not to die 
 Be good, farewell and have a wonderful trip 
 Try and not let your pretty little heart skip 
  
 Be strong, keep your head up high 
 Try not to fall into an awful style upon your first try 
 I'll see you the next time you decide to come visit me in the zoo 
 And by then I just may have written a song about you 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 And if you lookin' for a friend 
 You knockin' on the wrong door holmes 
 And if you lookin' for donations 
 You got off on the wrong floor holmes 
  
 Follow twelve steps; the perfect vivisection 
 Honor thy alignment with mercury climate surgeons 
 First we meet 'em, then we burn 'em 
  
 I can pick apart skylines that foxtrot on your legends 
 It's yellow jacket upon saccharine spillage (child spirit) 
  
 A pow with a wild gear shift 
 I'm Jesus Christ with wings and nicotine love 
 Pick a dream cause it won't be there when your beer tips 
  
 Now you can let the horns blow 'til you're blue in the face 
 You preach the end of your rope before the dawn of the shoe laces 
  
 As far as I'm concerned 
  
 Every lost lamb sees through a bulls-eyes 
 The hand that feeds happens to hold a hammer and a lie 
  
 I sell prosperous futures in bottles to freaks with awful karma 
 You're an early Wright brothers experiment 
  
 Surrogate mother television 
 Born where the peasant kids bought her deficits 
 Lack of attention vs. lack rockin' for the hell of it 
  
 Monkey thirteen 
 Seen with a broke crown around the bend 
 Pissing on cloud nine from cloud ten 
  
 I can sit at the well's bottom alone 
 Rockin' a coffee mug 
 To fish the offering of every little late nip penny toss' wish 
  
 You're the reason god made vacations (ok...) 
 I'm the reason god made the people that made god make vacations 
 I mean it's all got to balance, right? 
 Scrape digital spear across belly 
 Settle back-lit worms back by Saturday night 
  
 Walked hungry 
  
 My seal is stitched out monopoly money 
 I'm a turntable with new needles 
 Life's a barrel of junkies 
 Screaming "shove them in" 
  
 Cuff em' in purgatory, gloat 
 Please don't be the motherfucking tug boat 
  
 [Hook] 
 So long, good bye

 In the district called the Barbary Coast 
 Nickelodeon showed scandalous moving pictures 
 The coast was described by one indignant critic 
 As "that sink of moral pollution, whose reefs 
 Are strewn with human wrecks 
 Here, blear-eyed men drink vile liquor 
 Smoke offensive tobacco and engage 
 In vulgar conduct. Here are: 
 Debauchery, disease, insanity, blasphemy, death 
 And hell, yawning to receive its putrid mass." 
  
 (The ground shook, and the sky burned...) 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 These are the unregulated rabbit holes 
 Barrack homes and taverns built for devil's acre 
 Opium enthusiasts and baritones, marigold 
 The garish allure of the burning Barbary 
 Underbelly born of 40 thieves in whorish harmony 
 Hammering for the dark and heartless 
 Harpy, shark and harlot argue breathing room 
 Do not let the arson jeeper-creeper you 
 If we elect the scenic route see it as greener grasses 
 Like morphine after snatch help you forget diseases matter 
 Not to mention 15 cents for either weakens cheaper gamblers 
 Down for hell inside a melting pot 
 No one's ever melting they just yell a lot 
 Stab each other, drink and eat and belly-flop 
 Murder Point, your thoroughfare at 12 o'clock 
 Is hell and back, EMB to Chinatown 
 Kearny clashing cutters out the netherworld 
 Sydney ducks to pistol fuck the centerfold 
 Every cellar iniquity, pretty killers and pistol petes 
 Might wake up to horses tearing at your limbs symmetrically 
  
 [Hook] x2 
 Tomorrow morning when the wharf is finished warping 
 You will wash up on the shore and wonder what was so alluring 
 (El-P) 
 Tomorrow evening when the leeches finish feeding 
 You'll regret the ownership of an aorta that is bleeding 
  
 [Interlude] 
 In those days 
 The volunteer fire brigades 
 Competed with each other 
 To be the first to reach the fire 
  
 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 Before a later bay was calm, disreputable hangers on 
 Would rumble for the hungry like Montgomery's little Genghis Khans 
 Who plain as day would operate in holes where no patrollers go 
 Groggeries that host the most ignoble dog and pony show 
 Francis of Assisi in his grave alone to roller-coast 
 His opus now a cove where all the lowest lows can grow and grow 
 With no sign of a holy ghost 
 More the polar: horns and rosy cloven toes 
 Bunny-hop claims, fold and overthrow 
 Gangland anchors hit the harbor down for hangman 
 Shuffle fifty two and slip the chew behind the fang-span 
 Greenhorn, he just wanna help his hammers harmonize 
 Stowed in hell's cargo by the spark in those Wells Fargo eyes 
 And famine wasn't featured in the pamphlet, neither were the cancers 
 Camp was smoking chimney, mantle, taxidermy antlers 
 Now the sourdough is lifted out the honeycombs of kitchens 
 Satan out on Broadway and Pacific blowing kisses 
  
 [Hook] x2 
  
 [Verse 3: Aesop Rock] 
 40 winks, pissy at the grizzly, no lullaby 
 Clark's point trollops off the docks to flood and multiply 
 Until a brilliant golden motherlode in the bank 
 Hold up your drink 
 She said between her legs that other gold's pink 
 Sold it for cheap along the waterfront, wretched little clusters 
 Push a fuss of smutty huffing plus some itching and discomfort 
 Little wonder you, in public for the buck, it's rugged 
 Rusty cutter gut any cutty drunkard who want it 
 Hellcat Maggie, aggie, move to the music 
 She had learned to spoon pollution in a climate pruned for losing 
 Thousand more like her in the cow-yards moo-ing, ooh-ee 
 Beneath the brutal harvest moon and UV 
 Note it's the very same foundation on which you and yours sleep 
 Layers of players over debaucherous troubadour speak 
 They puff the pathogens and never let the humidors breathe 
 That's why you grew up on stale tobacco and juniper trees[Aesop Rock] 
 Shooken to Casper 
 Illustrate beautiful disaster 
 Flight of the mother ship lift to badger the male-factor 
 Marionette versus the threat of wire cutter function 
 Stereotypical Grinch bashing your pumpkin 
 Plug, try to count up your warrior hatchling batch before gestation segment ended 
 And head a platoon of embryonic remnants to the game board 
 Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops 
 Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate 
 One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted 
 Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches 
 From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces 
 I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up (Yeah) 
 Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn 
 Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs 
 As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail 
 I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails 
 Family stuck, voyage of the S.S. Martyr 
 Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water? 
 Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter 
 We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink 
 I think I can, I think I can 
 I got grips, muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships 
 Walk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous 
 Cause my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Fascination, fascination 
 Fascination, fascination 
 And everything I do I'm fascinated with 
 That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions 
 While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle 
 Fascination, fascination 
 Fascination, fascination 
 And everything I do I'm fascinated with 
 That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk 
 Cause I feel I got direction in my work 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 And everything I touch magnificent 
 Picking apart a drunken township 
 Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with 
 If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today 
 "The Day The Earth Stood Still" while I complete my search 
 You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems 
 As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle 
 Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy 
 Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community 
 And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm 
 Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast 
 With a delectable style compiled of that which stands 
 To buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living 
 I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory 
 First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood? 
 Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers 
 Who truly felt they were born to touch the music 
 I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones 
 Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard 
 I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper 
 And leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy 
 Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow 
 Brother, I own twice my weight in patience 
 Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb 
 I'll be listening 'til you whistling that more suitable tune

 Park your bets 
 Sharks or jets 
 His bark mark targets where the barnacles nest 
 They burrow deep under the carnivore's flesh 
 Without a trace 
 Carnival games 
 Like try to shoot the star out of his face 
 Come double fist them aqua-gats lock box your past and 
 Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics 
 Walk off with a thumbs up 
 And a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket 
 Pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day 
 Yeah that's the ticket 
 Yeah that's the pipe dream 
 That's hater 101 bitch pigs 
 Living guilt trips for the fan base family picnic 
 Who's handshake carry with it 
 Y'all inspire me 
 It's an honor to meet you 
 Now it's randomly fantasy beef stew 
 That's panicky pre-school 
 That's Keebler signs Pikachu 
 And he's poking pinocchi-beezer 
 Where big brother watching ain't 
 Holler back Wally Cleaver 
 Knobby-kneed geezer 
 Whose brittle peddle boat sank 
 Wishing he could re-stitch the images when the kinescope cranked 
 He couldn't 
 You can't 
 My more-than-two lamp with a mongoloid loyalty clause 
 And a done did got busy ambiance 
 That's Lazerface, Megalasaur, Scissor-tongue, Liftedly 
 Money-Murs, Ramble, Printmatic, Hangar, Blockhead and Ravipops 
 And the fam only begins with the last two bars he dropped 
 Add the chrome fangs I'll rewrite Heavy Metal Parking Lot 
 That's why these grapevines could pop shit to me all day 
 I only kick these fucking doors down to make sure the crew o.k 
 Like, food on the plate 
 Thread on the back 
 Kicks on the palette 
 I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets 
 While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge 
 Threw like girls and misconstrued the lucky fuck floaters for talent 
 It's sad really... 
 O.k., I'm over it 
 Smolder over composure models like smoke over soldier nostrils 
 3d bifocal goggle broke over cat walkers 
 There must've been something up in that Long Island tap water 
 Grew to mute Grinch north of Who-ville and his frisky sissy poodle pack 
 Oozing that hollow 'who the mac?' act Aes threw back in junior rap 
 Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols 
 When the whole reason you liked 'em was cuz their shit wasn't recycled? 
 Come pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't heard it 
 That's no burden 
 Need attention? 
 Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses 
 Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin 
 Purging little man behind curtain opinions 
 This is perfect 
 Look I'm just like y'all 
 Living low-pro to paycheck 
 And when the landlord hollers he hid the 'dro in the tape deck 
 Rocket radio 
 Every success smidgen he harnessed 
 Parks with risk and sick with it clicking in perfect working ratio 
 No frisky out of dodge name blame for sneaky plots 
 With elevated rung placement derived from deep-rooted jealousy issues 
 He cue the raging bull and every due is paid in full 
 With that I forget all you motherfucks that failed to pull 
 Why? Well 
 What's really good? 
 Not a cat who peddles backwards for a hacker's filthy looks 
 Hodge-podge menamena-Muppets available in rubber stamp form 
 Hogwash Harry clamp norm 
 Wear the space cake baker? 
 Order up 
 Curb his pacemaker 
 And vacate personal space in relation to face-raker 
 Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to '88 with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins 
 Probably when Oz's friends slept on the poppy stems 
 Horseback 60 M.P.H 
 One hand rolling tobaccy badly 
 But it burns out cavalry of concerned worms for mayor 
 But you'll find validity in a penny, right 
 And I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off Yeti 
  
 With a knee-jerk response to his budgetary woes 
 He's hooky out the institution's huckleberry mold 
 Style leapt out a Hermann Rorschach margin mark 
 Starving art smashy to slash a martyr heart 
 Trashy to lap her garter belt 
 This is 6 flags Definitive Jux baby 
 We like, love it or leave it out your holler box now 
 Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit 
 You're spilling insignificant frijoles[Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 I am not doomed (not doomed) 
 I burn bridges, not spoons (not spoons) 
 But I only burn the bridges, hitchin' life in locked rooms 
 Passive obstacle assessment: 
 Bound to blossom festive knock on wood 
 Salute the little lonely troglodyte that could 
 So they navigate the blame game with a bulls-eye on a gold link wrapped around shrink-wrapped persona 
 Honor in a makeshift crooked thug version of sacred 
 Not to be mistaken with the purity with which my angel masons storm the basement 
 Rope ladder descends from mothership, c-sectioned, monstrous 
 While a billion babies build forts out refrigerator boxes 
 Burrow, for the too far gone platoon craft billy clubs out fallen apple tree trunks 
 After apple seeds sunk well beneath them 
 My style sits softly in a synapse between fairytale and logic 
 Primarily Agnostic 
 Idle while the tidal title deem heat waves worthy of swallowing your journey 
 Wallowing across the nursery 
 I arrive tardy. I've offended every last pedestrian 
 Upon my way over to bless that bar seat 
 There's no excuse, I know, I'm sorry, but I'm here 
 [Slug] Which is more than I can say for my love of these puppeteers 
 [Aesop Rock] Well they tug 'em all in perfect syncopation, make they mommas proud 
 Certified absurd prince of flattery 
 Product of a drunken, rhythm-driven faculty 
 Check a mortal mayhem discotheque, boogie with a bounced check and a cigarette 
  
 [Verse 2: Eyedea] 
 I prick my finger on a thorn bush, picking you a lilac 
 You can water it with your envy and burn it with your livestock’s 
 I guess you can come on my trip, why not? 
 Tie knots in our existence and marry-go-round your holy tripod 
 For every single flame the imploding sky drops 
 I cross the burned bridge of syringes ? by lyrics ? cyclops infinitely focused on moving this ice block 
 I could of land a nice job, but I plan to fight God 
 Understand I might stop at nothing, short of order distorted by torched porcelain images of man 
 My glands are quite dormant coordinated with porous 
 Won't forfeit my stance and transmission if I hit the right knob 
 Fright clot, numbs the thumb, run and stir the rice pot 
 The anger that hovered kept me in a tight lock 
 I'm parallel with every line Jesus Christ thought 
 Leaving heaven frozen, rolling a seven on this dice shot 
  
 [Verse 3: Slug] 
 Slow down, float showdown at the show 
 Minnesota to Manhattan until it gets broken loose 
 Holding you immobile to show you what we're going through 
 And ain't nothing changed and the rent's still overdue 
 Still hate the rappers that speak through the mean mugs 
 Ain't got no bite but you bark like a tree trunk 
 That shit doesn't flush 
 [Aesop Rock] And every pipe is plugged 
 [Slug] I know you're loving us (you ride the nuts like the dick was a bus) 
 Now hold tight, your whole energy doesn't flow right 
 It's enough to make me wonder if you prefer to just blowpipe 
 We're this close to giving you hoes a good choke 
 Clowns thinking they're profound man, they're not even a footnote 
 I walk around the world like a malnourished tourist 
 A refugee, caught between the referee and the purist 
 Circuits overloading, cyborgs about to explode 
 Release the little man inside my tired soul 
 Somebody must have let the lion out the cage 
 And got him high before he climbed up on the stage 
 Cause here I am again, glossy-eyed, topsy-turvy 
 And this is just another pitstop on the journey 
 Most of ya'll don't even inspire me to diss you 
 So caught up in the politics, forgot to kick the issues 
 Slug, call me Se7en, ya'll know what I'm about 
 Now close your fucking mouth, before my balls fall out 
  
 [Outro: Slug] 
 Shut your mouth 
 Shut the fuck up 
 Shut your mouth 
 Shit talking bitch 
 Sick of ya’ll talking shit [shut the fuck up] 
 You don’t know me, you don’t know us 
 Half ya’ll fucks don’t even rhyme [little bitch] 
 Who you talking shit about man? 
 Go play a video game you little bitch 
 Shut your trap [yo you a critic?] 
 Yo come to Minnesota and get smacked [get smacked] 
 Come to the island and get smacked [get smacked] 
 I don’t care, I see you in Oakland and I’ll smack you 
 Shut your trap, little internet bitch 
 I’ll smack you in Tulsa 
 I’ll smack you in Buffalo 
 I’ll smack you in Milwaukee 
 I’ll smack you in Madison 
 I’ll smack you in St. Louis 
 I’ll smack you in Austin and in Dallas 
 I’ll smack you in Salt Lake City 
 Beeyotch[Verse 1] 
 I skunk the blood up as to numb the public interface 
 Before the anime corrodes I'm tryin' to fork the figure eights 
 Hogwash etiquette, truncate long haul leverage picket 
 Outbuild auto-bricklayers with 10 guerrilla digits 
 A to Don Darko, bark O beautiful piranha gossip 
 Cobwebs on the Kafka, choked up on Watcher logic 
 With a left-center field indicator gesture gently 
 Smash when the 101-octane hemlock tea pumps chest to extremities 
 And phenom limp it to the wicked recon 
 Prowler fist up with a Bowser twist vs. America's kooky coward clips 
 (Pump breaks, cupcake) I melt through the father formula 
 Goofus murked Gallant, the missing link was apparent 
 Drugstore cowboy, hold floors and grudges 
 Fuck the Judy piece while Elroy burgle space cakes from the cupboard 
 I could kill a cockroach with only Wallabees and rug burn 
 Pin 'em down and funnel up boric acid chuggers if stubborn 
 Mash jackals, hacks flash Bedazzlers 
 Capture flags and crash test happy campers 
 For the typecast ponies grazing through the weekend 
 Ring alarms with bassy kicks that flip whips on the Major Deegon 
 Left out of dodge nauseous (I don't feel good) 
 Yo El, leave the keys to the Delorian with Lauren at the office 
 I peak the 88 streak off with a fiery disposition 
 And basic serotonin deficient symptoms 
  
 [Hook] 
 Alpha uno compute (Aesop) 
 Motor mouth askew at the root (Rock) 
 Brick house, huff, blew the roof 
 Please don't feed the bazooka tooth 
 Evolution super fluke 
 Evolution super fluke 
 Evolution super fluke 
 Please, don't 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 With a kiddy pool full of warm milk, Nyquil and powdered Ambien they found him, trying to drown sheep and count 'em 
 The rowers keep rowing. Pachyderm tranq dart blowgun pressed to the nape of the neck only spent 12 seconds frozen 
 Marathon eye-opener most likely misinterpreted, 'cuz one bad night before the big briefing ain't breached the surface yet 
 Holler dirt merchant... echo out Brooklyn, where the women are beautiful and the vagrants piss crooked 
 This is the sound of one man getting high with one hand in a forest with a tree falling alone... ya heard? 
 Cut rugs to it. Me and my leaky budget nickel-bribe the judges just as a beautiful goose egg motif's adorning the panel's judgment 
 (Overnight Biggies) Overnight Biggies plunk quarters into an A & R Zoltar while the incubated fade collar pop folklore in effect 
 Now they want to mitigate the gusto, that's like asking the cast of Watership Down to fuck slow 
 Homogenized carnies 
 Voodoo lullaby placebo collide zombies 
 Blazing R&B sucker pop lolli fuck spoon futile cartoony maneuvers to soothe roosters 
 Doctor I'm having headaches and pink slip's in my locker 
 My agita needs a walker. (Hey) It's better than Cats! 
 See a grown-ass-man decay to red worm food in house fly years while y'all stable, like all aspiring actors waiting tables 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 So I line 'em up and ask 'em flat... wanna de-worm the belly of this? Orphan bloodlust or timidity? 
 Solidify. Widdle I Aes millipede uncivil. When Millie pulled the pistol that tore the vanilla sky across the middle 
 A billion little crimson pinholes sweat on vintage quill venom developed by a fatal blues anthology 
 Communities on cue bury their ostrich beaks 
 Thought it was carnie mirrors 'til the cold morning stunk the stink of obsolete heroes 
 Hyena for the sci-fi, God barter "non" for hyphen 
 Promo charted phobia specific violence like a 50 foot Bob Barker deployed to incinerate New York, which in a way's more scary than thermonuclear war 
 I got my tongue down Karma's throat. 
 Half a dozen spy cams rigged up in blackmail science 
 Swamp rats back off a destiny that fucks her clients hence the riots 
 You lose, she knew about the tapes and asked for my assistance to clip the biased 
 Lucky sevens buddy up for mass taxidermy 
 Some burn facts and secure camo to past 
 I'm open bodega with ankle anvil pre-shackled out, cancel hackers backwards 'til the death tarot and rains collabo 
 Hope's a broken arrow stabbing blind through the fog in the log cabin, which gathered and hasn't budged since 9/11 
 Give him a couple close friends, a woman in his old bed while he waits. He'll hug it all with no plans to escape[Verse 1] 
 And the saints come marching in 
 Serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population 
 Caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patrons 
 The parody plastered every red brick in site 
 Where had to keep his plights from ticking 
 I'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that 
 Roach on my ceiling circling fins round a bed of pushpins 
 Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth 
 Jaywalking a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passages 
 I'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood 
 Thanks friend, good looking, I'll never see you again 
 Feeding frenzy, catfish stomach, empty oceans 
 Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books 
 And if you're, not gonna eat that 
 Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses 
 Merchant, Goliath dipped in slipshod posture conceived evening 
 So I feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming 
 Oh I'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat 
 Heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note 
 Oh please, I know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction 
 Dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung 
 Skylark litigants strung out like cat's cradle participants 
 I am the trying diaries of a low-life siphon through that feign 
 Anti-diligence movement, here the hunger habitat 
 Working class trash raped where racist hit their high 
 I spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick 
 I witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement 
 And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open 
 The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure 
 Within a token of a moment, restless arrested but not a twerp 
 Strip the vulnerable disclosure, so close yet so much closer 
 I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold 
 Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that 
  
 [Hook] 
 If you'd have only held the cup while I poured 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Back to back to back to stacking a brick match 
 With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap 
 Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back 
 Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages 
 Take one down, pass it round among us 
 Liquor tip a drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest 
 But you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles 
 Naw the carpet turned charcoals amidst skeletons of warlords 
 Snake charmer, hate farmer, gave you the rations 
 With an eyedropper of poison passions hoist above the masses 
 And interrupts homeostasis seeming flow scapes 
 Like asymmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards 
 I'm sleepy, one wing more and I promise to pay homage 
 To those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long 
 Sink or swim, gravel or ascension 
 Even birds of iron combines float if you let them 
 They'll be dodging more than cradles when the bough breaks 
 Note the eviction slip clipped to your little visions into cloud shapes 
 Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face 
 We build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes 
 Sling blades sprayed it with apathy magic balance 
 On the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me 
 Honor find it with monster mashing in text casually 
 On the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction 
 I'm collapsed under the relic rainbow with seven separate 
 Succulent aqua marines hide the imbibed sweetest elixir 
 Star heckler elitists start gawking at yet another 
 Real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture 
 Urgent, the serge is like venom and over kill, kill, kill, kill 
 The over spilled theory's all faucet 
 For real, how many leaves your clover got? Mine's got eight 
 Three for normalcy one for luck four more so you'll spot it from space[Intro: Murs] 
 Hey stupid, you're listening to Bazooka tooth, dental cannons, molar pistols; shit like that 
 This is Murs, motherfucker, this is Aesop Rock, Ace Rizzle. Ya know what I'm saying? Check it out, like, Living Legends, Def Jux, if you don't know, now you're informed 
 Be better prepared for the next time this type of shit goes down. Cause when it's happening and you're unaware you look like a complete asshole 
 (Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums) 
  
 [Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 Every leader dead and it's making you upset 
 La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom

 Every hero dead and it's making you forget 
 Get, get, get

 [Verse 1] 
 I'm in and out a pig channel serrated for hand feeders 
 Army of vicious kitchen patrol yam peelers 
 They sleep in barns and whisper loony conspiracy secrets 
 Increasing payroll awareness blind while a.w.o.l. went the leaders 
 The only mammal officially banned from food chain comp 
 For finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravated 
 Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right 
 And he's up nights 
 Bumping over crunk and bug bites 
 Who luck like this evening? 
 Stay electric mud blood jockeying for the footing 
 My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled Muppet hearts while sheep tuck deep in the wood chipper 
 For the shepherd was a milk carton and scissors 
 Clammy hands make henna run on risky jenga tugs: you're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you! 
 (Holmes!) 
 The muck went abacus on labor perspirator official biz 
 When auditioning demos by which to live 
 No whammies, Stop 
 Your triple six game never chose me 
 Trickery gets hokey 
 Pick up sticks and ponies 
 You've got mail, champ: blow me 
 Just trooper with a question mark machine needy 
 Pointed at the heavens like a Bee Gee on some where the hell's my freebee? 
 To clamp war stupid 
 No landlords or super 
 No hands 
 Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans 
 No motor movement, no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance 
 No chance 
 Too many grown men call in sick over cramps 
 I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick 
 I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pin-up 
 I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch 
  
 (Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

 [Verse 2] 
 Ain't no time to sit and lift stones 
 So it's left to the dogs to find their way home 
 And you grew up in a similar generation alone 
 With a fist full of humanoid models along the road 
 But a blank and you're ancient 
 Fuck if I can find a flesh and bone tour guide to edge me through the makeshift 
 Every little footprint’s faded and vacant 
 Now I stomp through this motherfucker impatient 
  
 For the first time in a long line of dog fights 
 Little Lassie will not be returning home tonight 
 They’re saying someone everclear spiked the punchbowl of Christ but all I saw was six pits ripping throat box out her life 
 Live lizard lung out a this ain’t Kansas cause 
 Where the lemmings run with scissors to the closest open jaws 
 Pause 
 Open the fucking door Hal, it’s your valid mistake 
 I will not bow to a god that I can’t look in the face 
 It go C-4 tongue and a janky ankle 
 He still escort an Eeyore to the seafloor, thank you 
 Please curb your Egor 
 Alto spas Alcatraz to the peace core 
 Anti bleep. Anti sheep 
 Sword anti sheathed for corroded shoulders to lean toward 
 Short ‘em, sort of report consecutive awkward moments like Gandhi and Hitler stuck in elevators broken 
 One could reach the ceiling panel boosted by the other, but suddenly suffocating doesn’t seem all that stubborn 
 Is you with it? It’s brick Timb on eggshell percentages 
 Only mobile at but a trotter’s clip 
 No dial tone or walking stick. Fostered chickies peel back a placenta with broke posture for the daily dun da da’s done didn’t glow proper 
 From the promised land abortion of keepers and bleeding orphans 
 Where only the megas creep outside the box to seize the fortress 
 I and my crew seek an informal enforcement passage after receiving a timeline laced with tutor muter packages. Come on baby, act with us. The other activists, refusing to pour dummy accusations to the aqueducts 
 These are the days when the flotsam and the jetsam part ways trying to convince the players to fuck the game 
 But we don’t want to trouble you 
 We take no for an answer 
 If and only if enhanced with 'k' and 'w' 
 We’re only warning kitten paws who want escorting through the jungle zoo 
 This little industry will buckle you

 You know Aes Rock 
 You know you've been waiting like, how long? 
 You got flow, you're saying he was better back then 
 I've heard this shit it's killing anything he's ever done 
 So shut the fuck up, love it like you know you want to 
 Just don't be a little bitch 
 Little bitches get sniped in their mouth 
 And that's how it happens every time 
 You keep listening because maybe you'll learn something, yeah 
 By the way Can Ox is not broken up, it's just a rumorGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet up! 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Wake up, wake up 
 Ayo Percee P, it's time to wake these kids up 
  
 [Percee P] 
 Word up Aesop Rock, they'd better take their fingers off 
 Pause and hit record 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Is you fat cats or lab rats? 
 Trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks 
 I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city 
 Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, I'm a 
 Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe 
 Sink through the track and think back 
 When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted 
 By every lost child at present 
 Normally I drill pillars of normalcy 
 You're cordially invited to accompany me 
 In rotation of the tables to label the opposition 
 As I choose, refusing to evolve with the cold 
 Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back 
 Brain trip the Beta weights trap for the slaughter 
 Like livestock infected with anthrax 
 On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze 
 Where the bluest ribbons yeilded glory days 
 Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days 
 Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation 
 Slave to idiot box revalations 
 And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers 
 20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases 
 Once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces 
 And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family 
 I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh 
 My mic stabs white flags in drags, trembling 
 Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance 
 Once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites 
 And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress 
 The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock 
 Available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion 
 In 99 brilliant new dimensions 
  
 [Percee P] 
 I'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging 
 50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon 
 Huh, I know this nigga named Rickey his girl Nikki want to get with me 
 Says "Stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie" 
 I stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads 
 One got slick and said I ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead 
 You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides 
 And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes 
 One verse, lung burst, as I done first 
 Guns, slums, hearse don't stun Perce, where I'm from's worse (sucker) 
 My new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot 
 Then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot 
 Stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine 
 Leave you back in time in a ?beeler? still ain't at my prime 
 I'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild 
 I turn the dial, niggas stealing my style 
 I should file for reparations 
  
 "Aesop Rock" "Percee P" *scratched til fade*[Verse One] 
 You replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics 
 Miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions 
 Paragon Pendragon tactician on free-form 
 That uncomfortable, silenced pride of combat cliques 
 That unexpected zephyr, the cyclone shifts 
 Worked up, you're shooken. Jutted to the side 
 I stagger this vagabond wandering minstrel forms your phobia 
 Worst fear. The terror-stricken muted 
 The roots of all evil I've rooted pinnacle 
 Poised with pride pouncing to break your stride, forsaken 
 Agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition 
 My intuition felt you slip up 
 You tripped alone what are you aiming for? 
 Or the useless tries to classify your genus, distorted fetus 
 Evolve, type unsolved, you lack the malediction 
 Malleable martyrs get molded, then folded under pressure 
 Dowsed with scenes of slaughter suspension 
 Bridge over troubled water drown, sound study intensive 
 My square drops to erase your lines like Tetris 
 Relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement 
 Two sticks to burn basics that lie adjacent to my placement 
 On the game board, lunge forward and wind up impaled by the same sword 
 Choose your weapon, stains splattered upon your flag 
 Tattered rag shielding the exterior inferior 
 Stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall 
 Admittedly suspicious of your cadence, your network's on hiatus 
 Permanent, provoked and choked upon the potency 
 The peril be the penetrating agent pierce the insights 
 Why the cold sweats at midnight? Why the dim light? 
 Why are we staring at a truth from the inside? 
 Why the pen slide with vigor on a put down? 
 Like why'd I put my foot down stomp your city 
 A-E-S-O-P scoping through the myrth, opening minds behind the smirks 
  
 [Hook] 
 Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters 
 Babbling brooks with babbling crooks 
 Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters 
 Shallow pools full of shallow fools 
  
 [Verse Two] 
 I've seen misery, I've seen disgust dust ridden ruins 
 Ironclad oracle test recon unit disperse silently 
 Over confidence leads to irony 
 Plot twist foolhardy Icarus shifted in facets of my form 
 Forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side 
 A storm upon the rise, Adam, ire crush come brush upon the red zone 
 Crook you're shook you started poorly 
 Your powers parted pace uncharted territory 
 Disoriented malicious bar you'll burn your bridges 
 This craft requires first drafts 
 Graphs, gritted blueprints of nemesis perimeter 
 Hunting by night compute, twenty one mic salute 
 One life polluted, concerned muffle moans 
 From the nine rings of Donnie's hell burn you in your slumber 
 Sleepwalk then pulled under now 
 Whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden 
 Slipping through the silhouetted skylines Aesop sidewinds jaded 
 Don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion 
 The starving institution broke your mainframe 
 I pose the question, are these waiting games worth it or worthless? 
 While I comb the crowd for clues your naivety hands be my purpose 
 Our planet is the pivotal point 
 In which this network slowly turns to filter kicks 
 We out-box the berserk bewildered by the wilderness 
 My clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush 
 Touch fools that duel with a dominant 
 The evil-minded tried to triple six me but he missed me 
 Intervene; emcees appear as red blips on my color radar screen 
  
 [Hook] 
 Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters 
 Babbling brooks for babbling crooks 
 Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters 
 Shallow pools full of shallow foolsShh...

 (Well or, and this is, New York City) 
 Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door 
 For more and this is New York City 
 (Oh, I see these hear walk 
 I, simply a shade of shepherd 
 Seems we share fate, honestly) 
 Oh, now wait a minute 
 I notice there making mockeries of mad men 
 Tend not to bend in the honesty 
 My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic fatigue 
 (The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply 
 Listeners, how we dissolve its spores and I'll tell you not flying) 
 And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance 
 Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements 
 The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll 
 Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons

 He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up) 
 We tune out the pouts of hiding 
 Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...

 Murder, of holy, in cushion 
 Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall 
 Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you 
 It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained 
 Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond 
 Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different 
 Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker) 
 Traveling up, it only takes one slacker 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity and compliance with time 
 With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries 
 I'm juiced, noosed by the notice, seduced by the ambiance, the motives, and the modus operandi’s 
 I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters 
 Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line 
 My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among 
 Us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus 
 After date rape, and it germs, and I burn for less fortunate starlight 
 Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers 
 Pack a day profess cloud spitter, literate pacifist missed the pissed drunk of concert 
 Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull

 From one to home, one ridiculous tenement with no wings to spread 
 I'm home again inside my box of cardboard daze, I'm thinking of home 
 And I'm home again... 
  
 [Aesop Rock] + (Dose One) 
 (Funny how, faces show up, waters for me, my mouth and snore) 
 It could've been me but it wasn't 
 The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't 
 (These are broken cards given 
 To dues missed of friendly lips tied life is going blank, slap look 
 It's mirrored universe and one god per so many square feet, and 
 Everything counts, higher life forms are dirty, dirty Aesop, every penny 
 Saved, is this the city of dreams?) 
 And I'm down to Earth 
 (I'm down to earth, road) 
 My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns 
 The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages 
 Toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage 
 One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked 
 Worthy well, your with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity 
 Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow 
 Man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly 
 It must have been the dust, the dust, my god, the dust he clutched the 
 Dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness... 
 (Toy, bird, in my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend)Yeah 
 Watch 
 (It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung 
 (It's) The saccharine that the sit on your tongue 
 Fill up his clip-on tie repellant 
 Squeegee to semi-developed 
 While you were sleepin' he's building Rome in his cellar 
 I'm too alive right now 
 The view to which you subscribe 
 Find the key to parry blockage of the cubicle (?) 
 I had a plate of half cooked matters looking at me stupid 
 Fed 'em to the hogs that waddle between the bookends 
 Look, clear! 
 All I gotta do is: 
 Simply make the greatest masterpiece ever conceived by human students 
 Once I am convinced that the kismet inside the labor 
 Is already incredible I might as well ink the paper 
 Hell yes! 
 Easy-peasy, right? 
 Sure. Hey, whatever makes the hazel glaze well 
 I sink teeth deep in to the chart with a fang but for a hark 
 'cuz even silly pink bunnies look scary in the dark! 
 Bang on pots and pans, ring alarm swiftly 
 Cue to bugle turbulent, who salute the worker ant? 
 Duke up to the firmament, overthrow the vapors 
 With a fail-safe method composed by your nosy neighbors 
 Like this: 
  
 Smack dab in the middle of his palms 
 Had a new day victory, ready to evolve 
 Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch 
 To later wake up in the second best seat in the house 
  
 (It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung 
 Except the last digit, pink in your lung 
 What a genius plan, of on a marvel of engineering to rival the great pyramids and cheese in a can 
 He's in a band called "Birds" and it work ? 
 With a root down deeper than the pockets on his doctors 
 So selfishly melt through the piss of Hades 
 As to never note the critics, shake the hands or kiss the babies 
 So the ratings through the chapel roof 
 And snaggle-tooth is focused outside of the jurisdiction of failure among the motives 
 Just when the victory is comfortably assumed 
 You will be woken by the creaky hinge of door number two 
 Door number two, it's sorta like a silhouetted whore in plain view 
 When your homework is due 
 Rhinestone cowboy, nursing his little phenom 
 As an even newer idea poke its head out for recon 
 Oh what a weird distraction, all of a sudden you're lugging separate chapters 
 Original mission is bliss and all 
 But this admittedly is somewhat attractive, even if a little backwards 
  
 Smack dab in the middle of his palms 
 Had a new day victory, ready to evolve 
 Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch 
 To later wake up in the second best seat in the house 
  
 (It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung 
 On second thought, check back when I'm done 
 Just for fun, I know I saw them troubleshooting, and you were so focused 
 Cloaked over the mulish buoyancy in the the dosage 
 So roguish, gloating over the merit and majesty in the moment you chose to own wholeness 
 So bogus the coach is doubting his outing 
 Now the same cellar is littered with Rome's homeless 
 Bang 
 Style of that new sensation seems jealous when it notices the stake's location 
 Brains for a second starts hollerin' ultimatums like, "Your last chicken trippin' on some..." 
 Save it, pick a favorite 
 New car smell, walk like a star, ? my currents at the bar 
 Contradicts every jewel I drop, my apologies but what did y'all expect, school sucks 
 Put a bow on this one, rinse and repeat it 
 So tomorrow I'll actually be my zenith achievement 
 To my heart-of-gold medics with aesthetics on a string 
 You will forever be employed by the next best thing 
  
 Smack dab in the middle of his palms 
 Had a new day victory, ready to evolve 
 Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch 
 To later wake up in the second best seat in the houseKillings reflect the destiny of the village 
 So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage 
 See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain 
 Yea but from here on out its hoof the mare the bare footed urchin 
 Dig it in person 
 Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons 
 And your excused from the round-table admissions committee 
 Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities 
 Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate 
 Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk 
 My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless 
 For fitted boogie systems and crook addictions 
 Well sure my crown is formed of thorns 
 Yea but my thorns are formed of sound 
 And I have found sound will keep me warm 
 When the mornings born with frozen ground 
 Put a rope down pull me from where the buzzards cleared 
 The meat from the bones you and your little bad-ass mad max musketeers 
 When the silhouettes of emaciated frames dance on a high-wire 
 Mistook for aspiring third world poster children 
 But is inserted ghost with dealin' 
 Dead to administer links like chieftain whats your forte 
 Knuckle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes 
 Friend it don't take the wise this minute triplicate pace unified 
 I don't condone the blasphemy naturally its procreation 
 From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones 
 Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hail stones 
 Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons 
 All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room 
 Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums 
 Fuck hugging my cool 
 The edginess readies the Mach 9 quick draw hence the duel 
 The company of similars couldn't excite the motor 
 But hermit crab Ace home alone-uh 
 One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire 
 Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant 
 Stuck in the pluck in the harp buzzing the fuzzing television mixer 
 Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed (sleep on my other half made bed) 
 Pick of the litter, litter of the pick 
 Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom 
 There's ample room 
 Stowaways inside the cargo bed 
 Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet 
 Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms 
 And termite swarms are commonplace 
 I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase 
 I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence 
 But I also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence 
 The nutrients will be [?] circle 
 The clues units of success being personal 
 Then sucked basic diversion 
 Rusty anchor budging for nothing 
 Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern 
 I can't believe I'm still concerned 
 I can't believe sly children turn in their sleep over one-liners 
 While I yield to hear your burns 
 Color me out of my skull draggin' a wagon of creature features 
 And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers 
 Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless 
 Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance 
 Got em out, killing machines turn belly up 
 Buckled, the troubles I've seen 
 Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers 
 Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter 
 Justified the germs birth cauterize the gashes after 
 On my left, one finger for each borough I can touch 
 On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night 
 Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire 
 But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral 
 Born for one task indeed 
 To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed 
 Look I ain't too attired of draggin the baggage over the seasaw seas 
 When the reapers turns mortals to caspers 
 See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimic the null 
 Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons 
 Stand of a many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly 
 Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents 
 In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished 
 Managed to carve initials in the granite wall the damned it all up 
 I hung with cats that do the don'ts 
 Cats that forage through the moats 
 Hoping they open with sovereignty and a canteen deemed with prodigies 
 I love the wake, the watch, the walk, the work 
 The well its almost six o'clock 
 I've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock (watch)[Aesop Rock] 
 Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements 
 Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments 
 Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate 
 Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it 
 There is a brain in the thicket tap circle 
 Cupping the port to accord it 
 Teeter thorn storm plunges more 
 But conformers the pouring's half the entry 
 Plated pearly gates a chanted axis 
 With high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet 
 Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic 
 Lose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants 
 I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion 
 A leader's deception connection 
 Wiper with a barn responds his friend 
 With an eye socket full of needles 
 And a will to die for nothing 
 And that's glory 
 Abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats 
 And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath 
 All aboard that awful train through shames patch 
 Where I'd trade my window seat 
 For one pane of replacement stain glass 
 See I bow to the the gods of opacity 
 I don't mind y'all looking in 
 It's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin 
 And I'm about half way to nausea 
 Half way to contentment 
 2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment 
 Build a pen around Mastodon 
 Patriarch close to four peters 
 Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious 
 Let's soak my feet in lake infinity 
 With a timebomb strapped to dignity 
 Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory 
 Comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck 
 Yet some prefer the hum and 
 Others tend to suck the life out of the crux like 
 [One, two, three, four] 
 And I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry 
 Pull the lever, push the button 
 Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest 
 Target everyone 
 Mechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies 
 'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief 
 Your dreams a needle in a needle stack 
 Claiming safety pin physics 
 Baby tin blizzards collide 
 While ole iron sides, trust the rivets 
 I’m sick of the pick of the litter soaking the spot lit 
 When I know they know they owe all thanks 
 To the end all Aesop Rock shit, watch this 
 Oh, build me a home 
 Build me a home of brick and wood and everything good 
 With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night 
 And smoke stog's till the day meets twilight 
 Build me a home 
 Build me a home with a green grass hill with running water 
 In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers 
 Build me a home 
 With a basement and an attic 
 Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in 
 Build me a home 
 No skull is sacred in the races 
 Locked in a pagan doctrine 
 Watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant 
 Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community 
 Harking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops 
 Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss 
 On the least common attachment 
 Ten seconds of blaring silence 
 Pilot is flight redefine stagnant 
 Most emotions host an entire lesson 
 Congressional, less one 
 Stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now 
 Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed 
 Where the straight and narrow’s a perfect circle has-beens 
 Fastened to the flip side via migrating clusters 
 That's better than colony 
 My own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology 
 High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life 
 Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates 
 Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river 
 A quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue 
 I put my hook in the pond 
 I put my worm in the hook 
 I put my trust in the worm 
 That he'd bring me something to cook 
 I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can 
 On my pole with a note from the worm attached that 
 Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!" 
 Simple parables of nature making character giddy 
 And riddle me a similar situation mid city 
 Quick, put your honor on the line 
 Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and 
 Report on powers of devil treatment church links 
 I'm a fence sitter 
 Lips torn by both polars and their working 
 I can only model throttle at the dream catching 
 Matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty 
 Harbored and charged by hate breed anonymity spigot 
 Spitting stitches to fix the bridges and the gaps 
 One night I broke in 
 Bridges give us traps and 
 Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps 
 And I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath 
 Making that classic mockery of every step 
 Oh, build me a home 
 Build me a home, please, with a light in the window 
 And a red front door and a picket fence 
 And a fire place and a sturdy frame 
 And we can sit and I'll tell you my name, build me home...[Intro - Orson Welles] 
 Thou mayest indeed 
 Tune onto the forbidden channel 
 And see it like it is baby 
  
 *Record Scratch in* 
 Who shall be our champion? 
 What manner of channel beholdest thou 
 Shall it fall on me? 
 Deceit, deceit, deceit 
 *Record Scratch out* 
  
 "Getting dusty in the cellar" 
  
 [Verse 1 - Aesop Rock] 
 Yo 
 I always think about my sick friend 
 Stringing a ring around my wit's end 
 Thirteen loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen 
 Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness 
 With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance 
 Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier? 
 To capture the fascist fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels 
 Hooked like sickle cells to the principles of comradery 
 One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample 
 Divvy the bread crust while considering the littering 
 I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill 
 Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst 
 Sprung alacritive, leashed by the carnal tirade 
 I choked when the cage bird sings it stings 
 Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings 
 I sink instinctively brinked through while clinging the shrieking souls 
 Mourning the death of annal logs /analogs and quality control 
 Quality control, stand still string up the banner 
 From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy 
 Incorporate the unison of Vikings Ship Rowers PLUS the perfection 
 Of the twice the Birds with half the Stone Throwers, speak your assessment 
 My communicative hindrance pleads the needs 
 Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's left to splinters 
 Shiving up the mass of natives and it's league marvels 
 One component's sure to shock a mass burial, breeze 
 Broken penny bank fragments float up at staggered seas 
 Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease 
 Iron bandit, give them the stars, the head balloons and rubies 
 Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more 
  
 (Orson Welles) 
 Is that how I feel when I sling? 
 And the regulars were so amazed 
  
 *Record Scratch in* 
 I'm the mightiest slinger of them all! 
 There is a time for war and a time for peace 
 And a time to run and a time to split 
 *Record Scratch out* 
  
 "Getting dusty in the cellar" 
  
 [Verse 2 - Aesop Rock] 
 I run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy admirals 
 Where 99.9% swear by their broken axles 
 I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung 
 Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it 
 Lopsided starboard bow, crooked mass makeshift 
 Patching holes with chewing gum and sticking sail to dirty bases 
 Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, Cause 
 I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock 
 And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension 
 Of blue sky over happy neighborhood 
 String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature 
 Merry etiquette is a door nail, Friends is little brittle dolls of paper 
 In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile 
 Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry 
 Now if I, were to fall to speeds 
 To levigate the game plan, would you honestly impede? 
 I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest 
 And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess 
 But my loyalty supply hints on which inkling I should run with 
 And I'm thinking that damn town crier's about to fill this here bucket 
 It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch 
 And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with 
 Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments 
 Mood swinging upon the barnstorm with perpendicular traffic 
 Spread, Circa 4000 circuitry burns cicada wings 
 Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow 
 I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio 
 It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?) 
  
 [Outro - Unknown man] 
 It is the molotov cocktail hour 
 Haven't I brought you blessings without number? 
  
 *Record Scratch in* 
 They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them 
 Yea 
 I've never had it so good 
 *Record Scratch out* 
  
 "Getting dusty in the cellar" x3Once upon a time in the days of yore 
 When the people lived fresh out of legend and folklore 
 There was an old geezer with his teeth to the curb 
 He had a hook and a line and a sinker and a worm 
 Slept in a city that kissed the seashore 
 Woke with a bait-and-tackle store trip each morn 
 Not a bother, not a lot to say 
 That is until you ask about the one that got aw-w-w-way 
  
 Like a tall tale, keep it rod and reel 
 With his arms stretched out to define the kill 
 While the village always listened, believin' it was different 
 Out of eight million stories there was not a single witness 
 It was always at the last second when the line snapped 
 Or the boat broke in half from the size of the catch 
 Either way the documented proof didn't exist 
 So the locals dismissed the big f-f-f-fish 
  
 Billy-goat beard twenty years in the making 
 Carried lures in his brim, carried beer in his waders 
 Stinked like alcohol of all prominent flavors 
 Carried knives in his vest, carried war in his nature 
 Sat among the forest floor critters and pine cones 
 Could tie a perfect fly with his eyes closed 
 Veteran angler with a mission to run 
 Make all naysayers hold t-t-t-tongues 
  
 Pale blue moon or fiery orange glow 
 Red sky at dawn or rain, hail, sleet, snow 
 Black storm cloud with the barometric horrors 
 The weatherproof sportsman spins yards regardless 
 Laugh if you wanna, but the dude ain't stupid 
 Let it roll off his back like drizzle off plumage 
 Cause he woke with a twinkle in his eye 
 And every dog has his day and today is m-m-m-mineAlright, I can hear the ocean in a shell 
 But for the life of me I've never heard your surges more than raindrops in a well 
 Paladin tribe 
 Break beat elitists 
 Element five 
 Fully sold on operation, jeopardize of my survival 
 I will survive when sprayed by heavens liquid ammunition 
 I'll survive when betrayed by my brethren's wicked ambitions 
 I'll survive when braided with shuteye sticky thickets and thorns 
 Born clutching a fistful 
 The hurt's morbidly blissful 
 Forms spiraling 
 Sovereigns bring the rise in the funnel 
 A chorus line of blind crazes tap the water, find the tunnel 
 As skinny click, mechanics flock to block pick of the land 
 We stretch the Earth around the canvas 
 Drag a stick in the sand 
 And pan the hell out 
 Timid, you're tireless, bold 
 The cold that ire spits clicks subtly on supremacy therefore blemishe me 
 Oh, the treacherous penalty centers me, renders me bait 
 Skating slalom through this churning murder columns 
 I am not entirely trained to undo the shame 
 And all I got's three pennies and a rusty mic unto my name 
 Unto my game, defy the siamese approaches 
 Whose delinquent dichotomy comps Emerald City in wondrous novelty 
 Drink drum, sip a snare to spit a rigid sequence 
 That's when freak sons fade to black just like these pretty pink lungs, slugger 
 Paper dolls facade as swash buckler 
 Bounty hunt the front to document the frosh cluster 
 I am structure with a smoke ring, militant distinction 
 With a cloak-and-dagger stagger prime directive 
 And all else burrows itself amongst drunken perspective, fade me 
 I flee the scene grippin' the missing link like chain gang escapees 
  
 Build me, kill me 
 We cadets hold determination as property undeniably divine 
 We leak passion for the noise 
 There is not a track to cherish from he who lacks merit 
  
 And all I think about's the motion 
 Exerted to color mavericks alerted 
 Herd a billion nervous lost child prodigies home to flourish 
 Now taciturn facets burn open to yield malarkey 
 Navigator when wrestled on fancy driftwood out the vessel 
 And I settle 
 A conquest, stamp it, label it fresh 
 I in turn apply policies which require intrinsic merit 
 Try to wallow down these yellow bricks with yesterdays appendix on hold 
 Spot it like sky horizon, posed as barcodes 
 Load your fantasy 
 Interject a bad dream candidly 
 Blue in the face, through in the chase between myself and fame's embrace 
 Face engaging presence resonant with 
 Chiaroscuro atmospheric traps 
 Inhabit the land of denied clearance 
 Pigeonholed styles, drop similar 
 The course the corpse patients 
 Lacing non sequitur's that spittle off the chin 
 Upon the recognition pilot soften up the grin 
 Spinning me dizzy, cold 
 Bending my city to hold water 
 Yeah, we got affiliates, cadet merit and brilliance 
 Cleric apparel king-thing, crooked, I shrink, I sink into my book 
 It's like fury blew the scaffolding askew and tainted curiosities 
 Allow the freak show to continue 
 Forty thieves who seaved the cuehen commence blending a plan 
 And decorate the dusk like henna to hand 
 We unknowingly sketched the pentagram by sending clans of caffeinated couriers upon a quest to run the perfect circle around a star 
 Bizarre pattern with a bad vibe like Jafar to Aladdin 
 Pardon the carbon-based blaze amongst the stagnant trend frenzy 
 It offends me 
 Wait, ain't it the liquid soul therapy? 
 I sip to grip a stationary pillar 
 Yet we slipped these boogie nights 
 Sucked wattage from rookie lights 
 Now you proud 
 I'mma be there when you rush in 
 Just to touch the mushroom cloud 
 Drink failure 
 Lord have mercy on their dreams 
 Pretty pixels tend to trickle off the screen 
 Know what I mean? 
  
 Build me, kill me 
 We consider fresh sound play to sink frighteningly close to extinct 
 My life line is an assignment to feed the arts my spirit and bleed merit 
  
 The conclusion is subtle 
 Huddled amongst hermetic gutter-bugs 
 Peasants, and drunks 
 Junkies to critics 
 Sick dictators, haters 
 Kings to alley urchins 
 Monarchs, narcs to liars 
 Circling the wild fires 
 Live wires 
 I tend to blend an action less than orderly in 
 With an otherwise uncommonly primer to normalcy torn 
 These traits fade as cadavers due to conflicting data matter, first heard as remarkable's now labeled as unmarketable 
 Damn, thorn in my side 
 Now the high five hives despised from freeing demating alien seedlings, retreating 
 Burst the threshold, make the vessel capsize 
 Then the hollerings of buoyant survivors treading awoke dreaded leviathan 
 Deaded 
 Headed to crunch the world of MC etiquette 
 By dismantling mics prior to passing towards degenerates 
 How do you like that settlement? You feel that? 
 A maverick like myself bottles, will quit 'til the cocoon naturally peels back 
 This little light of mine shines at a hundred billion times the magnitude of every star 
 Within an ample sky sample 
 I alerted 
 My sole crusaders 
 To trade the games; 
 Prescribed them strict diets of DDT and Kelthane 
 It fester when ingested 
 Glorious vellum 
 Addressing helots to zealots 
 To Jezebel's to hellish felons 
 Granted my span of attention is not what it used to be 
 But most of y'all delinquents ain't amusing me no more, kid, merit[Aesop Rock] 
 Pain cave uno 
 Smokin' a broken Blue Note 
 Tar pit escape artist carcass, linger in the bulldoze 
 Rose radio Lazarus via linear bark screaming 
 "I'm back to kill the video star and I'm double parked" 
  
 [Sonny Cheeba] 
 You can kite this or yet maybe baby you won't 
 Corvette, green Mercedes, steady one hundred four 
 When I'm stuntin', simply stunnin', funkin' with twenty monkeys 
 They can be like "I'm talkin' about WE" 
 Slap that orangutan, drop her on her knees 
 Please be very cautious, the funkin' makes me nauseous 
 Hate the Bogota, the target it ain't off it's...right here 
 And the volume's on three 
  
 [Geechi Suede] 
 See, we keep the black plastic stuck in the elastics 
 Even Chevy's heavy hallows lift you higher, legend has it 
 White crows crossing broken bridges 
 Double deucy clickin' but the round never runnin' out 
 Pounds of your blood just comin' out 
  
 [Hook] 
 We limelighters 
 Up until the uglier unplug me 
 We limelighters 
 Kill it now, fade to black comfortably 
 Spark the dynamite till the limelight's gone 
 As far as I can see the limelight stays on 
 And on and on and on 
 The limelight stays on and on and on 
 The limelight stays on and on and on 
 The limelight 
 So we got something built if we all die tonight 
  
 [Sonny Cheeba] 
 She think she piss champagne and shit caviar 
 Don't watch the stars, the stars ain't fallin 
 Any sight of glimmer...Lo 
 Shimmering king, spring, they're tremb-ling 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 OK, the web (web) spread (spread) from Brooklynites to born in barn kittens 
 Who's gimpy half step hid behind Noah's Arc systems 
 Inconspicuously clustered with the boas, sharks and pigeons 
 Like Zoo York won't clock them rusted crutches up mopping the ship deck 
 Texas hold 'em pocket ace investment 
 Totem altimeter tiki torch it 
 Freak abort, fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress 
 That's a sheep corpse who under penumbra turned tail like a sea horse 
  
 [Geechi Suede] 
 We got that...permanent ink, that's stainin' the paper 
 Murderer's drink steamin' my soul, I'm breathing green vapors 
 We them last of them falcons that's soarin' beyond your altitude 
 Please show us some gratitude, we're carvin' your grave for you 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 16 D batteries, bag it up 
 See the halflings flee the Shire before he tore open the packaging 
 Plus, minus, in proper Panasonic alignment 
 Pseudo Pliskins O.D. on kick drums 
 Snake, escape THAT environment 
  
 [Geechi Suede] 
 Wave that colt .44 
 Bolts of lightning with Travolta grease 
 Strip your skeleton, it's swelterin' inside Miami Heat 
 Your fishnet and red vette are sizzling 
 Shoot through chocolate city 
 Wonder Woman went whistling 
 Freeze, presidential sleaze with Egyptian cuts 
 Valentine Ave., Jack Daniels out of them plastic cups 
 Winter white pinstripe lookin' Hugo 
 Poison Ivy out the windpipe blowin' the crucial 
  
 [Sonny Cheeba] 
 First they line up 
 We'll divide them 
 Suede get the Roscoe, then design 'em 
 Aesop Rock box, drop the hot rod getaway car 
 And head up the rock highway 
  
 [Hook][Intro Sample - "Heavyweights" by Freestyle Fellowship] 
 Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire 
  
 [Verse I] 
 The sound of silence vers' the sound of War 
 Echo death shock-renegade 
 Crooked cynic tyrant 
 Your ignorant bias is my Goliath 
 Starving alliance seeps under the skin 
 The seven deadly sins 
 That’s the seven elements of the malevolent 
 The relevance of 
 Graphic endeavors 
 Drastic measures took for defense 
 My secrets unfold codes of conduct, raid 
 Blade runner, intimidating 
 Figment in the minds of the malignant 
 Your opinion: not significant, bludgeon 
 Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted 
 Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks 
 Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished 
 Vanished in gritty streets til' city seeks, sleep, head, rush 
 Scope, infra-red touched 
 Temple's the torment 
 Pressure point contact 
 Crush the dormant with missing links 
 Syncopate movement, Our trobbled blockade ends but I’m blemished in the blueprint 
 Behold of the hideous 
 Some assaulted by the anthems of the lesser 
 Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure 
 Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages 
 Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten 
 A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded 
 Ese's hunger for upper handed plan strategy: strike force 
 Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams 
 A portrait of pillage 
 Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception 
 Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon 
 The unbearable weight 
 Contaminate little thieves 
 Heaves, breath, the last gasp 
 And I last grasp, but trace through your trickery, pinpointed 
 Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle 
 Ya’ll spinnin if you tread before you think 
 The center of my web is pen and ink 
 It’s the merciless, masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs 
 Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists 
 The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs 
 Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists

 Dear Colleague 
 I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter 
 It really does seem quite out of character 
 Although I have to admit it is quite funny 
 Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor 
 But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame 
 It really... 
  
 [Verse II] 
  
 All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters 
 Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms 
 Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore 
 It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for 
 My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding 
 Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt 
 All through flood fire and drowning all tied rapidy into humid winds 
 Lucid lens bend vigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays, I prayed for days lacking discoloring (????) 
 Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks (????) 
 Walkers cross Battle-stars I travel far my radar flips 
 Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone 
 I try to spring clones leaving em like tendrils, that require 
 More than a click-click five 
 While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles 
 Gathered in gutters 
 Type B-negative whirlpool 
 I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture 
 As still in dreams while empires fall apart 
 He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart 
 I'll never know of you 
 Emotion reads close encounters I run 
 The last classic example of a love of mic and sample 
 Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory 
 Not a question of should I 
 But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources 
 Crafted by supreme forces 
 Seemingly dream catcher 
 Aesop Rock computer Hacker! 
 See you lack a dispatch to request back up 
 Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher russian robot recruits 
 We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude 
 I am waterfall 
 I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls 
 Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'

 [Sample: Mike Batt - "Whispering Fools"] 
 This young man is clearly a genetic throwback 
 He seems to be experiencing primeval urges and feelings which frankly 
 Unless we can terminate will contaminate others 
 And threaten entire structure of our society...[Verse I] 
 You look like you were charmed out of a basket 
 Slack jaws clap straw homes 
 Hit the piggy in the clapper claw zone 
 Each a little Isaac Asimov 
 Actually down to accurately whack-a-mole 
 And get the taxidermy cataloged 
 With or without this bag of bones on my back 
 I'll be honest, I let a goat eat the map 
 Still agree to bleed a birthstone 
 Even if alerted to the dirt throne 
 Freely by your tentacles squeezing into a turncoat 
 Yikes, inertia days and vertigo nights 
 It's when a batch of falling gavels blur the vertical stripes 
 You ain't a leader among 
 You're a bottom feeder eating his young 
 We'll see who's teething when the beef is expunged 
 Unless it shrivels up around us in the caving wake of daylight 
 But more likely you slither off into the closest drainpipe 
 Miffed, other insiders are finding solace 
 Thought it wasn't ever in our quarters hoarding shiny objects 
 Degree in beeswax never personal 
 Which by the way have grown exponentially indiscernible 
 Behind a picture in the wall or at the local pissing hole 
 Where desperate images sully every second an empty coat 
 I'm gonna guess you probably know everything I could ever tell you 
 Plus a tiny bit more 
 That's what you're for 
 And you never met a button that you ain't push 
 Or a sucker that you ain't mush 
 Or a mother fucking butcher 
  
 [Bridge / Hook] 
 The, the, the butcher 
 The, the, the, the, the cleavers know exactly where to put you 
 The, the, the butcher, the, the, the butcher, the, the butcher knife 
  
 [Verse II] 
 When out of focus go the handlers 
 Answer to the hammerheads that camp under the scrambler box 
 Swam off with a plaque for mounting antlers on 
 Outpost scanners 
 Of a yellow desert peppered with cow skulls and cameras 
 Down fall the phantoms 
 And a tale drawn long by a crown full of raw flawed canvas 
 You should see the cough cough annex 
 And D-up when your lullabies are peaking 
 For the succubi that fawn over a good commandment breaching 
 Alright sleeping 
 25A, feeder full of chicks on horseback 
 Sailor Moon roof spewing horn hats 
 Born to corner any harrowing defector 
 Vector, through a delicate series of tech gestures 
 Check, hood on my hair, foot on my neck, food in my trough 
 Stewing the nuances of hooligan law 
 Ran reds like a primed gazelle, priced to sell 
 Because these window sill pies don't heist themselves 
 From the tucker, home of the dozen bee sting summer 
 Don't let them see your gills blushing seaweed color 
 Chum, this little medium is dominant social predator fun 
 It's really grown folks coming undone 
 But um, I'm gonna guess you probably thought this all before me 
 But better and with a more elite view 
 That's what you do 
 And you never met a button that you ain't push 
 Or a sucker that you ain't mush 
 Or a mother fucking butcher 
  
 [Bridge / Hook]I saw them, they're out there man 
 Monsters 
  
 [Aes:] 
 Misanthropes puff tuff, buck up at your pigeonholes 
 Normal Christian home at a distance behind his picket rows 
 I was on a double yellow line 
 Beached with a Lilliputian army to suffocate and divide 
 Suicide kings on the 495, do the math, do or die, never knew to chew the fat 
 Do his upturned, diamondbacks max flicker 
 The only shutter speed he ever had to shoot his thriller was 
 Winter 88, baby made a nest out of stories of Babylon and galactic unrest 
 Caddy stack of rumors on the shoeless express 
 Where you could read your epitaph before your foot even slips 
 And I keep adding to this Rube Goldberg 
 Mechanism after wacky mechanism loaded and holstered 
 They operate accordingly, every bell and whistle had a trigger 
 But not an ultimate goal to compose toward Amigo 
 Study the mother of all Blitzkriegs 
 Shoulda kept the lambs and lions in split screens 
 Bitch please, panic will divide the herd at the vital nerve 
 Drivers who tidy and Firebirds, I emerge 
 Hayday like a symphony arranged in melee attacks 
 Wake em where the mayday is at 
 And when he stood up on the ledge where the pigeons guard the eggs 
 His brain hollered jump while his dark heart said 
  
 I walked through fire and did not get burned (x8) 
  
 These are the slings and arrows that sing carols on Arcadian rain 
 They're honeycombing kings and cowards the same 
 Not exactly Sunny D and school plays 
 Fluffernutter, baby carrots more akin to pacing parent doomsday 
 Circle of abrasive parrots placed inside a room stay to 
 Duplicate the moves made, say form of lazy on some gladly pay you Tuesday 
 Two would follow suit into the crew suede 
 But you would rather lose it all than mutate 
 Weapon revvin up, worms through your segments up 
 Bedlam as the leper section bed off through the lapel chump 
 And you were sweating bullets on some irony is golden 
 With no commitment issues in the moment 
 Itchy finger crispy when a morning you were open 
 Spin of liquors frozen ill of fortune down from any chamber chosen 
 And when it clicked instead of banged 
 The little breath that fled his fangs 
 Was drenched in the belief that you had hoped no one had noticed 
 But--this is not a competition of the damned 
 All Plebs broil equally, no idiosyncrasies 
 That secretly would climb up out of the silver foil 
 Where the skippys pitter-patter past the sleeping killers coil 
 One man dogs playing poker yoke a harpy up 
 One hand on his heart like his bubble juice pocket car key tuck 
 One long mile of dog fence 
 Got him kicking a hornets nest until the sidewalk ends 
  
 I walked through fire and did not get burned (x8)

 Puff Tuff 
 Puff tuff[Verse 1] 
 APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED! 
 Yeah, yeah, I recall the 
 First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a 
 "Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon," 
 When a dust mite harbored spite it barely 
 Dents the cicada phase, blades averted 
 Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those 
 Steeples higher, man the loose cannons 
 "Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with 
 "Push" stamped on their hand lets 
 Push, let's push up through the 
 Now, let's evoke a vow of 
 Zipped lips clipped to my peaking 
 Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished 
 Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a 
 Third to her broken promises 
 Black spot of Gotham, fragile 
 Castle and master passageway 
 Even the innocent captives bleed 
 Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding 
 Hassle factor's feet 
 Pin the tail on the village idiot 
 Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the 
 Modes of neurotic nitpicking 
 Patrons and their pseudo potent 
 Patronage, ahh mood of the moment 
 Gloated in splendor of its 
 Greatness and I'm hella swamped 
 Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness 
 Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding 
 I'll one up you with love letters from despondency 
 Honestly appleseed.. 
 Yeah!When you see my foot rapidly tapping upon the floor boards you should take it as my not being amused with the display 
 When you feel my finger rapidly tapping upon your skully you should pack a bag with food and clothes and walk the other way 
 It's now for the crumb bloodhound serendipity movement 
 Alien a triplicate stooge counter culture 
 Forty first thief dispatchee, they shake a stick at 
 My fins break water circling shoulder chips dipped in a well to rape the origin 
 Fresh sneaker bows idle all killin' 
 Day tripping I beaker spillin, right? 
 I treat the cursed burners of my Zen like pendulums and let 'em count the seconds 'til the big hand strikes to scissor clip the string in your box kites 
 I got that thousand yard stare 
 'til the hounds howl 
 Jackal walker stripped the market bare 
 Dig it, it's all modern logistics 
 See, the slaves work for assholes, and the assholes work for kings 
 And the kings work for hookers, cocaine and forefinger rings 
 Snake tongue, hung a rung above the rest 
 Lung while I pink lung stung and sunk to an ebony vest 
 Bad spirit 
 Fad pyramids rust in the shadows of this cat on a hot tin something 
 Spittin disgusting 
 Ready to rain 
 Indian summer under a fragile pain comforter 
 Stain glass palace 
 Brain gas baggage 
 Sum of separate pieces equals freight class imbalance on a palette made a snake bones 
 Graf' work, A poem 
 Kill 'Em All 
 Yeah jig, I'm awful with aesthetic 
 Mach 20 (30, 40, 50...) 
 Why money, what you up to? 
 "Oh, I was just about to, uh..." 
 Trying to graduate to gum shoe 
 Here to preach the great American fuss feud, so fuck you 
 Aesop rock dropped his lip to floor 
 Shoved the mile stones in his mouth, chewed 'em up and spit the core 
 So the captains of the slapstick handshake trade embargo 
 Crunched on a fortune cookie tomorrow opening question marked parcels 
 I absorb bliss for the futures modern samaritans 
 By exposing the vain roots of the hear-us-now plain troops 
 But I won't 
 Life lessons curdle in the stomach prior to sink into the sense capsules 
 As discipline fractals 
 Now 'course necessities says let the brain jolt awkward 
 Set it free 
 Just take note if your walk's irrelevant 
 Excuse me, for example if Moses had gills he could have fished without the split-sea macho circus 
 But he didn't and it don't really make a difference 
 I'm cooked 
 I've been around the universe twice 
 The first time I sat and looked 
 The second time I broke the galaxy 
 Now I walk with a limp cause my foot's coated in casualties 
 A small price to pay for a life of, "Greetings, your Majesty" 
 Spread a billion apple seeds to honor his vision of underprivileged children 
 Plucking the fruits in their ripest hour 
 But the dreams have gone sour 
 Cowards dug up the roots 
 Weaved the leaves, hung up a noose and sacrificed their freedom vouchers 
 He did it in the name of Christ 
 She did it for the grunt work 
 He did it for the star cluster that he'd named after his mother 
 Now it's touching, and it makes a great story to tell 
 But I'd rather be the wisher than the penny in the well 
  
 Kill one, kill a few, kill 'em all 
 Fill 'em all with guilt 
 Watch them pray while you walk around stilts[Now hear this]

 Metropolitan grab bag apocalypse 
 Maggot patch is swallowing the traps baddest columnist 
 Big vision, tiger soul, anonymous alacrity, and pulse 
 Held together by a beached bucket of bolts 
 I’m here to bleach masker lust and touch false allegations 
 Where the born-agains and pagans claim the same corner store pavement (pavement) 
 Silence and the needle pin hybrid 
 Bought you this reflecting pool to school you on my underlying bias 
 Now if 
 I polish off the poison with a sip 
 I know my orphanage massive will help you lift my casket; 
 With the drip of this B-positive and ominous last cackle 
 Bury me beneath the cherry tree bough and run for the castle 
 (I'm one propaganda) 
 I'm one propaganda speech ahead of televised 
 Recognize-life-cycler, too deep to stop and decipher 
 We cross-section a vision every genius dreams 
 Something obscene with 
 Syncopated, simultaneous land speed achievement 
 (drench) 
 Drench! river-dance your way through bed and breakfast 
 Blemished predetermined destiny checklist (but first check this) 
 Well I was born upon a swiftly tilting galleon 
 Circling sloppy pseudo stick paddock pity-me sound system servers (oh god) 
 We the dicky-dawn left handed scribbles of god 
 Approached gruesome by drunk buddy system two-somes 
 One attacked sternum turned to vaporized minor (c'mon) 
 The second in turn circled to confirm the fertilizer 
  
 And I'm one of a small tribe camped in a rubber stamp facility 
 With best friends like utility who needs these instabilities of mind 
  
 You wanna hold that grudge that's fine 
 In fact let's both hold grudges just to see who's stubborn and who budges 
  
 Well I'm the stubbornest bastard this side of 4 dimensions 
 And I'm here to build this picket fence around your frigid lenses 
  
 I ain't ever known a potion as potent as zen to mend a broken friendship 
 I'm saying don't get defensive

 And I hear you recognize the jeopardy 
 Finally 
 Shepherd me 
 Honoring the touch of pure peasantry I've been harboring presently 
 Tough as nails, tough enough to sail through broken ballads 
 With a pinch of foul demeanor inching forward through your outlets (fuck that) 
 Fuck that, I grease burden incredible NOW! 
 Couldn't even offer concept minimum wage let alone benefit grace 
 Wait wait wait, let's pick all paper dolls, line 'em in size order just to gaze in amazement upon a short fuse getting shorter 
 (getting shorter) 
 Basic upheaval laced with logical absurdities (c'mon) 
 Stolen promise lacking witness to the burglary 
 I'm sharp 
 See yesterday I seen upon the target face your bargain basement dream attached with thumbtacks, so I arched 
 Boogie bulls-eye upon that dim excuse for group effort triple thin oxidized box cutter lost lamb ecosystem, drippin on my person 
 You see my version of ruler don't include underlings thumbing through yellow pages for a future 
  
 Today I strike a match adapt tragedy 
 Tomorrow humankind's logic pistons crash and burn 
 The next day procreation becomes annual formality 
 I guess it's once a kid, always a kid 
 It's just some kids'll never learn 
  
 I pack my bags and steadily trudged out the door 
 Off to secure my legacy in bread and water blizzards 
 I couldn't feed the masses with more fishes 
 Yeah but I can force-feed em wishes 
 And I'd rather be hungry for desires than bloated and tired (bloated and tired) 
 It goes keen cohorts condense at high noon 
 To force every rattlesnake to beat the dead horse (horse) 
 Aesop Rock, premiere dysfunctional grief citizen 
 Of course, I'm headstrong, but even stronger in support 
 Man I've been there done did this and that (Aight?!) 
 I've been the engine all the way down to the railroad spike 
 It isn't pretty, walked in sober, staggered out dizzy 
 Take this lesson as a key to that life mystery

 Spit more rounds than Bruce Willis flicks 
 Ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes 
 Supplied with step this God did years ago to grasp a taste 
 Have to place them in a glass case and observe 'em from a Nasa space center with a mask on face 
 Coward of the year make others fear the way this brother is empowered

 Sadly I withered a non-believer 
 When pride covered this must lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth 
 Form the frame of your demeanor 
 I address but a rapidly lessening portion of majors 
 Dissolved in the abortion of creations new laborers 
 Pilot burner riddle of trades, divinity, composers 
 And tunnel through and out of spite the anti hero dosage 
 In a cradle I label the dreaded simulation we compile 
 Tenets embedded within synthetic inclination 
 We have never dined on bait so when corrupt crooks 
 Hook simple Samaritans' eyes buried in books 
 Shift on a badda datta sun moon merger to guard the difference

 An angel gets its wings with every blue note I release? 
 Could this be lies? Cause I'm gonna spit cobalt 'til every angel fly's 
 I blew the operation set to clinch victor 
 Walkie talkers turn awkward fixtures to complete the wicked mixture

 Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go 
  
 All day 
 We was all 'ay' 
 Hopefully everybody lands okay 
 All night 
 We was all nice 
 Hats in the air, no more thin ice 
 All day 
 We was all 'ay' 
 When will the knots in the stomach go away? 
 All night 
 We was all nice 
 Victory swole at a roll of the dice

 [Verse 1: MF Doom] 
 I can stop any time I want to 
 Famous last words that came back to haunt you 
 All your life, like permanent dried tears 
 Some cats get it like no bright ideas 
 He broke the record then bowed 
 Said he couldn't do it without the crowd, for crying out loud 
 Even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene 
 And drop a lot before he was out, in the time machine 
 A lot of rappers are drama queens (buddy dutty ?) 
 When they come to the mic, I'm a feel ya's. (buddy buddy ?) 
 Fuck around and get your title took, cut and dry 
 He doesn't lie, even like who and where, what and why? 
  
 Hold it like a cue a button, button fly (boom boom) (?) 
 Once they leave the room, they be like, Doom! Doom! Doom! 
 It's no use. Blessed to design 
 And the villain has left the building, dressed to the nines 
 Like, I'ma do mine. Ya'll do yours 
 He stay reppin' the game like Lou Rawls 
 The super MF villain, feelin' like two balls 
 For the microphone, he joins like two falls. (?) 
 Well we'll see after these criminals who falls 
 A lot of ya'll is reminiscent of Rupaul 
 Ball to ball and we'll be needing new drawers 
 Drawers, the one-twos that run through walls

 [Verse 2: Aesop Rock] 
 All in it together now 
 Some of the misadventures of a father crop 
 My provider chop's flashin' 
 See, I'm a stop that gut reaction 
 Bound to tackles when a battle runs in circles 
 Like rodeo clowns with paddles 
 Poked in the belly by petty sarcasm 
 Gentlemen, start your laugh tracks 
 Push pins for the lab rat breed 
 All I wanna be is a fat cat sleeping 40 nights (nights) 
 In hopes that when I rise 
 The hacker mass will have seen there's more to life 
 Let's recreate a perfect service rooted in labor lust 
 And a discipline prisoner 
 I don't work a thick antithesis 
 Parallel park your burning prod adjacent 
 To the flagrant iron ego valve 
 Let us study a weaker outlet 
 I found peace (I found peace) 
 I found peace, it tap me on the shoulder 
 Asking where's the closest war and how to make it sleep 
 I pointed toward the exact place my sneakers met the credence 
 Said If I could answer questions (who), I would be relief 
 Now classify don't got em shook by exposing the skeletons 
 Yeah I sorta stick to a more murky-hurt development 
 Some of these kids are spittin' just a bit too delicate a thesis 
 If only Yeah, but holy jumpin' Jesus! 
 I get torn swiftly from a planet while it tilts, 23 
 Look buddy, we've gotta talk 
 God made me a fine instrument of style 
 Zig zag zisfiss? 
 Don't make me holy sleep bolts blindly until your mood shifts 
 Now here comes 40 acres of congruence pistons 
 Purple skeleton key immunity systems 
 Aw, it'll be something incredible 
 See, I know the limit 
 That's why I do my best to stay quiet 
 Whenever I ain't spittin' the gimmick

 Who stole the cypher slayers, who buffed the train? 
 Who stole the mixtapes, who stole the fame? 
 Who stole the cypher slayers, who buffed the train? 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Barnacle on the hull of show business 
 Vote for auto dead horse battery 
 Murder perfect world Gerber Baby ecosystem 
 Army green eyes with ColecoVision bash casually 
 While punks jump up and jeopardize my head banger reality (ah) 
 Godzilla jook 
 Red five minus the whiny Wookiee 
 Gobble gromits with a jaw that swivels backwards off the hinges 
 Mollasses [?] on plastic fabric with a cause 
 That riddles bastard coughs with ribbons 
 Nerve-wracker that pivots 
 As a dysfunctional dancer in the dark 
 My smart bomb mechanism ticks adjacent to the broke city 
 Art yester-vision 
 I'm mister God Bless the Mission who rose to expose your tarot 
 And stop the ball club kids on ?stoner? 
 (How about a little fire scarecrow) 
 But brainiac dumb-dumb, bust the duck hunter 
 I let the fuckin' dogs out and they're breeding in big numbers 
 It sorta' irks citizen exes and vexes check collectors 
 Hexed by the flex of a messy pegasus 
 Remarkable but unmarketable 
 Leg'go my treasure chest 
 It's empty, but I use it to cradle my true confessions list 
 Confession one: 
 Aesop was raised to the Colonel Kurtz daycare center 
 For disgruntled youths where it's brilliant to flee the sheep flock 
 You're a little teapot homie please don't feed the pigeons 
 They're tryin' to spread their peacock feathers 
 And bleed through the system 
 This goes out to plainclothes prophets 
 Free for the wisdom 
 Who swore they'd never spend a night and sleep in the pigpen 
 Touch the prickly outer shell of reptilian 
 Minimal nighttime Z-catcher 
 20,000 league mapper, and um 
 Me and my primitive friends drag our knuckles 
 And find your upright bipedal walking ugly 
 (I'll be in the back evolving from a monkey) 
 Thanks to y'all that came to school with paint stains on your fingertips 
 And brought a little life to those Long Island railroad city trips 
 Please, remember I can build you my friend 
 And if I'm not happy, I'll break you the fuck down and build you again 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I drag my alligator belly to the brake light (Hi) 
 And drag my alligator belly back to bed until I die 
 You've got a metal skull with wires through your heart and a dead air surplus 
 (Ludicrous) 
 Like Labor Days bootleggers on some support the movement shit 
 My practice: life inside a pitch black magic pack of rat brackets 
 That's tragic 
 ?Bout to head back? to out for a pack of rat bastards 
 That's an earthworm mentality, flag captured 
 Peaceful: telling me that ?Aes speaks? proudly 
 On a soulful with an idle motor 
 They say decrepit 
 Is where I'm at 
 Sinful like a brain full of bottle rockets 
 Not a model, not a prophet (nope) not ?undone? 
 Got a fuckload of missions here want 'em 
 You can tell your man they came to you in a daydream 
 And I won't rally back, alley cat (Passion) 
 One tall glass (action) 
 Taller glass for the (aspirin) 
 Balderdash (backspin) 
 Back track, back in effect, back in the clutch 
 Sittin' on this old '98 BFA collecting dust 
 Slack-jawed, smiling like a hacksaw, that's raw 
 Spit master conspirator feeder for critics to suck 
 You're off track betting on a one-trick pony 
 With pony express delivery delay effect, funny 
 No, that's not funny 
 City yard slaughtered ugly 
 With pins needles and duck-walks busted 
 Sitting at the movies with a large bucket of Xanax 
 Extra butter and a spring water 
 Kamikaze Zaxxons 
 Flight simulator major 
 Street pilot directly through the iris 
 Fuck it, freak the fader on some fly shit 
  
 [Hook] X2What'd I miss? 
 900 cc's of the raw in one fist 
 The bum's dumb blitz 
 Order in the court where the mortars jump bricks 
 Everybody, lung on the table, this point counterpoint 
 Aesop has the murkiest, yet he numb out the prowler oint (uh) 
 And after bubblegum, he sink into the sofa 
 Clicker to pilot his broadcasted choice of cobra (hissssss) 
 The venom remains the same game of stale toxins 
 Camo'd with the now ornamental satellite options 
 Whatever's good I got this grave half dug (true) 
 But Yani covering taps to make the pain worse than it was (nooo) 
 Playin marbles (playin marbles) 
 Hit by a bus (hit by a bus) 
 Death is sweet (death is sweet) 
 Hell sucks, sucker 
 Damien probably wishin I'd donate a fuck 
 But this shit's chiller than any conversation I've had in months 
 The iron fang drew 'em all loopy (real loopy) 
 So when he extended the hand the planet's Kujo's went Snoopy 
 In perfect synocaption, burnt to crispy critters 
 Like synchronized swimmers in boric rivers 
 Mmmm, poor soaked critters 
 Lick chop dig-in, who dares lick a shot at pigeons? 
 Why I oughta (Vast get em!) 
 He surfs city circuits for the power and the glory 
 To the cowards in the quarry you will always blink before me 
 Its Doc Roc full-effect, campfire stories 
 Like I "Threw Your Momma From the Train" to try to front on "Porkies" 
 He finds the garbage more inspiring than the good stuff (right) 
 His ink sleeps while the military look tough 
 Look, im sorry, crooked priority list 
 But Mr. USA-up-all-night's blackened heart already skips 
 I'm 'bout to crash this bitch to hibernate 
 Tell Wolf Blitzer holler at his boy when he hosts "Blind Date" 
 It goes spit on CNN and force the war back through the cable box 
 Where M1's are like stage props aimed at latest names dropped 
 So now he ignorant, right? (right) 
 No, he just accepts the inevitable apocalyptic syllabus 
 Sing along, Zooka dies of chemical poison, and watch 'em 
 Bring it on 
 Dag nabbit, that cat's faster 
 I dead opinions and swap it out for the urges 
 Of a serpent tryin to stuff it in the jam before the curtains 
  
 He's numb to the guns, thanks to the tank cams 
 Glued to the box like the opposites will shake hands 
 Enough hell for the world's hand baskets 
 Enough cells for the world's hand captured 
 Numb to the guns, now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery 
 Yes dawg, he recognize the history 
 Yes dawg, he recognize the misery 
 But switch for element of surprise and demise 
  
 From m-16's or disco and hula-hoops 
 Murder the fads before the fads murder you and yours 
 Me and mine find T&A on TNT 
 Pleasin' to the iris more than TNT on DNA 
 Morbid but important, I know, stop 
 Mork porked Mindy in this episode, watch 
 POW be buzzin by the rumbling cannons and less amateurs, bystander analyst 
 Went through the "Holy fuckin' shit I'm gonna die" phase 
 Now it's "Well, I'm gonna die, let's get this barn's sides raised" 
 So when they ask what's your opinion on the war? 
 I tell 'em "War sucks donkey dick. What's the Knicks' score?" 
 Maybe it's his allergies, no horns and pitchforks (umm, umm) 
 Dusk muskrat (uhmm) eleven tusk jab (uhmm) 
 Elegant bloodbath, leggin it, egg 'em on 
 Television preg-a-nant and medicine is born 
 Get a mean doubt, community duel glazed over blank white sockets 
 Lookin for a heavy seven richter to shiver the crocs right up out they options 
 Novacaine, bloodwork, spoon though the Lochness 
 Hostage, no shame, suck the fear out his muck 
 So when the nozzles hit his nostrils 
 He don't give a fuck 
 After all, it's just like on TV around the clock 
 The thorns are real and anger management is not 
  
 He's numb to the guns, thanks to the tank cams 
 Glued to the box like the opposites will shake hands 
 Enough hell for the world's hand baskets 
 Enough cells for the world's hand captured 
 Numb to the guns, now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery 
 Yes dawg, he recognize the history 
 Yes dawg, he recognize the misery 
 But switch for element of surprise and demise(What's up this is Aesop Rock for WKCR) 
  
 I traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status to coast muted 
 Finding the night train mildly therapeutic 
 Rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings 
 Beneath this puppet master pulling my strings 
 Leaking smoke rings singing [your despite what measured honestly magnificent] 
 Syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons 
 Nah I don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs 
 Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms 
 We bloomed? the matter down to those most beautifully discrete 
 Applying yesterdays models stand obsolete amongst colossals [amongst colossals] 
 Comply not to enforce us aborted claiming they came off 
 Sort of stabbed them with the capital 'A' that sets my name off 
 Sick of it all 
 Sick of the stalls 
 Sick of the thick brick in the wall sob stories the falls the tragic hate calls 
 Shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl 
 My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls 
 We lining up along against these great walls 
 Circling analytical 
 Rhetorical inquiries yet x is not applicable kid 
 (Your flash minor we as orphans repeated)? 
 You're talkin' concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated kid I'm heated 
 Its flight of the intruder and we all fall down 
 Conditions of never blends science with religion 
 Cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence 
 But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense 
 Well isn't that bewildering 
 Drunken distortion and spit the filter in 
 Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together an you never 
 Seen I Aesop Rock flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine 
 I'm here to ride upon the night train 
  
 [Yeah WKCR 89.9 . . . here for the night train . . . whats up to my man 
 Apex, kinetic, dj ely, baz, my man Dub-L on productions, the mighty ger, my 
 Man Patrick, Blockhead, Mr. Roper, Omega One, my man hates one, Percee P 
 Andre . . . stay up . .. its like that . . . it's big Aesop Rock signing off . .](DJ chatter) 
  
 [Verse I] 
  
 Check it, in a box marked "divinity", I trap the trinity 
 Of honor, evolution, and serenity 
 Pulled the reign into me 
 This archetype hyped oddities of style 
 Lost child prodigy intrigued 
 Fatigued by a suit and tie spy claiming post-Modern peacemakers 
 With the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases 
 Case em when the sun bursts... 
 And the populace awaited my reply: 
 I spit a billion tiny, brilliant white lights into the sky (What) 
 When your last murmurs fade like colors in graff burners 
 Soon to be flustered and clustered in with comrade trash hurlers 
 Color me a sideline observer, alerted not yet retreating 
 And the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing 
 Penny for your reasoning, Doug, which luckily I ain't as blessed to hold your attendance 
 So I could slide my guided tenants on the one 
 That drop in the bucket boogie begun 
 Brick in the wall installments draw a fallen performance 
 Fifth element, critical endurance 
 Kingpin allow only the murkiest swamp bot 
 To slip beneath the skin, this is Aesop 
 Recording til your TDK stops 
 Watch laboratory clone demotions dodge on natural hate crops 
  
 With the bearers of the reptile smile 
 Again and again, blendin' a friend with a fiend 
 Lending' a bended dream 
 Keen, cold, the straight soul drenched, temper 
 Fuckin, back boogie, I'm a settler 
 Kids wanna know the Aesop Rock... 
 The off the top, prototype, straight RoboCop 
 If you're Quasimoto, and you're slo-mo to stop 
 Ya rock bells, I block spells casted 
 If you wanna straight flaccid pass me towards... you 
 What? Kids wanna jet? 'Tis I, the 6 foot 4 space cadet 
 All up in you, kids wanna bend you back 
 So who's the next kid to rock upon the track? 
  
 (other rapper begins, cuts out) 
 (another rapper finishes, DJ) 
  
 Aesop Rock: 
 (Verse from "Wake Up Call") 
  
 (studio chatter) 
  
 Aesop Rock: 
 (Verse from "Shere Kahn") 
  
 (shout-outs all around)[Les Miserables sample] 
 Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade! 
 Troops behind them, fifty men or more! 
  
 [Verse I] 
  
 I target the crux of all that's considered sin 
 The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin 
 Color me what? 
 Spell-bound man hunting hell-hound 
 Special investigations set king pin 
 Bounce and of course your happy 
 Mic activist 
 Axis pivotal point spun all to often 
 Now walk and spin cycle 
 Dug psychadelic syndrome jabs your abdomen 
 I'm adamant with disperse and curse across 
 You're playing your chances broken branches 
 Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it 
 My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning 
 Magnetic field my metal mind driven 
 Threshold fresh coke crush and affect 
 Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate 
 The all absorbing metamorphing monument 
 Not that average once upon a Glock, Glock, Glock 
 Dot, dot, dot, et cetera 
 The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina 
 Burning you back to immobile twitchin fetal position 
 Itching for what could have been if not for who 
  
 This is Aesop Rock 
 I'm with 50 million troops upon my side 
 Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates 
 One hand on my mic 
 While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk 
 My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone 
  
 Close encounters of the first kind 
 Contact cursed minds skies red 
 Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs 
 Overwhelmed and worried, flurried on your sidesteps 
 My pride treads thick 
 Utilize wide lens I slide strength intelligently 
 We utilize mic like skeller 
 Tanky evidently all is not well 
 In a metra pot sell 
 Automatic hell habitat 
 Tainted polutin it's toxic to me 
 The melancholy-Olly-oxygen free on the night watch 
 Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy 
 Radically millions morphing the orphans 
 Spitting distortion 
 Piteous portions lacked a guiding light 
 Overiding and striding through the night 
 Story army extends mics like dendrites 
 I blend life 
 Dark then gray shapes 
 Till displays made illustrate my views on sanity 
 If you're feeling famished we are family 
 Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter 
 I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all 
 Night crawling audio visual veterans 
 Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans 
 50 million poets screaming all on the run 
 That's 50 million hearts beating as one 
  
 This is Aesop Rock 
 I'm with 50 million troops upon my side 
 Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates 
 One hand on my mic 
 While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk 
 My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm goneThis be the dawning of 
 The age of dead water 
 Station every B-boy fragment 
 Somebody live enough to bust through the belly 
 Put a fist up 
 This is a right-now generation murdered by the fanbase 
 This is adored by the writers 
 Dead water 
 With a still-force activated 
 No, I'm not feeling alright 
  
 Formed by the village of badges and bad karma 
 Punched by the stagnant waters 
 Leaked through the fickle whack 
 But by the window sill's three nickles in a piggy bank 
 Honor with a hint of funny stomach from the hunger pains 
 Splashed automatic B-boy with big visions 
 In a matchbox apartment 
 Adjacent a crooked starship 
 Spoon fed a nation in millions, the only remedy: 
 Nine deadly planets with a bullet-riding centerpiece 
 Take me through the gates! 
 I'll find the stink of burning 
 Find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume 
 Con-artist 
 Kamikaze conduct 
 Gone for a second 
 Till divinity whored herself to disaster 
 I recognize the takers 
 By the mechanical stagger 
 As opposed to the skip of 
 Big Brother 
 Badge slasher 
 Theologies who seem to keep the jukies caffeinated 
 Like a Mad Hatter had to sleep now 
 Ask after 
 Calibrate the happy-scale 
 Weigh me soaking wet 
 With a mouth full of dead ideas and see if it tips zero 
 Stripped ego 
 Tall stories of brawl glory 
 I'll be God while you're still living life on a full 40 
 Or maybe I'll be grimacing, homes 
 Poor, broke and lonely 
 Hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity 
 I drink a bad glass of gumption 
 Not bad meaning bad 
 But, bad meaning ... disgustin' 
 Wild child 
 Activator 
 Activate 
 Sludgin' up the dungeon for an accolade 
 And while one documented wild murder 
 Flamed through the city with a wild merger 
 Woke up and a wild-style burner! 
 Space-case 
 Boombox 
 Hate-tapes 
 No lemonade breaks 
 Sweat and no cheddar in Labor Days 
 Right now 
 I'm here to break apart a Bic's piston 
 Plus my "straight and narrows" got more curves than a Russ Meyer vixen 
 Spitting sob stories to confront my thick addictions 
 I'm the dirty basin with the graves of Salem witches 
 Driving my stake through the face of painstakin' business 
 Checkmate 
 Wanna scream misery? 
 Better breath-take 
 Out of sleep 
 Lifted off the botany 
 Little Jackie paper and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery 
 I be the ugliest version of paranoia 
 Kingpin set in motion 
 By the secondhand pressure 
 Some get excited when the Sun folds under 
 Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement 
 Some get excited when the bullets hit bones 
 But I'm board 
 I'll escape through the train yard 
 And sleep till it's broken 
  
 (Same old) 30x 
  
 This be the settling 
 A dead of warm water 
 The mobile B-boy function 
 Somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain 
 Put a fist up 
 This is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial 
 This is the heater to a movement 
 Dead water 
 When a broke vision's got sparks 
 No, I'm not feeling alright 
  
 This be the windshear 
 Dodgin' dead water 
 A solitary b-boy wonder 
 Somebody fresh enough to reinvent the court 
 And put a fist up 
 This is the chalky outline around a classic break-beat 
 This is an agitated moment 
 Dead water 
 With a burnt reason beaten ugly 
 No, I'm not feeling alrightIntro: 
 "Who the fuck is Ace Rock?" 
  
 Verse 1: 
 Automatic whip deck 
 Food for the stiff necks 
 Alpha demeanor crunk but a flunky on the piss test 
 Soundtracker Cip One 
 Hands like vinyl killers that’ll run around 
 And cut them dubplates down to 7-inches 
 And I Jukie Ace 
 Boogie face 
 First do it from the base of the Six Flags 
 Def Jux movement 
 And he Jukie Cip 
 Boogie mixtape hustle 
 Push consecutive classic materials for new Jet Jungles 
 See Bazooka with his arms folded 
 Fists balled up 
 Called up Ox to ride the European tour bus 
 See me in your city where the mics turn blue 
 For the crew don’t let the fuckin’ stage breathe 'til we through 
 Insidious dirt funk litterbug in the New York chronicle form phenom slang 
 Peep the game 
 Keep the fame 
 Leap the chains 
 Or better yet I’ll start this motherfucking revolution 
 Keep the change 
 It goes peace to the Atoms 
 What? Add ‘em up 
 Crypt, Jest, Wind, Vast, Vor, Cip, Alaska 
 Eye at his worm chopper 
 Fingers on the fader 
 And he’s faded if the fingers made the dutch burn proper 
 I let 'em crowd the new record the fuck up for the sensors 
 You don’t know what you forgot, you’ll remember in September 
 It’s gonna make these little style-biting Fraggles lasso they dentures 
 Learning innovation mixed with inherent respect for mentors 
 The antiplane buffing or stuffing throwies down your throat 
 Can ya feel it? That’s rough rugged raw 
 Fuck a sealed kiss 
 Fee fie fo fum smell the dummy tears 
 I’m ghost, Cip take us the fuck up outta here 
  
 Outro: 
 "We stand in the shadow…is our God." (scratched)I pilot a lion heart 
 My polar halves negotiate it (right) 
 Shook upon the difference between tumbleweed and sacred 
 Read a hostel gospel attributed to land shark Apostle squad 
 Unfroze the hideous image like hostile plots 
 Bat up in the belfry (help me) 
 I wanna be the reinvention of fire 
 In a most stagnate tension basket 
 Fenced in a cognitive learning facility built by the makers of stinger repellent 
 But fresh as the active element 
 Bag of bricks roped to a Saturn atlas hooked to madness 
 And I swear my new fresh air till the goblin cried, "fuck the rabbits" and rose 
 Most soloists cannot defend the mighty kingdoms that their passages propose, that's why I am the rose 
 New day, new reign, same old 
 Aches and pains, same old 
 Emaciated frame game, same name 
 Spring water ain't enough anymore 
 I wanna see the river and bottle my own crystal drizzle liquid dinner 
 Well aren't we the phoenix of irritant method 
 Here to steer the flock out the farmland while every shepherd rested 
 With a, head on the wall 
 Of sovereignty's halls 
 I be the head shaker in a sea of nodding novelty dolls 
 Let's, crush the arena 
 Flush the pipe dreamer 
 Touch the skull of each and everything 
 Everything everything 
 I am a scarecrow 
 Bullied by the bullies 
 But the masters had 'em walking in circles like eye patches 
 For the madness 
  
 One day, one ran 
 One cold, one poem 
 One way, one plain 
 One rose, one home 
 One strain, one pain 
 One fold, one zone 
 One element to many to made a hungry man moan 
 I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (it's not cool) 
 I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) 
 I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (na-na nana na-na) 
 No I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) 
  
 Everybody plug into the bludgeon 
 Follow your hunch and align the hunt collection 
 To count their blessings in abundance 
 Once in a crescent moon I'll adapt 
  
 To capture the essence's breakfast's participant's fishin' dissin' adventures 
 Heads gather from every battered aspect of the march 
 To swap gossip 
 Who parted what sea? and 
 Who's hungry? and 
 Who's parched? 
 And it gets tiring wiring the populace an anti grin and list of accomplishments 
 Beyond basic. Residence 
 Stick figures stand at attention, deficit 
 And all's well that blends well with a warm hazardous combine 
 Thick as thieves are they? 
 I bullied the wooly mammoth and champs 
 Germinate frantic decamped to the wino migration, examine 
 Eager to sport motley mosaic illustrate fallen pen-dragon 
 I'm from a room flooded with punishment 
 I've seen drunken sailors pilot they vessels to split the light house 
 Laugh at brown bag liquor list on there way home from the blood bath 
 Half angel with broken halo; half primitive rugrat 
 Spoken for by wild life's hybrid mutations and slum cats 
 Doom for dominion sluggish posture 
 See I wait a lifetime just to pierce these spears through the bellies of every monster 
 10 little warriors sit on a picket fence 
 Ordering themselves for protection of nonsense 
 Catapult the stone that struck the leader in the back and 
 Marked the beauty as the other 9 warriors worlds collapsed

 Notice I said I'd be on my way out the door 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I mean the doors almost closed 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now forget it 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now 
 I'll be leavin now…The bully cycles dig the stitch in 
 Rig the hitch in golden theory 
 Teary victims walk in Slatters like my left eye astigmatism 
 Lift the bridge and sink 
 Link the fink divisions ink transmission with a jinx 
 Instead of tripping off the ways glitter blinks 
 Sinker 
 The book had mentioned several separate crafts that mobilize to clash defendants 
 The end-all installments dissolved in a Class A blemish 'n such 
 I'm touching oxblood skies over my city which hover in blue disguise 
 The dry season New York's five reasons flock to the marketplace 
 Targets chase targets oblivious to if they heart a splash of bull's eye 
 Games begin, blood, dread and sin 
 I'm crawlin soft, all of a sudden somethin' feels a little off 
 I nab a nauseating caution 
 Peddle on exhausted levels 
 Lost in identifying the unsure-edness plus the lord of morbid bliss 
 Tore in the cure that fits 
 I sit, lit up a lung, thoughts spin as I realize "goddamn, its I against I" 
  
 My name is Aesop Rock 
 Bulldozer-brand, exhibit-alpha bad Samaritan 
 I capsize rubber ducks 'n suck the merit in 
 Governed beneath the cherished checks and balances routine 
 I check my balance as routine, check balance in my dreams 
 Stress indeed this greed’ll buckle flunk, and cling to the wrist 
 I thread the needle like my knuckle through the ring 'o my fist 
 Work out the kinks in my wrist 
 Weave up a tapestry so large it covered ev'ry inch of sky 
 So I cut holes for the stars — look up! 
 Hook up the speakers 
 I cook up another heated dirty lung devotion chokin with the ocean's bottom feeders 
 And you love it, 76 inches of sound 
 So ya'll could dig me six feet deep, my eyes'll still be over ground 
  
 Now, I've got myself circlin' over these pushers 
 Each luggin' a bucket of concepts crafted of every shape, element and devious ingredient one could possibly conjure 
 And I consider my trust sacred, and if by chance it leaks in your direction, well 
 I've either known you a long time or I'ma see you tomorrow 
 The daggers that rip that bond are the sharpest 
 But I'll take that pain, cuz in the long run 
 You're prob'ly doin' me a favor 
  
 The Dub-L installation swivels to click Messiah's dirty art 
 Like my lungs upon display'll make the room turn dark 
 A poem review and a compilation of statements made by critically acclaimed modern American composers 
 I digress 
 Wishbone on an Earth hungry for flesh 
 While tyrants hug upon their broadcast treasure guardians 
 Barter frontiers 'til stealth remedies mesh 
 Resident evil 
 We alone hold current cycle to define 
 Graceful ascension over 
 Wasteful intervention 
  
 This little pig hides behind his faithful train collection 
 Bends the tension in trip wires at every landmark 
 And I guess this marks my family [right?] 
 I guess this dark's been charted by those tidal fellow artisans 
 Who assign, comply under the martyrdom 
 Plank walker, the shark infested waters all turn charlatan 
 Alive! 
 Appreciates for rhetorical inquiries 
 I dive 
 I've seen missile line lives fade in tirading heckler academies 
 Divorced from insipidity 
 And honestly 
  
 I discipline the workers in my colony with glorious intention to live 
 Just to walk on my home-made suspension bridge 
 I discipline the workers in my colony with glorious intention to write 
 Just to walk on my home-made yellow brick height 
  
 It's like pillars line these aisles with chrome gates 
 While milestones wait to trip me up 
 Fiddle with thoughts that never led bay trails to victory 
 Just yesterday my main amigo Block described the sinuses (??) 
 (????)To pull the (halves/haps which) bleed a scene on opposite assignments 
 We offsprings plucked off the worry willow one 
 (???)Campbell cat anonymous 
 Strokin' tokens of broken promises for hobby 
 I scrape the pennies out my back pocket for needy drunks 
 Like low riders scrape their bellies on speed bumps 
  
 Purity's the lure and I'm on top 
 (????)Middle siblets gripping aka Aesop Rock 
 I saw the sunlight riding in harmed 
 And hell, it died right in my arms 
 Now I'm breathin' in the evenin', the evenin'... 
  
  
 "Please help with correction of this song, it's not finished yet!"It goes welcome the pop off, some pop soft. We bang b-bang b-bang bang out loud. Ready on the left with a face full of death. We slanged out fang mouth bang out now 
  
 This is a never dug disco, Zoo York tycoon, memorandum bonanza banter clamp crunk out the fish bowl. Gorgeous how struggling gills wriggle out water, ain't it? Same scape as the walls crawling with paranoia's plaintiffs. The robo-komodo promo Zen patience a-alike to this jittery drooling mess. Bitterly unruly on mud hugger alert, he usher dirt to the kick circus. Deflected labor ethic questions peeled at the field workers. Is it raw? Please... does a priest need a ten-foot pole to baptize little Linus minus the lap ride and tease? Evolution is a leader depleter, seeker needy sheep idol feeder beware, once complete you might not want to be there. Dead straw to gold bar spin fiber. Lost and fond in a smitten kitten's incisors. They Aphrodite all over the burgle of a purple heart compartment. Marched a burgundy carpet alarmed and far to parched to bark it. Lil' Abner. A real firecracker. Grows to throw 'bows with vehicular hijackers. To eavesdrop plots cops hired a wire tapper. That's a whipper snapper trapped beneath my grip on the fire ladder. Took drums over to deril' to once over the line tones. Punch toothy ticks 'til they find homes like three ruby clicks. The roof is on fire where snoopy sits right now. You should have shot yourself in the foot when it was in your mouth 
  
 CHORUS 
 Thieves in the strobe deep freeze your pose. For the disease that grows underneath your toes holds up a reason y'alls gold never seems to glow. Now we can all breath slow once the fiend's exposed. It goes heave ho. You never got the grit right. Bark fame but you never put the grit down. Hawk styles but you never got the grit right. Put the grit down. Grit right. Get down 
  
 This is a never dug disco defamation of dog and pony grappled out chincey, chipping Leo Da Vinci phonies pushing kill of hill bloated. Nobody got you. While biggest brother's watching bigger brother watching big brother watch you. Nothing says circus fun quite like nuclear holocaust over breakfast on the terrace. Hash browns and peril. Old ironsides or good ship lolli-popper, Davy Jones still got a locker, ak, the opera's more than docs and soccer moms. Now before you kick your feet up, I married and divorced mother nature after sweet-talking that old hag out of a pre-nup. This information's neither braggadocio nor secret, just know as of now the world is technically not yours, peanut. It's a day in the life of the carnie dog-faced boy escapist. Living large, watching Springer, smoking beedies wrapped in bacon. At night his get busy disease leakage peaketh. Merk the he say/she say, BK Jesus turn peg legs to Adidas on the down stroke. And they like 'what's up with the name?' I tell'em y'all made Bazooka Tooth I's about to ask the same. But before you curfew the city and shut down every block, I'd like to say I still Aesop the fuck out of the Rock 
  
 CHORUS 
  
 This is a never dug disco. Spread feelers. Tonka zonk Gepetto bred beezers. Jeepers, gee wilikers, goshes galoshes, Christ, god almighty. They tore his limbs off kilter, still the hostage moshes slightly. Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche. He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly. He woke, corroded buggy facial, insect chopper biting. He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted. He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking. He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him. He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty. He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely. I alert vital spider works to cultivate grit, ship the bulk rate shit. Herbie the love bug drugs pulsate whips. Tie in spite for commoner idiocy and good old-fashioned biblical plague. We move units off your pagan escapade. And it's pits to the peg legged. Megas eclipse cripples so that pimp limp's wheel chair basketball when 15 minutes fizzles. Your flimsy frame marks hip-hop's second most tragic event and will 'til Jam Master Jay's resurrection and second death 
  
 CHORUS[Instrumental: Sample] 
 Fuck you[Instrumental]Same hand that snuggled the barbed wire 
 Tug an orphan assortment of bell and three-alarm fire 
 Beautiful loser maneuver the goofy cubicle future alert 
 Big brother super-community burn 
 OK shoppers, tickets won't last 
 For the straight-to-video "Dog-Boy eats glass" 
 To be a mess match rotate a role a Babylon (?) 
 Darwin on a peg taking his innervate to tag along 
 Ape escape gravitron, surly with two caps 
 One over the mask with …(?) 
 And it was home depot for the five finger lazy lift 
 Ironically the same five measure the spray radius 
 Spray gradient, baiting for city tetris 
 Double-breasted hecklers barking picket fences 
 Now mobile roads develop a special network 
 Which further upsets the rich to rubberneckers double-check us 
 Tonight the scum dance and I got all my money on the one with the lung cramps 
 Little rat in the maze, they score another's (?) escape 
 Sorta likes the attention so he says check-in and stays 
 Answer: how do we record a documentary and suffering while ushering the public hands in 
 Or transfer greedy bruisers to user-friendly stanzas? 
 I guess it's like a junkwad full of dondy's candice 
 Product, now, a tampered-with, contaminated shrink-wrapped variant of the process, wow 
 It's written by a messenger pigeon to hell's kitchen 
 Thank you for the dollar, hope you dig it 
  
 Clap once for the junkyard punks 
 Good, clap twice for the junkyard knights 
 Good, pay attention 'cause part three of the lesson 
 Can fiddle with your direction, clap at every sentence 
 Heroes are never forgotten, legends never die 
 This is what I sound like alive 
  
 Two milligrams later, hits the stage 
 With Big Wiz on the fader, gravy aviators tipped low on the nose 
 And we ogle over the frame with a pine-box channel pioneer eye aim 
 We azaki makeover the bk sky 
 So when the jungle hits the city every insect is alive 
 Poison for the town square and by the stinger needle 
 And if I sound scared, it's 'cause I pay rent with the little people 
 Dumb it down for none but none dumber 
 The dumb-out posse is off broadway for the summer, bummer 
 And stiller's in her loch ness clock fresh and official the missiles 
 Rock bells, no bells or whistles 
 Shell-shocked with a flock of hell's wolves or minstrels 
 Shell-toed ghosts or nostalgia signals 
 Grassroots schools always kept it simple 
 Pour the water in the dirt then observe the impulse 
 Dixie cup telephoner animate part door and port wars …(?) 
 Swarms formula: please hit snooze, keep a civil tongue in your teeth 
 You will need it to lick wounds 
 And he wrote his own laws, claws and cougars 
 On a fire in the sky sorta steers the stupider luke drums, dummy 
 Never off-base, with a resume of b-boyisms and pause tapesHe's a Maniac. Maniac 
 All in all in all in all in all 
 (laughs) 
 All in all ... 
  
 All star navigate blood-bath circuit...circuit 
 All city wolf pack'll arm all servants...service 
 All and all cut from similar scissors and surgeons...circus 
 All machines murder if the herders merked nervous...nervous 
 In around em all in all out pedigree centipede maladjusted curb purge all binge 
 All out a machine with cog misalignment - shooting star 
  
 Eight-ball all alien appendage out his cookie jar 
  
  
 These are not his office hours 
 What he coughs is mandatory 
 Three obnoxious hawks and howlers 
 Roughly buff the categories 
 Twenty broad shoulders, all sober, all circuit-prowler 
 And matador electric tongue stung at sergeant markers sour 
 Who the fuck, needle Jux property 
 Chickens've all been 
 Soaked under the water works, all other birds evolve with me 
 Duck and a phoenix and rout behemoth architecture out the jungle 
 Where my condors can reorganize their numbers 
  
 All day pool party in  journalism Zion 
 And bazooka flash the grin she decorate the closest Nikon 
 Bazooka flash the molars decorate the close Minoltas 
 Canon Hasselblad quicker than Polaroid exposures 
  
  
 If open voltage leads all funny play tip the fuddy duddy fuck long come on 
 Get your stolen drums on 
 All of y'alls all dumb out pimping art like a whore's bach 
 And all of y'alls all couldn't rap your way out of a card-board box 
 Get high now, solidify your zone 
 And let the medallion of spiritual accomplishments keep growing 
  
  
 Oh snagglepussy getting pushy mushing dirt up in the gears like 
 Aesop Rock is all ears 
  
  
 All in together now 
 Dear lord holler at me 
 All i know is hell is down and god don't cover doctoral fees 
 No phases all over civility like greased-up baby groins 
 But I will not stand for the flipping of a weighted coin 
  
  
 Suck we are the new now colony all mangy-like 
 Radar for the crazy oink 
 Keep winning for later joint 
  
 All for one and one for all and justice for all and fiddlin' with dead mice 
 Only toughens the claws, my all systems go will be perceiving dystopian civil war 
 Steal a meal to the last tickle in your jaw 
 All clammy all-state labor day committee folk 
 Got busy worker ants intimidate the sitting duck 
  
 And that my good people is my piece 
 All in one manual 
 There's only one in all the shaking hands you do 
  
 I'll trade the pound for pennies opus, I don't need it 
 Fuck now look y'all heed itWe don't need no walkie-talkies, nope, no walkie-talkies 
 We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no 
 We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope, no walkie-talkies 
 We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go 
  
 And the last shall be 
 First to immerse in the pass out heat 
 Face in the mud where the moxie melt 
 'Till he woke up drowning in chachkes hell 
 More in a cave with a torch on the wall 
 Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls 
 On a brand new day, saw what he saw 
 Property owners who crawl to the mall 
 With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law 
 Pace like he mourning a loss 
 Right hand on a can of worms 
 Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean 
 Thats O.K., you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day 
 But a model of mercy and might? no way 
 Marionette who will clap and obey 
 Dude, look, all that noise? 
 Call that flight of the water boys 
 Meet and greet and they all slap five 
 Cheek to cheek when they colonize 
 And a grown ass man shall abide as he wish 
 Walk that path with a dime and a stick 
 Walk that path with a diamond and wine 
 Walk that path to the firing line 
 Just walk, pay no mind 
 To the new recruit with the play-doh spine 
 Let's be friends from opposite ends 
 Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence 
 Play to the radius far and away 
 Orbit wide don't park in his space 
 One little martyr who talk in his face 
 Make one little weathermen sharpen the blades 
  
 We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope, no walkie-talkies 
 We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no 
 We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope, no walkie-talkies 
 We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go 
  
 And the last shall be 
 First to the curb with the mad cow meat 
 Face in the bars of a regular cell 
 When he woke up high in collectible hell 
 Boom town kid who was taught by the binge 
 That a man who expire with the most shit win 
 That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich 
 Not a routine friend in a pinch 
 Still not used to the stench 
 How it throws off otherwise lucid events 
 In the case the afraid observe 
 I got a pro-keds box full of layman's terms, it goes 
 Hey, peace, pray for the plagued 
 Major relief and capacious rains 
 But just cuz I don't want to war with you 
 It don't mean go warm up the barbecue 
 I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit 
 My high noon is a quick little minute 
 I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic 
 Who simply isn't going to ever really get it 
 This HQ is alive and alone 
 No driveway no sign of a home 
 No dial tone, no line for the phone 
 No world's tiniest violin song 
 And i might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue 
 With a deep breath hiding and bored 
 Fighting a smile, highly annoyed 
 When the timing is right I will rise and record 
 Call for the monster beats and blockhead got 
 Animal drums like he's doctor teeth 
 It goes red light green light 1 2 3 
 One large coffee, fuck you, peace

 John Darnielle: 
 I crawled down to the basement 
 When the weather got cold 
 Like a lost lamb returning to the fold 
 And when the outside world recedes from view 
 It's just a year's supply of make-up 
 And memories of you 
 1967 colt 45, holding back the vampires 
 Keeping me alive 
 There's an envelope with some cash in it 
 Out by the front door 
 This is what they make you take the medication for1 of 4... 
  
 My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz 
 I was born in one-nine-seven-six, at Syosset hospital 
 Located in Long Island, NY 
 I am six foot, four. I weigh two-zero-zero pounds 
 I have brown hair, and green eyes 
 I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies, and diner food 
 I have two brothers, Chris and Graham 
 And two parents, Paul and Damita 
 In August of two-zero-zero-one, I went crazy... 
  
 This was originally not for public consumption 
 This was made for four people... 
 Four people that literally saved my life 
 They know who they are... 
 And uh, I mean I could live to be a thousand years old and never repay them 
 I don't think this song would pay for them 
 But hopefully by putting it out 
 It'll push the thank you a little further... 
  
 This ain't a burner for the whips. (No, it isn't) 
 This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor. (No, it isn't) 
 My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz, and I was born in Long Island, New York, seventy-six 
 Before Graham and after Chris... OK 
  
 In August of two thousand one, my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone-scaffolding imploded 
 I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling 
 To the cold hard concrete on mere bodega trips 
 For cigarettes and soda, shook me to Casper 
 Dizzy with an argent chaser, motor sensory eraser 
 Agoraphobe tunnel-vision, guilt, self-loathing arrangement 
 Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in 
 That abates three separate foreign meds 
 While I was used to hook-line-and-sinker-simple fission 
 Simple, primitive, self-taught easing of soul, mind and body 
 But the symptoms rejected my caveman Modus Operandi 
 So now it's one fish, belly up, through medicated mileage 
 And shrinks that get $250 an hour for awkward silence 
 And, I'd be lying if I said all of this 
 Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me 
 That's real... Simply put 
 I don't know what happened, or what's still happening 
 I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity 
  
 JAMIE, I killed the robots and I'm sorry 
 Broke down in front of you. Embarrassed 
 But you lent a heart and hand that only you could 
 You're one of my best friends and, yes, I'd take that bullet for you 
 That's my word, which is about all I have left 
  
 TONY, I know you know I'm crazy, 'cause you told me 
 But that didn't ever bother you 
 I hold you as my brother 'til death 
 And I got your back if ever the drunk goblins step 
 For makin' a cat laugh, when I was walking with the dead 
  
 KATHERINE, mother figure, older sister. Concerned beyond limits 
 Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this 
 Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits 
 Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons 
  
 RIYAH, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed 
 An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it 
 You'd listen to me blab about my issues for hours 
 Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished 
  
 Am I a jack of all trades? Nope... I like to write songs, though 
 Are they good? I dunno... 
 But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it 
 So take this how you want, but know I mean it 
 I want you all to know that I'm scared out my fuckin' crooked soul 
 Never faced a monster like the last few months ever in my whole life... 
 I wish I could explain this better, (I can't) 
 But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive 
 So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you; 
 Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness 
 I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement 
 'Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it 
  
 Thank you 
  
 I wish I could explain this better 
  
 Thank you 
  
 I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures 
  
 Thank you 
  
 I love you all with all that's left of me. (Thank you) 
 For helping try to kill what made a mess of me. (Thank you) 
 Somehow, someway, (Thank you) 
 I'mma get you back someday. (Thank you) 
 Just gotta figure this all out... So... 
  
 I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back 
 How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures 
 Other men operate normally under 
 I have scoped this out from all angles, multiple times 
 I have been over everything in my head, 'til I can't think anymore 
 But I guess sometimes, when you can't breathe, there are people there 
 To breathe for you 
 I am lucky enough to have those people around me 
 Thank you for helping me to not die 
  
 Thank you for helping me to not die 
  
 Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt 
 Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt[Instrumental]Some cats grow by the laws of the wild 
 Some learn slower and lag in the mud 
 Some stand up in defense of a style 
 Some let the big dogs eat them up 
 At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound 
 At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st some shit went down 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin 
 Five Borough fame guaranteed to itch pigskin 
 Raided near the Brooklyn Naval Yards, juxed an undercover 
 When they asked him what he pled he said, "You're fuckin' up my cover!" 
  
 [Mr. Lif] 
 Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse 
 Said he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out 
 Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine 
 Another dead immigrant, that's the American Dream 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig 
 Overqualified with the rent stick 
 Red brick bash with a texted green screen 
 Like, "I entered my data right into your screen" 
  
 [Mr. Lif] 
 Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman 
 Sick of pushing skewed information 
 And abusing the nation 
 Had a few options: 
 Either jump or run 
 Critical ways or waving a gun 
 Time for C-H-A-N-G-E 
 Held a knife to the VP on TV 
 She demanded that the format be expanded 
 Beyond fear, everybody clear, understand it? 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Billy was a coke fiend 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 Maggie was a cop 
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Like a dope he stole green 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 She patroled the block 
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Banking off his old scheme 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 She recognized his plot 
 [Aesop Rock] 
 He thought he was home free 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 She knew that he was locked 
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 She pocketed the crack before they got far 
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Billy watches Maggy from behind steel bars 
 Like "Where the crack went" 
 [Mr. Lif] 
 "I'ma smoke it tomorrah" 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 They call him Larry Luck 
 Blackjack, big spender 
 He was married once 
 Till he bet her ring finger 
 Seen him leaving Las Vegas 
 With a pick up truck, diamond 
 Forty large, and beautiful wife piece 
 Less than what he came with 
 Itched to get rich found nickels in the couch 
 Hitched back to the casino with in an hour 
 Said "I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents" 
 And was immediately shot to his death over debts 
  
 [Mr. Lif] 
 As Colin died, his mother cried 
 Then the EMS survived 
 Said that he could be revived but they lied 
 Afterlife realized that water from the skies 
 Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 Now, J.J. punch drunk, acts like a dumb fuck 
 Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck 
 One saw the light, thought it right to rat him out 
 Now gets raped by Aryans in the big house (OUCH!) 
  
 [Mr. Lif] 
 Ted did 20 years for rolling some weed 
 Though he used to snort coke and dabble with speed 
 Welcome home, homie, here's a blunt with hash 
 You know the rules, bitch, take two and pass 
  
 Some cats grow by the laws of the wild 
 Some learn slower and lag in the mud 
 Some stand up in defense of a style 
 Some let the big dogs eat them up 
 At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound 
 At exactly 11:35pm on Januray 21st some shit went down 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 I got one Jack or Jill 
 Jill won't, Jack will 
 Jill didn't, then did it 
 Jack fell 
 No cellophane secrets, b 
 I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar 
 No cell 
 But hell, you jump the bar so well 
 Parted your partners veil and dipped 
 I'm New York harbor 
 Tale of a sail, ripped sorta 
 Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace 
 But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday 
 Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway 
 He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wild 
 Same one she used to hold in both smiles 
 ? instinctual last shout if it killed me 
 So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free 
 One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back 
 Sippin the fits you skipped when shit cracks 
 They never missed it 
 Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the same 
 Shoebox with the flicks and lipstick 
 I'll love you forever, cuz you know me better 
 For the record, that one time I would've married you in a second 
 But kill the rekindling dreams and navigate the friendship 
 Or else by the time the stress wears out we'll both be dead and friendless[Instrumental](Sample from System 605) 
 "You can come, and meet my mother 
 Any day you like 
 System 605, Union 91" 
  
 (Aesop) 
 I forever wallow in glitches grimly distributed by side effects 
 Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches drenched! 
 Gridled between dense pillars of polar value lies 
 A grey so blueless it's got eye fiendin for the sky 
 Synthesized lies rise synthetic 
 Sittin inside solidified plastics who's latteral burns germ compatible 
 My firm's radically piloted, dodging a fire swiftly 
 Yellow brick stalker walking shifty 
 I am but a prototype metroid programmed to holocaust style 
 While you're soakin in the stages of denial 
 Your petty soldiers seem fragile like Giacometti sculptures 
 Embedded in aramatic cultures. We's rock steady vultures 
 Plus I's the guise of rowin a soul 
 My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles 
 Bezerk 
 Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it 
 Stripping, color my passion mitigated 
 Slipping 
  
 (Ann Colville) 
 You always seem like a small grey cat to me 
 Sleepin underneath the silvery moon 
 Paws curled beneath your head 
 'til the sun came round just around noon 
 And you would greet me, purring in your doorway 
 Drawing up your tail around my hips 
 And I would go to your mouth wide open 
 Waitin for my nourish to come from your lips 
 And I move you 
 And you like it 
 Just enough 
 To let me 
 But I hate you 
 Cause you're lonely 
 And you know how 
 To forget me 
  
 (Aesop) 
 For the love of my personal practice I reside 
 Where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawl collides 
 Slide fuel by the fury 
 Spun a ring around my honor 
 But the opulence took shelter in my horror 
 Melancholy masquerade 
 Cast amongst the braiding of biligerence 
 And blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement 
 I stay special agent till the sky falls 
 Reverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse 
  
 (Ann Colville) 
 And your footsteps leading down the pathway 
 Never seem to be quite like my own 
 Your mind is smokey circles 
 It blinded me till I turned towards home 
 And you would watch me far in the distance 
 Hands held high above your head 
 I only leave the territory where there's nothing left, to be said 
 And I move you 
 And you like it 
 Just enough 
 To let me 
 But I hate you 
 Cause you're lonely 
 And you know how 
 To forget me 
  
 (Sample from System 605) 
 "You can come, and meet my Mother" 
  
 (Aesop) 
 I make music and connect color to canvas 
 Swoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits 
 Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace 
 Saw my planted leaf stars burnin from the oustide in 
 Meaning your clout lies thin 
 Salt prep the blades prior to five phase in my ever changin underworld 
 Serate a day to decorate a traitor 
 That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades 
 Follow my portion, Im gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter 
  
 (Sample from System 605) 
 "You can come, I'll leap right over 
 Any day you like 
 System 605, Union 91"[Hook: Aesop Rock] 
 You don't wanna be some old dude 
 Shaking a fist at the new bold youth 
 You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude 
 You don't wanna be some old dude 
 Wagging a finger at the new bold youth 
 You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude 
  
 [Verse 1: Aesop Rock] 
 And I know you know I'm sucker proof 
 Mediate the over under, leaning over onion soup 
 And soda... Armchairs, Underoos 
 Camera's on the entrances, TV's on The Bugaloos 
 Speaking of, what's up with you's? Y'all tried chilling? 
 No, whole time bow tie spinning, like "Hzzzzzz..." 
 Cough cough sputter, not to worry, there will always be another 
 I wanna say I nurtured all you little green settlings 
 But these lapses get the guillotine snapping, it's distracting 
 All-righty, play me what bumps 
 Yuck, I'm getting too old for this, shucks 
 Aes stay gold for this much 
 Gray and mostly tits up 
 Old man winter, eyes on the prize 
 Give the lowest of lives, the highest of fives 
 'Cause... 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 2: Rob Sonic] 
 Wassup breezy, it's the brush fire 
 Put Vicks on my chest like I'm Russ Meyer 
 I love Breyers, but I'm dumb tired 
 When they say "based," I say "safe" like an umpire 
 They say waders are lame with the brush binder 
 Daryl Hall hair is bald as a bus tire 
 Janitorial and we're sore when his funk fibres 
 Start moving pip-squeaks like I'm Keith on a drum riser 
 Up in the club krumpin' - what up shorty? 
 "Yo, what are you, like 40?" 
 That's a whole other story with rips in the root page 
 And if age is just a number it's bugging it's room mates 
 Like dudes, keep it down you're driving me Bruce Wayne 
 And I'm three floors down and still hearing your 2Chainz 
 Oh that's One Direction well regardless dude 
 It's not Nas getting live at the barbecue 
 So tomorrow dude just keep the drama calm 
 Because it's not funny when you call me Big Papa John 
  
 [Hook] 
  
 [Verse 3: Busdriver] 
 I am not here at the Raise A Roof or Parallax for feral cats 
 I'm in the same age group as Darryl Mac 
 Ask these slender teens if the denture cream is in stock 
 Engendered of remembered dreams in my inbox 
 Of [???] denim jeans or Gwendoline's like, "Pick rocks" 
 Now my bum knee and limbs pop like rimshots 
 And twenty-something's hard to compromise movie tropes 
 While my aftershave is some homogenized Uzi smoke 
 So how can I optimize the booty stroke 
 While my sole possesion is a fossilized dookey rope 
 I mean I got etchings in my worry lines 
 But how the dream rings off the the precipice of thirty-nine 
 It's depressing, some pre-dating toe tags 
 Spell checking in a suicide note drafts 
 Y'all pull vintage tees out of them tote bags 
 I got a vintage me that is visibly cro-magHola...! 
 Let's go ya'll 
  
 One for the money 
 What up? 
 What's good in the galley? 
 This one for the ghosts 
 Sniffin glue in the alley 
 I bounce with a set a sims 
 Equipped with a foul jowl moment 
 Waitin for that great celebrity towel throw-in 
 (Now) Aes trane invasive species how to bleed stones 
 Cold Ol' Yeller 
 Rogue shelter melter 
 Drag a leech pelt caper to rubble he call home 
 Then leap out of Gattaca to cuddle and brawl bowed 
 Or should he crawl wrong to brawny ogres of Weatherville? 
 Little Billy Spillaguti 
 Hopped up on that debt of bills 
 One man walkin' through a world of mother fuckers 
 Like one Ben Hawkins in a world of Brother Justins 
 Bust the Hellcat on a Hot 
 Tin, or rock a sars mask 
 And limp their red carpet 
 To cough in a pop star's hands 
 When the troublesome bubblegum muse occasion ekes itself 
 The meek, in admirably, evacuate his arm span 
 Tarzan of Long Island savaged to feed the fam (Fam) 
 Who stuff candles alongside scavengers of the damned (Damned) 
 Stubble waste and insects 
 Orphaned to crooked portions 
 When looked at it 
 In comparison to the fortunes and boredom 
 Who pussy for the dollar? 
 Fuck it 
 Whore 'em 
 And I label that 
 Now my sheep is a shepherd's table scrap 
 Play with that 
 Sailors knot 
 Wine for his limbs 
 Plus a cane and hat 
 Shake it for the same critics 
 Who later will fillet the fact 
 Yeah, my up-jump's the boogie 
 You'll jump start the noogie-wagon 
 Loogie 
 Up jumps the jukie (Jukie) 
 Cold (cold) 
 Get retarded 
 And bother you 
 Till you buy my shit 
 Like Smiley to Mookie 
 Aesop-rickety-Rock 
 He up and walked off 
 Showed 'em how the zeitgeists walk dogs 
 Showed 'em how to 
 Dodge boss hogs when the markers are gripped 
 Screamin, "Damn!  I'm gettin to old for this shit!" 
 Sip one 
 We kill 'em with cuts and no alibi 
 Fly shit 
 Raised in the heart of NY shit 
 This is not your over-the-counter rap 
 More like over the counter 
 Into the Klonopin and back 
 Overhaul that! 
 Keep shit crispy! 
 Keep using your fifteen minutes to diss me 
 I love it 
 Thanks 
 One sec' left 
 Have a nice life 
 Good night 
 God blessHall of Game - Aesop 
 [Intro] 
 My style sits on the brink 
 My life's slived in a blink 
 My mics spun ’til the greeks redefined dizzy 
 My city tends to sleep when you walk and 
 It walks when you ain't with me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I write in Blue so I never fuck up 
 King felon, dumbstruck 
 Notice the mandible unhinging as preparatory measure in back burner binge festival 
 Gobbled up the rook and ran off with the queen pin spectacle 
 Here’s to the hellbound czars and sharks 
 The post modernized western burn civilization 
 We infinite like NY kitchen cockroach infestation 
 Avalanched over your safety dance coma 
 Stare-adactyl 
 I lay the boogie deep beneath the porch 
 Sleep it off and dreams bubbled via German Fat Caps 
 Snuck off beneath angel feather camo 
 Some believe we're sheep deteriorating 
 Frozen picket fence frames 
 Chest flames, the hazy weight's connected to the chest pain, but 
 I set a time for two ages to meet the owned and 
 Try the crop land remanence 
 Then jam film in the polaroid 
 I'm like last live specimen 
 Or rather last specimen to live life with my cats eye on the pendulum 
 Your cities broke pigpen pedigrees plow pretentiously towards the pigeonholing of a life time 
 So note the endless dignity sabbatical 
 Cause mine live in a big bass barrel 
 Drunk hates the bantam waiters (BUST) 
 One tribe trapped before the season ended (ended) 
 Lore to Earthworms, the string game 
 Paddle upstream like Bronx bound 6 trains 
 Tryna fill the void, lacking the link in the bliss chain(pissed game) 
 See which Polly Pocket prodigy doctors yacht on the war pig harbors 
 Unaware the blue bearded run these waters (I know) 
 I trap clowns leisurely for livin', period 
 Screaming like they didn't hear me yet 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Man I rock New York City all years around 
 And my name is known, all over the town y'all 
 The people here love the way I run my game 
 They can't wait, to see me make the Hall of Fame (2x) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Yo its like that cape's pretty 
 But the float takes merit 
 Like vagabonds cherish cardboard and friendship 
 I caught a bland image showcasing the how to leap a freight car 
 To wait with my chin sitting space bar (know he didn't) 
 Shovel coal for the slick pistons benedictions (nah don't mention it) 
 Just bless this pendulum's beetle bailey left right development 
 Tutor recruiter slap happily oblivious 
 To Nazi, born again, pagan, agnostic rally 
 It outside my apartment, by the market 
 It's in the park, its growing child classic 
 With an instant indifference to class offenses 
 He smashed that Perry lunge amalgum pensive 
 Cuz yesterday I wished upon my eyelash for a stick figure to fence with 
 I’m salvaged from the chaos of the student tomb 
 Just scrape the barnacles off my exposure 
 Graff's badgered latterday pioneer(first post) 
 First post Big Bang mobile object scoping any social prospects 
 A smidgen reluctant to fuck with 
 Tryna gallop with feet stuck in molasses’s learning curve 
 (Yeah but the grass is burning) 
 Classy, the way the horns curl backwards 
 Excusing soldiers from the table, no care package (care package) 
 Now when the rabid walk 
 The slackers get amped the hasten the pacin 
 Knowing screams are turning cult classics 
 I’m moving swift but safely through the orange code medley 
 But discrete. Tryna make my legacy look fresh 
 Even From the balcony seats 
  
 [Chorus 4x] 
  
 It goes peace to the Overground 
 Peace to the Orphanage 
 Peace to  the to Stronghold 
 Peace to the Hardcore’s finest 
 Peace to the Adam’s fam 
 Peace to the Def Jux 
 Peace to the Rhymesayers 
 Peace to the Waitlist 
 Peace to the Brainchild 
 Peace to the Golden monkey 
 Peace to the Live spot 
 Peace to the Head bob 
 Peace the to Sight Beyond 
 Peace to the Wax Poetic 
 Peace to Aes Rock, there I said it and I meant it’(No) X6 
 (Say What!) X6 
  
 All that glitters is gold with no frills 
 Post no bills, and the rigmarole is so ill 
 And roadkill bake over BK blacktop 
 Summer of tough lovin' for that decayed mascot 
  
 To settle in a worm lunch lovely and vile 
 Half never even got comfy in a style 
 Fifteen pas(-senger) van ran around the country 
 Lugging the heavy duffels of the hungry and proud 
  
 Young, dumb, loud, and reppin' the locale 
 Of whatever foul four-track nurtured the child 
 And it works for a while when a stone cold serf 
 Get a megaphone and perch in a crowd--wow 
  
 First things first, to alert the aloud 
 Free every worker immersed in denial 
 Circle the now 'til its face turned purple 
 And never ever once turn worship and bow 
  
 Walk that fence 
 Like a deer in headlights through a fish-eyed lens 
 Hopped out the Ford for more folklore 
 'Til his cape got caught in the door one morn' 
  
 Please don't tap the phone and go 
 No lights on but the cat is home 
 Catacomb kid cuddy with his calicos 
 Try to coax thick money out the rabbit hole 
  
 And it's a diary of savage folk with no future 
 (No) no teacher taught him how to maneuver 
 (No) no rules so we off of the blueprint 
 With no regrets, and blame self for the bloopers 
  
 Cooped up, keeping the quills dipped and busy 
 With a little killer pill and no tolerance for the tipsy 
 Whether it stinks a city, I'm opening up 
 You sick of running on empty, come and soak in the smut 
  
 (Say what) (6x) 
  
 Hey, you, ready on the left 
 I was high with the winged, I was deep with the dead 
 I was dragging a dagger through the dim city dregs 
 With a blacksmith cough and a box of cassettes 
  
 Hey, you, ready on the right 
 I was air with the missiles, I was irked with the mights 
 I was hopped up heading for the last of the lights 
 With a sweaty upper lip on a midsummer's night 
  
 No (6x) 
  
 (Say what) (6x) 
 (Come on)[Sample] 
 Seven years old and he's dying of old age! 
 And I don't give a fuck about any of you limp bizkit funny boys! 
  
 [Intro] 
 I was on some all in together 
 Whether whore, whether beggar 
 Whether rat or weathered leper 
 Come and cut this edge a second 
 We could build a better network 
 Without all the yes sir, yes sir 
  
 [Verse] 
 Post cannons up 
 Pull the pulse up outcha mans and what 
 Dick and Jane escape into the arcane where the phantoms fuck 
 Itchy skin he sits inside shifty village snitching 
 Grin and gargle when they argue happy 
 Are you happy? Sit and spin (sink or swim) 
 He kick his fins and wave his bony arms around 
 For guards who beg your pardon 
 While the arson burns your harvest down 
 What a darling town 
 What a snarling partridge farm 
 The bars are like a car with clowns 
 The parks are like a garbage barge 
 But still it was our parthenon 
 We part to train tomorrows argonauts and archers 
 With lungs that match their markers 
 Like army parkas marching 
 Through the marsh with buzzing sparklers 
 To carve apart the harpies 
 And disarm the budding marksmen 
 Are you charged up? 
 This be the trench foot kicking 
 Through the ten cook kitchen 
 Spoiled beef and chicken 
 We gobbled up the chemical in heaps, in new relief 
 Was thirty minutes past 
 The chalky tablets melting in our teeth 
 A dagger in the back became a fad to swagger jack 
 With no medicinal maggots to lap the gashes aftermath 
 These are the crazers of the Benadryl nation 
 That'll steal the very bacon 
 Off your plate, thats so raven 
 Been jittery killer-the artillery parties 
 Lit up like symphony of pretty Ataris 
 Fitting the knitting needle splintered through the kewpie 
 Duke(?) 
 I speak in a dead language New York is hollerin' through me 
 Note the lazy foe be seven clicks outside the poppy fields 
 Telescopes and coffee spills 
 Folding chairs and orange peels 
 Peanut shells and all is fair 
 In loving brawlers crawling through the august air 
 That's the muggy handicap we all must share 
 And morning smells like blood worms 
 In the beaks of the very falcon 
 But how can arrested splendors 
 Of wretched sleep walk the palate 
 Palpating hearts like woe to you rascal eddy hazels 
 Which one of you bitches would flip the table? 
  
 [Outro] 
 Its gonna be a long night! 
 A real long night(Verse 1) 
 Whistles, bells, ten by ten cells 
 The peasants in the seven ten split that never fell 
 Who print a third rail tiger twine débutante situation 
 And pencil me in [?rad-doom?] we'll see if we can't make you famous 
 The operetta sunk by sunken skulls fed the chubby tenor jealousy [?Dolby Digi capture?] format 
 Dawned with that angelic shimmer similar to my brothers first four-track 
 Cocooned [?a cool?] high school inconsistent success callbacks 
 "I don't want to hear you whinin' 'bout you coulda shoulda woulda been a pilot" 
 Well that's a beautiful regret, that I couldn't quite hear 
 I was busy flying by it in my SR-71 Blackbird soul-craft 
 With license dangling for middle digit wiln' "How are you?" 
 Feeling restless, incredible sense of full galaxy bench-press off the resting sight 
 Icicle atmosphere surface corpse of a once lovely now ugly demeanor 
 Yanked out the grab bag of poison [?splotches?] "Presto change!" 
 [?the voyage botches, the boy-a watches?] unconditionally 
 Bully up in a mixed species for the stargazers, scruffy puppy dog car chasers 
 "That's right" I amaze the hex enough to breathe for a second 
 But in that same breath, he reloads his weapon 
 It's bigger than the most rugged embodiment of malice 
 Dances with the skeletons, and paints a velvet hell I'm in 
 Aside from, slide slick humanoid snake tongue hybrids 
 Stood the net that draped over my TV set 
  
 (Hook) 
 It's I against it, Jinx Planet 
 It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet 
 Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7 
  
 It's I against it, Jinx Planet 
 It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet 
 Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7 
  
  
  
 (Verse 2) 
 It's a Jinx Planet, jeopardy on the canvas 
 Tryin' to shepherd leopards from the archive and the annex 
 Like maggots gut the belly of that fallen elk 
 Human barnacles starship kamikaze to market to buy and sell 
 He said there ain't gone' be no revolution 'til the mutants fell 
 To my sweet lullaby, now they gonna scuttle by speechless 
 The yes-men nod in perfect syncopation, statin' SURE!! 
 But I leave my sures/shores to the beaches, where the hell-nos wash up frequent 
 "Stuck in a mortal" Stuck in a mortal mannerisms with a definite death 
 Flashing the etiquette of veteran gems 
 My tenement stems from where the burners burn best 
 "Stuck walking  a flat Earth simulation murder churn fest" Blatant! 
 Primal traitor defiling all the parties purity 
 [?Pushing this bold least bound?] cross breath meshed with king of pain elixir senseless 
 Drink and purge a thousand years of resentment in seconds 
 "And right then I broke his weapon" 
 [?Left?] things forever in a plank, like ain't no dragon alien of Fahrenheit infinite measure 
 Swift peregrine falcon split [?tether in between?] this planet's tilt 
 Around the wretched refuse Aesop and his little cannon built 
 We thrive in the event horizons offering 
 Slide to the event's half baked subsidiaries when 
 Every enriching stitch wishes to back themselves out of a hidden [?wink?] 
 Cycling the brink of something makers more beautiful than this link 
  
 (Hook) 
 It's I against it, Jinx Planet 
 It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet 
 Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7 
  
 It's I against it, Jinx Planet 
 It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet 
 Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7I could make 'em all dance, or I could sleep 
 I could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete 
 People are made of match sticks, light this bread a flames 
 Note at the craft work door the last smirk of the the Damien mainframe 
 My box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets 
 Inhabit ocean bottoms with a bitter rotten scapegoat pardons (note to self) 
 Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies 
 Where participants squeeze your last giggle then whittle sacrificial finalies 
 I can tie my boot laces alone, save your knee deep offerings 
 Sorta bring puke coughing bunk persona to light (I might) 
 Build malignant(?) railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent 
 Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station 
 What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors? 
 "kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer" 
  
 (dear sir or madam, your son or daughter's embarrassed human kind 
 Consuming booze and gut fuel, till they cruised across the line) 
  
 I spin gold, your raps are dirty lapsed 
 Towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble 
 (yeah I could of been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle) 
 Yeah huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep 
 Towards the right idea {*c'ya* - 5X} 
 This basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic, fold origami 
 Plantation shut this picket fence 
 Hang on to your dreams kitten, you'll probably never hear this song 
 Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen 
  
 (I can smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space 
 Now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face 
 Now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches 
 Do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?) 
  
 Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more 
 I leave footprints in fours, two for bipeds, two more to break the door 
 Practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery(?) brothers and sisters 
 Mothering stickler cabin and madden shit 
 I'll fix the wing for a penny and a parabole, yeah but this friendship 
 Sunk with a barrel full of taros pull 
 Snake eyes harbor bad shiners 
 Then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending 
 Want's garbage bag liners (??????) 
 With out the apple seed it's useless (I sat for greed) 
 Patched for boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks (I sat to breath) 
 I breath to hard nearly metamorph castle loose pins 
 Now I stand to breath as not to disturb the plumage 
 And I know that's not a story, it no longer turns my stomach 
 Hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit 
 But a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it 
 Win a ticket to ride white lines highway sideways melt it smelt it 
 One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of 
 Laughter bats that hung from my rafters 
 See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses 
 That clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck) 
 Now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in 
 But I ain't about to say that I'm the only cat you got bubbling 
 You're lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people 
 Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure 
  
 (knock the fuck off, kicking his lip across the floor 
 'til the archival vinyl venom soak velour 
 Anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners 
 Fusing a million majesty murders then stole the crown) 
  
 Oh wait that's right, you discovered me right? 
 Offered up the peace pipe, and oh 
 It's all cotton candy when Aesop Rock the B light 
 He's actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks 
 (oh we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks) 
 Oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle 
 Built foundation out of passion and brothers dusty taskings 
 Studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems and syllable placement 
 Your just mad cuz somewhere in there you came and went (I ain't the type to dwell) 
 Dismissed it as casually non-compatible and bounced 
 Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like 
 (damn that sounds fresh) or (damn that shit is garbage, what happened? 
 I mean I'm not even laughing) 
 Yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked) 
 You made comments to the wrong Vulvan(?) who out of respect and honor leaked your program 
 Now like were both trying to sit and breath another dawn so my advice 
 To you is when I say just "move on" {*move on* - 5X}GUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
 • a.r. • 
 Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops 
 High noon was your basic whoʼs who of brutal truth 
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance 
 Turn a youngʼn to a dozen paper dolls holding hands 
 And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch 
 So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore 
 I was on the ladder with a lotta dot pawns 
 So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn 
 Pass the popcorn 
 Brawl fair, cop car 
 Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters 
 Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring 
 Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens 
 Packed to the very last rafter 
 Clung to the rafts and the Cameras to capture the damage 
 Neck swivel with a chop-chop volley 
 Where the ants leave nothing but the bones and the car keys 
 Pardon if his Ttwo feet fester 
 It was rude of me people 
 Meet left and lefter 
 Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector 
 But never got his extra extra! 
 Peace for the better but it wasnʼt entertaining 
 So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven 
 Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up 
 Cuz bumper cars are only funny when they bump. know that 
  
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance 
 Popcorn, pocorn 
 Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance 
 Capture the damage, capture the damage

 Tune to hellemundo for action packed blasphemy

 Deployed devoid, with grin to watch laughingly

 Pass the pʼs itʼs a laugh in, I can smell the tragedy 
 When hatchinʼ 
 Happily dispassionately patched in, alive with the menace of demise 
 Like "yes!" the pain dazzles... 
 Man 
 Pass the popcorn, pass the popcorn 
 Itʼs reality at its fastest 
 And yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses 
 Like it's the last of the seconds 
 Before the worst of disasters stretch past us 
 Wouldnʼt you agree that it is fabulous? 
 In the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically 
 Til it fits, I adjust to climates or the wilderness 
 Walk along my spine take the pilgrimage 
 Up into the section thatʼs reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses 
 Work you motherfuckers 
 Hooray! 
 Thereʼs all day to die 
 Innovate the mayhem with grace, the good form-fall 
 Fuck if Iʼm ʻa warn yʼall, now I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw 
 Sixty thousand watts of that raw

 Look at how they bathe up in that dove blood 
 Itʼs gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of

 Yo, it was a lazy day, it was amazing grace 
 It was a half-a-Dozen claymores daisy-chained 
 It wasnʼt daisies and crazy Eights 
 It was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves And saints 
 And every trainee face-painted, while his great escape 
 Grazed and ate 
 Heʼll never make it 
 When he aims he shakes 
 And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door 
 With a couple milk duds 
 And buckets of popcorn 
 Pass the popcorn 
 Clap clap, encore 
 Monkey in the middle study how 
 The bunker took the missiles 
 Age of Machines with nary a green screen 
 So the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems 
 I could tell the pet from the vet 
 Money where his canineʼs spread and never welched on a bet 
 That said, know the over-under on your local hunter 
 And youʼll profit off his widow-makerʼs numbers every summer 
 Bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release ʻem? 
 Has he mercy, will he hack em to pieces? 
 Is he Dirty, will he hassle policeman 
 And security breach

 Leak 
 Over the circuitry?

 And for christʼs sake get this man a doctorI'm in a red zone 
 That's my miracle meridian 
 Boundaries lined with my minute men

 While timidly crash-test authors spawn mountains of trash novels

 Sportin' super-fresh caffeinated-hate 
 Raise amalgamated shakes for the shield (yeah) 
 Yield to the mood slopes 
 With blue notes the silent launch lifted but I think the ground shifted when I walked 
 Yeah I'm the very model of a modern major general

 And on and on and on 
 The limelight stays on and on and on 
 The limelight stays on and on and on 
 The limelight 
 So we got something built if we all die tonight

 She think she piss champagne and shit caviar 
 Don't watch the stars, the stars ain't fallin 
 Any sight of glimmer...Lo 
 Shimmering king, spring, they're tremb-ling 
  
 [Aesop Rock] 
 OK, the web (web) spread (spread) from Brooklynites to born in barn kittens 
 Who's gimpy half step hid behind Noah's Arc systems 
 Inconspicuously clustered with the boas, sharks and pigeons 
 Like Zoo York won't clock them rusted crutches up mopping the ship deck 
 Texas hold 'em pocket ace investment 
 Totem altimeter tiki torch it 
 Freak abort, fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress 
 That's a sheep corpse who under penumbra turned tail like a sea horse 
  
 [Geechi Suede] 
 We got that...permanent ink, that's stainin' the paper 
 Murderer's drink steamin' my soul, I'm breathing green vapors 
 We them last of them falcons that's soarin' beyond your altitude 
 Please show us some gratitude, we're carvin' your grave for you

 16 D batteries, bag it up 
 See the halflings flee the Shire before he tore open the packaging 
 Plus, minus, in proper Panasonic alignment 
 Pseudo Pliskins O.D. on kick drums 
 Snake, escape THAT environment 
  
 [Geechi Suede] 
 Wave that colt .44 
 Bolts of lightning with Travolta grease 
 Strip your skeleton, it's swelterin' inside Miami Heat 
 Your fishnet and red vette are sizzling 
 Shoot through chocolate city 
 Wonder Woman went whistling 
 Freeze, presidential sleaze with Egyptian cuts 
 Valentine Ave., Jack Daniels out of them plastic cups 
 Winter white pinstripe lookin' Hugo 
 Poison Ivy out the windpipe blowin' the crucial

 First they line up 
 We'll divide them 
 Suede get the Roscoe, then design 'em 
 Aesop Rock box, drop the hot rod getaway car 
 And head up the rock highway

 I don't need a reason to rebel 
 I sneak into the club I ain't leaving without a pelt 
 For the people feeling need to sleep i leaguered at the helm 
 Tryna' ease up out the nucleus and bleed into the hills 
 I'm a, old seed dog sippin' on fizz 
 My olk still put skate stickers on the fridge 
 Ate dinner at the Denny's with a dumbed out coven 
 And a company of uninvited blood hounds huffin' 
 Tough crowd, eat and chew the crud king, aw crud 
 I'm day one and two and one thing 
 None drum up any drama for the huffy 
 I ain't even lift the glove up out the pockets of the puffy

 Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump 
 Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once—pale horse painted gunmetal black 
 Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat 
 Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span 
 Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading 
 For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37 
 2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 busses 
 Fireproof and festive 
 Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign 
 Knows no zen in the art of maintenance 
 Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby 
 Here is how a great escape goes when you can’t take your dead friends names out your phone

 Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief 
 Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep 
 Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 The man-ape translates glam thru the visor 
 Goes in water lillies 
 Am-scrays Giger, and man—ray 
 Crammed in a one-player campaign 
 Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain 
 Span where the praying hands mandate 
 Bars an extension of the arms 
 They're mutating instead of being farmed 
 Tonight beneath a marmalade venus 
 Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us 
 Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus 
 All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused 
 Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly 
 And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee 
 Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring 
 And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie 
 The scarf thank Mom’s new hobby, kssssht! copy

 [Verse 3] 
 It was less of an act of hubris 
 More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet 
 Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia 
 Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer 
 I crowbar into the pecking order 
 The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers 
 Hug a double yellow spine 
 Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope 
 Those little fuckers run on passion alone 
 This is the product of a d.i.y. inadequate home 
 Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge 
 Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome 
 Traffic amassed against insufferable odds 
 Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone 
 I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me 
 All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling 
 Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil

 Like this cats is like fish 
 Flowing in the ocean of my emotions 
 I'm often lost in isreal burning in the hell 
 Want in the flow with gift fly like them birds on the block they load again 
 I' m all days trapped in the fields watching  the sky 
 Is thinking itself was the war for life then i learn 
 That are first on mic shining fine and purified earth with lines 
 Feenin as a pigeon that turn phoenix screaming : we only living 
 Want we got it so freedom remembering  days when rap to the eaten 
 Got a light spit this rap with the meaning 
 Define  that reasons while nigga breathin 
 A they key  wors  . . .. 
 Mic is feenin, strike even straight from the heart 
 Escape the sky's limit due music 
 And this is how we do this

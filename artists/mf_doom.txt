[Intro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl, MF DOOM] 
 Mic Check 
 When I was led to you 
 I knew you were the one for me 
 Come through dig the sound 
 I swear the whole world could feel you MC 
 Crowd around 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop 
 Hold mics like pony tails tied in bobbalobs 
 Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound 
 Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around 
 Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap 
 It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strap 
 Femstat cats get kidnapped 
 Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that 
 Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility 
 Broken household name usually said in hostility 
 Um... what is MF? You silly 
 I'd like to take "Means to the End" for two milli' 
 "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double 
 Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo 
 Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black 
 Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac 
  
 [Hook: MF DOOM] 
 On Doomsday!, ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say 
 Right above my government; Dumile 
 Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say? 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section 
 If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then 
 Cell number 17, up under the top bunk 
 I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk 
 Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped 
 God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape 
 Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children 
 One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building 
 While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer 
 I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer 
 A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime 
 Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime 
 Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste 
 Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent 
 And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness 
 Real mens mind their own business 
 That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch 
 How come I hold the microphone double-clutch 
 C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found 
 On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown 
  
 [Hook: MF DOOM] 
 On Doomsday! 
 Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went 
 That's what my tomb will say 
 Right above my government; Dumile 
 Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say? 
  
 [Bridge: MF DOOM] 
 Doomsday 
 Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence 
 Read it off the tomb 
 Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say? 
  
 [Verse 3: MF DOOM] 
 Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say" 
 Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk 
 I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk 
 Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang 
 Nicknames of nimble and tip of nipple metal fang 
 Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang 
 Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans 
 Only gin and Tang 
 Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang 
 Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth 
 It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth 
 I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth 
 Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth 
 But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce 
 So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife 
 Strong enough to please a wife 
 Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life 
 Cut the crap far as rap 
 Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing 
 What the Devil? He's on another level 
 It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain! 
  
 [Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl] 
 When I was led to you 
 I knew you were the one for me 
 I swear the whole world could feel you MC[Produced by Metal Fingers] 
  
 [Skit 1] 
 Now I haven't eaten all day. How am I gonna do this man? 
 Yeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her 
 I'll tell you what man: come with me now and you know 
 I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something 
 I got a little bank, y'know, no problem 
 I hear you, that's cool (alright? It's cool) 
 Man, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man? 
 Yo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry 
 Yo let him come back 
  
 [Skit 2] 
 Here you will find food for your body 
 As well as comfort for your troubled mind 
 I'd really like some soup (bread and butter) 
 Of course my friend. What happened to your hand? 
 Oh, food at last! 
  
 [Skit 3] 
 How did they get here? 
 Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food 
 What other food? 
 Fish (food) protein (fast for ya) 
  
 [Skit 4] 
 Now what happened? 
 Well, the cop got 
 The next morning I went to the store to get some food 
 (Bread and butter) They arrested me 
 I'll save you (thank you) 
 Would you like a snack? 
 Thanks for the drink 
  
 [Skit 5] 
 Operation Doomsday complete 
 All your intercoms casualty and damage testing 
  
 [Skit 6] 
 Enough! you talk of the people's rights 
 The people have only those rights which I choose to give them 
 And that's for their own good, believe me 
 I do, DOOM 
 They dissappoint me, they must work faster 
 What about the prisoner? 
 Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me 
 Watch him. I have special plans for that one 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped 
 Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap 
 I suggest you change your diet 
 It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it 
 Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease 
 It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze 
 Take the easy way out phony, until then 
 They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen 
 So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this 
 They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice 
 Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet 
 Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it 
 He be better off on PC glued 
 And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood 
 Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed 
 (Food, we need food!) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh 
 A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous 
 Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit 
 They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit 
 Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell 
 Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel 
 Keep a cooker where the jar fell 
 And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell 
 Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears 
 Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares 
 The odd pair swears and God fears 
 Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years 
 I wrote this note around New Year's 
 Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares? 
 Enough about me, it's about the beats 
 Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat 
 A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical 
 Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral 
 It's a miracle how he get so lyrical 
 And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual 
 For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello 
 Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello 
 We hollow krills, she swallow pills 
 He follow flea collar three dollar bills 
 And squeal for halal veal, if y'all appeal 
 Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal 
 Twirl a L after every meal (food!) 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 What up? 
 To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up 
 And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up 
 Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males? 
 Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales 
 They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales 
 Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales 
 This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail 
 Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale 
 Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby 
 After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby 
 He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit 
 Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it? 
 Punk, try and ask why ours be better 
 Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater 
 Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude 
 (We need food!)[Intro: Mr. Fantastik & (MF DOOM)] 
 Yo! (Yo!) 
 MF DOOM (Mr. Fantastik) 
 Mr. Fantastik (Villain) 
 What up, nigga? (Ain't nuttin; what's the word?) 
 What's cracking, boy? (Same ol' shit, kid) 
 Man (Different day, you know?) 
 These rap snitches, man, shit is bugged out, man 
 What the fuck, man? (Shit, you telling me) 
 Niggas running their mouth, telling e'rything, e'rything (critical) 
  
 [Hook: Mr. Fantastik] 
 Rap snitches, telling all their business 
 Sit in the court and be their own star witness 
 Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here 
 Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years 
 Rap snitches, telling all their business 
 Sit in the court and be their own star witness 
 Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here 
 Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years 
  
 [Verse 1: Mr. Fantastik] 
 Type profile low, like A in "Paid in Full" 
 Attract heavy cash cause the game's centrifugal 
 Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic 
 Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic 
 Can't stand a brown nosing nigga, fake ass bastard 
 Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan 
 Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest 
 My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest 
 Street nigga, stamped and bonafide 
 When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride 
 True to the ski mask, New York's my origin 
 Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion 
 According to him, when the D's rushed in 
 Complication from the wire testimony was thin 
 Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again 
 Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican 
  
 [Hook: Mr. Fantastik] 
 Rap snitches, telling all their business 
 Sit in the court and be their own star witness 
 Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here 
 Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years 
 Rap snitches, telling all their business 
 Sit in the court and be their own star witness 
 Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here 
 Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care 
 Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear 
 Yeah, yeah, tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill 
 Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still 
 Informer, keep it up and get tested 
 Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted 
 He keep a lab down south in the little beast 
 So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East 
 A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning 
 Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning 
 Hitting on many trees, feel real linen 
 Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men 
 Where no brains but gum flap 
 He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (pap!) 
 Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches 
 Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes 
  
 [Outro: Mr. Fantastik & (MF DOOM)] 
 You know what I'm saying? (It's terrible) 
 Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game 
 This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching 
 Telling on they own self (it's a horror, yo) 
 Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man 
 (Atrocities) Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga 
 You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging 
 Fake hustling nigga, heheheheh, haha 
 Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here...[Intro] 
 Keep your hoes in check... 
 (Super!) 
  
 [Verse] 
 I got this girl and she wants me to duke her 
 I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said ("Super!") 
 That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper 
 No matter what I need her to do, she be like ("Super!") 
 Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa 
 On the microphone he flossed the ring ("Super!") 
 Average emcees is like a TV blooper 
 MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper 
 Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit 
 Just to cool her off she said niggas ain't about shit 
 I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it 
 The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it 
 And can't live with this, handle your business 
 Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list 
 One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper 
 It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ("Super!") 
 Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow 
 Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low 
 Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident 
 DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent 
 Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent 
 A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went 
 I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla 
 Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her 
 No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang 
 Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang 
 Same name on the titty as on the name ring 
 Pretty like Baby D off "All in the Same Gang" 
 Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her 
 But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut 
 And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa 
 Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ("Super!") 
 See most cats treat her like Foofur 
 Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ("Super!") 
 You need to make her feel cuter 
 And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ("Super!") 
 Do for her, keep her in a new fur 
 So she look sweet when she go to meet the ("Super!") 
 Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it 
 Put it in the air, come here, kiss it 
 Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you 
 When she's on the rag, never let her fry the Ragu 
 Which'll have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo" 
 Her name on your back in a tattoo 
 Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick 
 Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik 
 You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her 
 And be a father to your child like the ("Super!") 
 He keep his hoes in check 
 Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks 
 Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real 
 Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal 
 Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel 
 Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel 
 And while he's running down to All-Star Weekend to ball 
 I'm coming with the U-Haul ("Super!") 
 ("Super! Super!") 
  
 [Outro Skit] 
 (DOOM): Has the laser cannon been lowered? 
 (DOOM Cronie): Everything has been prepared as you ordered. But how did you get permission to return to New York master? 
 (DOOM): Through the efforts of the misguided fools 
 (J. Jonah Jameson): It's free enterprise, and I'm not gonna have some blasted government bureaucrat tell me how to run my business. But DOOM will be my guest on my private estate in Long Island. There's nothing you can do about it 
 (Jameson Employee): He's dangerous, I just hope you know what you're doing 
 (Jay Jonah Jameson):  Don't I always. Ah, there's DOOM's jet, right on time 
  
 (Voice 1): Why's it so cold out here? 
 (Voice 2): The heat went out in the whole building 
 (Voice 3): It's warming up out there in Long Island with DOOM 
 (Voice 1): DOOM? Here in New York? 
 (Voice 2): Yes DOOM has an amazing new machine 
  
 (DOOM): Get the president of the United States on the phone 
 (Jay Jonah Jameson): How long's all this gonna take, DOOM? 
 (DOOM): I would not advise you to repeat that error 
 (Jay Jonah Jameson): Sure, I know what you mean[Intro] 
 Before we go any further 
 Friends 
  
 [Verse] 
 As you call 'em, they call you when they need something 
 Trees for the blunt, the G's for the front 
 I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone 
 Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone 
 Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life 
 Just so you could feel me like a steel knife 
 At least so you could see the white of they eyes 
 Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies 
 Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies 
 Close, but really don't know me 
 Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies 
 Some come around when they need some money 
 Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies 
 Fam be around whether you paid or bummy 
 You could either ignore this advice or take it from me 
 Be too nice and people take you for a dummy 
 So nowadays he ain't so friendly 
 Actually they wouldn’t have made a worthy enemy 
 Read the signs: "No feeding the baboon" 
 Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds 
 Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance 
 Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance 
 Never let your so-called mans know your plans 
 (How many of us have them?) A show of hands 
 (Friends) is a term some people use loosely 
 I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see 
 You telling me; I try to act broke 
 Jealousy the number one killer among black folk 
 Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke 
 Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc 
 Just another way a chick'll lead to your end 
 I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend 
 It said: person, one who likes to socialize with 
 Sympathiser, helper, and that's about the size of it 
 Most of the time these attributes is one-sided 
 To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid 
 And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch 
 Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch 
 (Click!) And when things get quiet 
 Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot 
 I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal 
 Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel 
 When it get for real, steel get to sparkin' 
 Everything darken, and ain't no talkin' 
 For somethin so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble 
 Ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble 
 Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is 
 (One's we can depend on, friends) 
 Some come in the form of codependence 
 A lot of times only end up being codefendants 
 Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence 
 And leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance 
 It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty? 
 Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty 
 I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory 
 (How many of us have--) a similar story 
 (Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing 
 Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know it's no strings 
 We could do the damn thing, but ho, it's no rings 
 Just how the tramp swings 
 Will she see 'em again? 
 That depends on how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons 
 It ain't no need to pretend 
 Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they're just friends 
  
 [Outro] 
 Friends 
 How many of us have them? 
 Friends 
 Ones we can depend on? 
 Friends 
 How many of us have them? 
 Friends 
 Before we go any further 
  
 [Skit] 
 Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are! 
 And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crack' 
 (Negro humor always escaped me.) 
  
 [Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman); 
 Dr. DOOM; Character 2] 
 The most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world 
 Guided by a fighting force that never sleeps 
 That never relaxes its vigilance 
 For none is as feared, none has as many foes 
 As DOOM, the awesome ironclad lord of 
 I know who Doom is (Then tell us) 
 He happens to be the most dangerous man in the world 
 I’d hope we’d never hear from him 
 I’d hope we’d never have to battle him 
 But now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we’re up against 
 I first met DOOM years ago 
 When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments 
 One day while conducting a secret experiment 
 [Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries 
 Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful 
 [Woman screams] What have I done to myself? 
 My face, it is hideous 
 He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face 
 (I’m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you) 
 He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen 
 He continued his search, never showing his face 
 Unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers 
 Who foolishly wander alone through their domain[Intro] 
 I get no kick from champagne 
 Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all 
 So tell me why shouldn't it be true? 
 I get a kick out of brew 
  
 [Verse] 
 There's only one beer left 
 Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf 
 Tempt me, do a number on the label 
 Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table 
 Like, "It's on me—put it on my tab, kid" 
 However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it 
 You're leaving on your face, forfeit 
 I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it 
 Told him tell her they stole it, he told her he lost it 
 She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit 
 Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads 
 It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds 
 It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off 
 Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough 
 They group been soft 
 First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off 
 He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road 
 She asked him autograph her derriere, read 
 "To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd 
 Love, Villain." Take pride in code words 
 Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart 
 Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart 
 Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy 
 No he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye 
 And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel 
 The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel 
 They call the super when they need their back, uhh, plumbing fixed 
 "How there only one left? The pack comes in six! 
 Whatever happened to two and three?" 
 A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like, "What you doing G? 
 Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy 
 Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!" 
 Looser than a pair of Adidas 
 I hope you brought your spare tweeters, MC's sound like cheerleaders 
 Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin 
 DOOM came do his thing again, no matter who be blingin' 
 He do it for the smelly hubbies 
 Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Tellie Tubbies 
 Few can do it, even fewer can sell it 
 Take it from the dude who wears mask like a 'tarded helmet 
 He plots shows like robberies 
 In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please 
 Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt 
 The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Bring heat like your boy done gone to war 
 He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!" 
 A whole string of jobs like we on tour 
 Every night on the score, coming to your corner store 
  
 [Skit] 
 There, it is done 
 Now that the representative from South Africa has been mind programmed 
 All of the world leaders on earth are under my control 
 And when they meet tomorrow in special session 
 I, Doom, shall be voted: Master of the World 
 My plan is foolproof, but just in case 
 And what about snow? 
  
 [Skit 2] 
 Now you keep your eyes open 
 When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure) 
 Uh, ladies and gentlemen 
 I am risking my life to tell you with great concern that I must warn you 
 I, I, you must listen 
 Many among you, have, have, have their minds taken over 
 (What a story, start snappin’) 
 DOOM, gosh, I wish I’d brought my autograph book 
 (Your attempts at humor bore me) Right lead head 
 You’re weird 
 Why is everyone staring at us? 
 (Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them) 
 Relax masseur, just do your thing 
 (Get a good grip on my-) 
 What? Why I’ll bend your read out meter for ya, you little 
 (Knock it off, Ben) 
 What’s the matter? (Oh, Ben) 
 You’re nothing but a chicken head 
 (You overgrown granite head) Hold it 
  
 [Produced by Madlib][Intro] 
 Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here 
 In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare 
 Loud enough to burst his right eardrum, close-range 
 The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I sell rhymes like dimes 
 The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick 
 Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick 
 A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show 
 So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo 
 Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game 
 Came back from five years laying and stayed the same 
 I'm saying, electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock 
 And G-Shocks her biological clock 
 When I hit it, slit it to the shitter,  thought I killed her goose 
 Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice 
 Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him 
 Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him 
 Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny 
 The only thing that come between us is krill and money 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I sell rhymes like dimes 
 The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not 
 If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along 
 Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks 
 Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks 
 Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe 
 To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro 
 This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks 
 "Oh, you're too kind!" "Really? Thanks!" 
 To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine" 
 He hold his heart when he telling rhyme 
 When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven 
 He nasty like the old time Old No. 7 
 You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola 
 Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola 
 I told her, "No credit for a bag 
 If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gack" 
 Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck 
 And still keep your attitude on self-destruct 
  
 [Chorus] 
 I sell rhymes like dimes 
 The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick 
 Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick 
 A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show 
 So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo 
 Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game 
 Came back from five years laying and stayed the same 
 Saying, "Electromagnetic feeling blocks all logical, Spock" 
 And G-Shocks her biological clock 
 When I hit it, slit her to the shitter,  thought I killed her goose 
 Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice 
 Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him 
 Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him 
 Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny 
 The only thing that come between us is krill and money 
  
 [Chorus] 
 We sell rhymes like dimes 
 The one who mostly keep cash but tell em bout the broke times 
  
 [Bridge: Sample] 
 "In your arms tonight 
 She'll reflect 
 That she owes you the sweetest of debts 
 If she wants to pay" 
  
 [Outro: Cucumber Slice] 
 Check it out, y'all! Ya don't stop! Keep on, to the sure shot! 
 Huh-ha! Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh! 
 Yeah, you're listening to the buttery slickness 
 The Land-O-Lakes from my man MF DOOM! 
 Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! 
 Rock-shocking the house, with another nugget 
 Uh-uh-ah, eh, oh, ah, hoo-wee! 
 Yeah! Yeah! 
 Regulation status, right here 
 Fondle 'Em Recordings, 1999 
 Yeah! 
 Now what are you 'posed to say on the end of records? 
 I don't know! Yeah! Woo! Yeah! 
 Mashed potatoes! 
 Apple sauce! 
 Buttery... biscuits! 
 And I get lost 
 A yes, yes, yes, yes y'all 
 You don't stop 
 Keep on, a' to the break-a-dawn 
 Say what? 
 Uh! 
 Yeah! 
 You thought it all was over! 
 You thought the song was over! 
 Ah! We tricked you! We tricked you! 
 Ha ha ha ha... Woo! 
 You listening to www  dot hairline dot com 
 MF DOOM, Kool Bob Love...[Verse] 
 Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke 
 Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke 
 Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning 
 Torn in, poor men sworn in 
 Cornish hens switching positions, auditioning morticians 
 Saw it in a vision, ignoring prison 
 Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb 
 Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung 
 Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail 
 Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers 
 Seven figures invigor 
 Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male 
 Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea 
 Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees 
 Trees is free, please leave a key 
 These meagre fleas, he's the breeze 
 And she's the bees knees for sheez 
 G's of G's 
 Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese 
 Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa! 
 DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya 
 Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama 
 Pull a card like oh drama 
 Civil liberties 
 These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C 
 Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy 
 Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically 
 Don't expect to see the recipe 
 Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee 
 More wreck than Section Z 
 What you expect to get for free? 
 Shit from me, history 
 The key, plucked it off the mayor 
 Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player 
 They say he's gone too far 
 DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!! 
 Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr 
 The rumors are not true, got two ma 
 No prob, got the job, hot-barred heart throb 
 Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob 
 Bake a cake, sweet 
 Jamaica trade in treats on the beach 
 Make her skeet til her feets meet 
  
 Can it be I stayed away too long? 
 Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone? 
 As you listen to these crazy tracks 
 Check them stats then you know where I'm at 
 And that's that 
  
 [Audio Clip: Unknown, Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd] 
 Look, there's Doom now! 
 I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him 
 That's right! You'll never stop me! You're dead! You're all dead! Doom![Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 It ain't nothing like a fistfull a cash or a bliss fulla the hash 
 That twist like a mustache, from end to end, spread it like a rash 
 From talking through your walkman or at your disco bash 
 Gimme the Timbs Rumplestiltskin brown 
 A metal face mask with a built in frown 
 A mic to tilt down, a hundred thousand pounds 
 And see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown 
  
 Cocoa butter on very ashy day fam 
 With Ray-Bans out on the islands of Cayman 
 Or i'll break it down for the layman 
 Bain de Soliel, for that St. Tropez tan 
 A can a ole gold too cold to hold, slow ya roll 
 Keep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough 
 Like a fool who stole pity y'all 
 From tryna go up against city hall titty bar 
 The black mic is like a red violin 
 Ok, everybody back to the lab, try again 
 Bloody rap game like leviathan 
 Leave a bad taste, killin my high like niacin 
 Stop kiddin middlemen need Ritalin 
 Hit me with the full tin of gin and im a kid again 
 Keep the bong lightin straight through the song writin 
 The Supervillain AKA the thong bitin, thats inviting all 
 To the recitin thats dope and raw 
 Hoping all yall come in peace and its open bar 
 Tear the roof off this bumba rasclaat 
 By the end of the night spazz like shazbot 
 Spilt a shot made the pen lines runny 
 A ill plot thats ten times Ben Stien money, funny 
 How he rips the scripts with a straight face 
 With more rhymes than is lines in ya database 
 Placing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless 
 With this food for thought sorta like breakfast 
 You could mark it off as wreck on the checklist 
 Wear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace 
 Shit, that there, could go to help them daycares 
 Somebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!) 
 Pay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers his shares 
 And y'all could pay DOOM in beers; cheers! 
  
 [Verse 2: RZA] 
 I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar 
 The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers 
 Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned 
 And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at 
 Home 
 This dates back to 1555 
 When they captured the first tribe of men 
 And piled them in a pen 
 Fifty feet high 
 They took em all on a 9000 mile ride 
 And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before 
 But read about this inside the ancient books of war 
 Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language 
 Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless 
 Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins 
 And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion 
 Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part 
 The devils cursed God and reversed God 
 And turned God into dog and made people search hard 
 No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud 
 To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados 
 Tobagos, separated us from slave boats 
 Made our own brothers hate us 
 From Virgin Isle to Jamaica 
 Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada 
 Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement 
 You black gods become awaken[Verse] 
 It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes 
 Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes 
 Real rhymes not your everyday hologram 
 Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham 
 He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad 
 It might need salt like your man's bland ballad 
 A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's 
 Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose 
 Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly 
 Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy 
 Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy 
 Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy, funk me" 
 I'm like, "Anywho's" 
 Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes 
 I guess it's better than some funky socks 
 You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox 
 Instead she wanna hear the beatbox 
 Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock 
 Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory 
 While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story 
 The mask is like Jason 
 They told the place not to let the basket type case in 
 He could be some kind of wacko 
 Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho 
 He busted in, blessed be the Lord 
 Who believe any mess they read up on a message board 
 If so, I got bridges for the low low 
 Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo 
 Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier 
 Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear 
 It was the shit when I first scooped it 
 At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid 
 Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly 
 Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy 
 Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty 
 Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty 
 Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated 
 In deep theta, let her hate the creep later 
 Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data 
 Say he stay self medicated to sleep later 
 Side effects is similar to sugar pill 
 Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill 
 And made his exit on some calm shit 
 Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit 
 ("Doom!")[Intro] 
 (Hot shit) (aww shit) 
  
 [Verse 1: Count Bass D] 
 I strive to be humble, lest I stumble 
 Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo 
 Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust 
 Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up 
 Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up 
 Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders 
 (Hot shit) 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 What, these old things? About to throw 'em away 
 With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ 
 Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay 
 MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay 
 Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit? 
 Working on a way that we can roll away tinted 
 Some say the price of holding heat is often too high 
 You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy 
 The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie 
 Never too busy when it comes down to you and I 
 (Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die 
 They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry 
 You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot 
 Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat 
 I coulda had a V-8 
 F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight 
 Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy 
 That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie 
 So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted 
 Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered 
 Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit 
 These metal fingers be holding (hot shit) 
  
 [Verse 3: Count Bass D] 
 When I was four, I penned "God Was Born In New York" 
 Back in '77, still got nan in the crescent 
 The effervescence of God's presence is thick 
 Unlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker 
 Peace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers 
 Looked her up and down said, "Hmm, too much makeup" 
 Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up 
 Rappers don't blow up heads do (aww shit) 
 My name is Dwight Spitz, I'mma Sonic addict 
 I use to think it was merely a nagging habit 
 Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine 
 I strive to flip it into fine wine 
 Barely born a virgin is what the stars said 
 Black not white, red all over though like Elmo 
 Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking 
 I make music every weekend 
 It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love 
 I get mad love but I detest the labor 
 And its wages, you know death 
 I'm servin' life from this gift of God 
 Don't forget your potholders, my niggas (more hot shit) 
  
 [Outro] 
 A short time later[Verse 1] 
 Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and 
 Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand 
 Tillin' the wasteland sands 
 Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan 
 He rest when he's ashes 
 Ask 'em after ten miles in his ga-lashes, smashes stashes 
 Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster 
 A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster 
 They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow 
 Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible 
 Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess 
 The ten case of cave a chicken chest S 
 Yes ya'll the dub will get ya trickles 
 The best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels 
 But tut tut, he about to change the price again 
 It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen 
 Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear 
 And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire 
 Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama 
 Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma 
 Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke 
 Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke 
 I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate" 
 He find out later when he tries to go and rep it 
 Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah 
 Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta 
 One monkey don't stop no slaughter 
 A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border 
 Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill 
 Flow skill, still there's no thrill 
 Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla 
 Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with— 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 —Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix 
 Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick 
 Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic 
 Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick 
 Sick slick, hidden in a book 
 The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook 
 Listen, don't look now, keep walkin' 
 Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin' 
 Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often 
 Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then 
 He's like Worf, some say stronger though 
 Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro 
 Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show 
 Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro 
 For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow 
 Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo 
 He's playin' Ray J the old tape 
 DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape 
 Fill it to the rim like brim 
 Villain and ya won't find him in no gym 
 Probably a foggy bog with the frogs 
 With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log 
 Half cocked and half baked 
 Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake 
 My mistake, sign a track agreement 
 For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement 
 In any event it's fake like wrestlin' 
 Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines 
 Ahem, elixir for the dry throat 
 Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote 
 By remote, send in the meat wagon 
 Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin' 
 These stats are staggerin' 
 Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin' 
 Villain, his agenda is clear 
 Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here 
 It's not meant for the seein' 
 Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein' 
 A new meanin' to sales through the roof 
 Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof 
 It's the return of the tramp 
 Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp 
 For the right earn - na'mean like Vern 
 We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn 
 Jiminy crickets 
 He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off SimplyLyrics 
 One man's waste is another man's soap 
 Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope 
 A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow 
 And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow 
 He wears a mask so the charge won't grab 
 On a rooftop with a large stone slab 
 Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish 
 Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish 
 Black licorice and equally as yucky 
 How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie 
 Monkey hustle, man on fire 
 Later for the date than the Hadron Collider 
 And cost more, it be seemin' like a style 
 DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile 
 Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels 
 In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules 
 Fools, the roach was never dead 
 Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head 
 Instead it was depicted as flicked in 
 Split, the wicks lit 
 (Can you dig it?) 
  
 "We have got to try and find DOOM!" 
 "Good luck!"[Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Intro: Dr. Doom] 
 My servants began to forge what was to become 
 The most dreaded costume on the face of the earth 
 The last thing to fit was the mask 
 Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him 
 Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one 
 Can't put shit past him 
 Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him 
 Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man 
 Stand close to his main man like a chain gang 
 Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew 
 That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew 
 Saw her with her drawers down, caught her 
 The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta" 
 I suggest you hand over the formula doula 
 A villain in your land, in his land a ruler 
 Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura 
 Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller 
 Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet 
 No matter how you spell it, we still got beats 
  
 [Verse 2: Kurious + MF DOOM] 
 Don't question how we live, question what we give 
 Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me 
 Still they judge, but they be butt ass 
 Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it 
 Light's the fuel, mic is the tool 
 Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start 
 Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it 
 Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44 
 Contemplate, meditate, dictate 
 I direct my direct fate, coming of late 
 Kurious, can I say, "Shit?" 
 Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit 
 (RIP) 
 K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C 
 (Eternally for M-I-C) 
 Only we save we 
  
 [Interlude: MF DOOM] 
  
 [Verse 3: MF DOOM] 
 By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out 
 Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about 
 Topics and views, generally concerned about 
 With different ways to come up and earn clout 
 I take a look at my life and pace the trails 
 From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils 
 You out your frame but still bagging 'em too 
 You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you 
 Like my twin brother, we did everything together 
 From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers 
 Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys 
 I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles 
 The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock 
 Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block 
 I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand 
 Everything is going according to plan man[Verse: MF DOOM + sample] 
 Darker than the East river, larger than the Empire State 
 Where the beast who guard the barbed wire gate 
 Is on the job—not my fate, tired of the wait 
 'Til the Villain bring deliverance from the dire straits 
 Fire at a higher rate why'd they make the liars? 
 Fliers scatter, buy a plate—isolate the wires 
 Try the straight pliers, if not—the vice grips 
 A real price-saver way to acquire nice whips 
 What a steal for real on wheels of steel 
 Stunner, a funner summer number-one meal deal-bummer 
 A bizarre phenomenon—is your armor on? 
 Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast—Ramadan 
 Transaction drama—aw, come on, Barney 
 Clack, clack—pardon me, wack rap con carne 
 He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers 
 After that, he's going back to Cali, where's the—("—love is—") 
 Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids 
 Of Giza, and stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa 
 Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza 
 Raw with the pen, and on the mic—off the hezza 
 Get shot off that wide-eyed talk 
 If he had a pot—he'd still piss on the sidewalk 
 Can't take the street out the street-person 
 Lookin' for the perfect beat, coercion into heat-burstin' 
 They couldn't spot him on the spot date 
 Got the only tape that come with a free hot-plate 
 Whoever do get to see me sing 
 With the 3-D ring, sittin' stationary like B.B. King 
 Can see how it really sting—it ain't no front row 
 Standing room only at the motocross stunt show 
 The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus 
 Me and Sub' is like the brown Smothers Brothers ("My love is—") 
 Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro 
 If they don't know, fill 'em in tomorrow 
 On the horror show, a mental note: return Bob’s record 
 Swear to God, before he gets a job, he robs Eckerd 
 Blessed with a hot flow—tested—it got dough 
 Invested in stress, the best to finesse an opto 
 As I reminisce, never forgot when I was very broke 
 Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the Cherry Coke 
 Or should I say, broke with wealth? 
 To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self 
 Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it 
 The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it 
 Dog-gone it—do the statistics 
 How he bust lyrics—it's too futuristic for ballistics 
 And far too eccentric for forensics 
 I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the hip-hop Hendrix 
  
 [Outro: Sample + [?]] 
 "In my pocket, a note.  
 It's—from my father." 
 "—from the guard's whip. Is this a trick? 
 Why would I resort to trickery? You're already a prisoner. What do I gain by deceiving you? 
 You can't blame me for being suspicious." 
 "No." 
 Hehe 
  
 [Produced by MF DOOM][Verse 1] 
 It's horrible, one little evening alone, home 
 End up with carpal tunnel syndrome 
 And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches 
 Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes 
 Supposed to be checking emails 
 All I got is messages from ass naked females 
 I don't know a Jenny 
 She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny 
 And that's the last time I saw her 
 But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah 
 And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out 
 And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts 
 I wonder what I owe her 
 For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa 
 ("Nite nite!"), Uh, ok honey, sweet dreams 
 Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans 
 A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt 
 Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk 
 Locked in, looking at your picture 
 Fully clothed winter and I right there with ya 
 Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone 
 A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home 
 Fat chance, at least he get snacks 
 That'd have to do 'til a brother get back 
 Until then smack One-Eyed Jack 
 And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack 
 That's three different flavors 
 Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers 
 Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up 
 I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up 
 Soon as he fell off the beat down 
 All I hear is, "13th cell, put the sheet down" 
 Damn C.O.,, what the hell do she know? 
 Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low 
 A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen 
 Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again 
 In the wee hours, he's gotten farther 
 Needing three showers, being hot and bothered 
 The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant 
 God bless the day she wondered where her egg went 
 I need a L, it's hard to drink without it 
 And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it 
 Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file 
 Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild 
 Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch 
 Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch 
  
 [Instrumental Break] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 He don't mess with the Ritz Bits 
 Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits 
 Matzos or Cheez-Its 
 Catch sugar fits every time that he sees 
 Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk 
 Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk 
 Even the Oreos, no matter what weather 
 Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together 
 In the game he's shameless 
 Even uses a code name: Famous Amos 
 It's cheaper than a short stay at the Day's Inn 
 And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin 
 Give a hand to who invented the camera 
 Skip past the gram animal in Grandma’s 
 Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill 
 Or get caught with a handful of cream fill 
  
 "Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!" 
 It might seem ill 
 "Ew! Go wash your hands!" 
 Kookies 
  
 [Outro: Samples] 
 "DOOM is master of the world." 
 "I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug in my history book." 
 "You've disturbed me for the last time." 
 (Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't all bad 
 (Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben? 
 (Voice 1): Well I gotta admit that I've been having a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black 
 (Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack one more time and send you back then, Benjamin 
 (Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny 
 (Voice 2): He must be mad 
 (Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can 
 (Misc. Voice): Food, we need food[Verse] 
 Give it a sec for the pain to start 
 This wreck right here, it ain't for the faint of heart 
 They thought they saw the worst verse 
 From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first 
 Once they get to know us people dig us 
 Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggas 
 Inventor of the more dementeder flow, no bout a-doubt it 
 This go for if you're bout it bout it or rowdy, rowdy 
 Whatever's clever, the master fold 
 Who every hooker heard of, but now ho know 
 If we see tomorrow, the next day classes 
 The Villain in the back with the x-ray glasses 
 Have no fear, the ninja here 
 Feel 'em like the tinge in your ear from drinking ginger beer 
 When it's on, loco head gon' lay low 
 And heat it like beef patty, coco bread kon queso 
 If you say so lace the whole case load 
 They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show 
 He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's 
 His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos 
 Say, ho, if you never worked a J-O 
 And keep more cash in the stash than a peso 
 Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow 
 Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow 
 Oh, shoot, the goose is loose 
 So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice 
 Frown like the first time you taste cous cous 
 Stash the deuce deuce, troops asking truce, truce 
 Today on intense wreck week 
 We have the super villain in his own defense to speak 
 It's all part of my mental techniques 
 Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks 
 Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought 
 On a campaign trail he came to gain your support 
 Charge cash for a autograph 
 Say some shit to make your daughter laugh then slaughter the ass 
 See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen 
 Do something and never be back once he leaves the scene 
 Keep more medicated pads than Stridex 
 For his own side wreck with no known side effects 
 Before you press charges use your noodle 
 So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles 
 Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful 
 It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo 
 Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it 
 From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate 
 Soon as he stepped in, he lit the room 
 Boom, reschedule my noon with Britt Hume 
 (Doom!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing 
 Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain 
 Maintain and say it, don't spray it 
 You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it 
 If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns 
 I'll have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds 
 When I was broker than a broke dick dog 
 I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog 
 When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm 
 I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms 
 One, two, microphone checker 
 First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker 
 This is back when he was like crib age 
 When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage 
 Break the mic like a rock star, break a guitar 
 And jump off the stage like, "Yee haw!" 
  
 [Outro Skit] 
 (UN leader): We shall now vote for a new world leader. I nominate, DOOM. All in favor, say I 
 (Delegates (In unison)): I 
 (Peter Parker): Oh no 
 (DOOM): DOOM is master of the world 
  
 (Voice 1): We must hurry 
 (Voice 2): If you are really with us, prove it. Let me hear you say it. Tell me that DOOM is a tyrant and must be overthrown 
 (Voice 1): I-I have spent my life 
 (Voice 2): Say it! You have spent your life serving a tyrant. DOOM must be stopped 
 (Voice 1): I fear you're right, my friend 
  
 (DOOM Cronie): The President of the United States is on the phone 
 (DOOM): Mr. President, you're at the mercy of your deadliest enemy 
 (President): It is time you learned once and for all, DOOM. The united states does not barter with terrorists 
 (DOOM): You never learn, do you? 
  
 (Voice 1): Here, this is the address of friends in New York. They'll help[Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys 
 Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop) 
 In a instant get smoked like Winston Cigarettes 
 Ho's get ripped off like Nicorette patch 
 In real life the real trife scene 
 Might snatch ya life like assault machine 
 Rifle, dead up setup like bull-fight 
 Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight 
 The unemotional call me anti-social 
 On the run off the gun death tally commercial 
 Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets 
 To my peeps G.M MF on the beat 
 Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war 
 So keep from steppin on my floor or delivery front door 
 I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers master yours 
 My disaster cause: Hell.. in gas drawls 
 The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillins 
 Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians 
 Dont make me have to hurt them feelings 
 I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin in my dealings (WHILE I’M) 
 Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin' 
 Dome blown within the comforts of your own home 
 Grown big wheelin' and high rollin' 
 I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen' 
 Holdin, foldin the pal 
 Known as massive-versatile 
 I’d like to big-em-up monster isle 
  
 [Break: MF DOOM] 
 Uummm, Yeah 
 I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls 
 Mhm 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 To my brother Subroc and Black Ju 
 I crack brew for, two more, three men, two up 
 I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels 
 When giving crews a brush with death like between meals 
 Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose 
 With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose 
 X the suspicious flirter 
 Who every hooker hearda', next to malicious murda' 
 A track type vicious fulfillin the pipe wishes 
 The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle 
 Any given summer's eve don't breathe 
 Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve 
 Master of the O who predict ya last pause 
 I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls 
 Breakin glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law 
 Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four (invisible bitch) 
 Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state 
 The ho better settle case 
 The flow is at pedal pace steady like tricycles 
 Beware all suckas is froze like icicles (bag 'em up) 
 And baggin' bitches like nickels 
 Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though 
 I'ma split till I pronounce More hits than a ounce no doubt 
 About ta bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out 
  
 [Outro: MF DOOM 
 And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar 
 Megalon and King Geedorah 
 I call this joint right here Gas Drawls 
 In Hell with yours[Sample] 
 One more beer 
 And I'll take you all 
 All of you 
  
 [Intro] 
 Banned from all bars 
 The man with seven scars 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell 
 Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale 
 Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail 
 Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell? 
 Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well 
 Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail 
 If all else fail, inhale the L 
 Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail 
 Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer 
 DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her 
 "My black sister!" She said, "Step back!" before he kissed her 
 She did the dipper and the smack just missed her 
 There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger 
 99% of rap's just a friendly listener 
 I'm like, "These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all" 
 Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball 
 Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come 
 Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums 
 Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em 
 Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm 
 Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika? 
 One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker 
 Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka! 
 A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker 
 For yo' information, I didn't do the beat, y'all 
 It ain't my fault if she didn't move her feet at all 
 Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul 
 So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball 
  
 [Chorus] 
 She better have my scrilla 
 Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly 
 Remind me to remember what you told me 
 Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly? 
 Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me 
 Whoever don't feel him, feel balls like a goalie 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 One for the money, two for the better green 
 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
 Told the knock-kneed ghetto queen, "Get the head fiend" 
 Tell him it's for Medellin and use oxyacetylene 
 Who needs airplay? It's all just hearsay 
 Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day 
 Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret 
 He said Shasta and turned to formaldehyde faster 
 When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily 
 One night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele 
 Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat 
 With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat 
  
 [Chorus] 
 They better have my scrilla 
 Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly 
 Remind me to remember what you told me 
 Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly? 
 Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me[Intro: MF DOOM] 
 Mmm, Ladies 
 My favorite ladies 
  
 [Verse: MF DOOM] 
 Mary, you make me wanna eat you 
 Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you 
 Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too 
 Seductive and whatever, it might as well be seafood 
 Like my genie in a bottle 
 Miss could get me rich like a magazine-y model 
 Before you know it, he have her on a stroll 
 Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold 
 If I had to guess, just right, not a day old 
 Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load (trailer load) 
 Know the right number, you can get her 
 And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like 
 Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry 
 Just be cute, and don't worry 
 Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it 
 Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it (Ally) 
  
 Unlike Ally (sometimes she gets bitter) 
 Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her 
 She used to let me use her, back when I was looser 
 Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her 
 I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me 
 I probably could've been, if I'd never meet Evie 
 She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco 
 You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though 
  
 Kept a shorty, man, find 'em much thinner 
 If caught, I get mad time just for touching her 
 Knock wood, so much for hymens 
 So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds 
 Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing 
 At times she would play hard to get, fronting 
 Or something, she made me feel like the number one king 
 Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling 
 Met her out in Central Park--that's one sign 
 Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine 
 She said "you need to stop messing with that white girl 
 She fucking with your head and got your heart in a tight curl" (cookie) 
 We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me 
 She helped me get money at the dunce price OT 
 Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish 
 Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish 
  
 And Miss Hazy, older woman, mature black 
 Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin towed back 
 All she want me to do is blaze it crazy 
 The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy 
 Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi 
 Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me 
 It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on 
 Ally is always there to help me get back on 
  
 [Outro: MF DOOM] 
 Mmm, Ladies 
 My favorite ladies[Intro Skit] 
 (Narrator): Running desperately low on food, they were forced to turn back 
 (Interjection): Well I'll be! 
 (Interjection 2): What's that villain doing? 
  
 (Voice 1): Princess, your voice sounds familiar 
 (Princess): Well it should. You see, DOOM wants me to marry him. But after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world, I despise him. He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even now 
  
 [Verse 1: Angelika/StaHHr] 
 Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill 
 Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills 
 All thirty three nerves controlling my curves 
 Common sense just swerved every time I got served 
 Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric 
 Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit 
 Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate 
 More ways and actions of a primate 
 Who by low and census coming faker than extensions 
 Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin' 
 Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see 
 Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality 
  
 [Hook: 4ize] 
 War wound, purple heart, love veteran 
 Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine 
 Anything just to forget the hurt 
 Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt 
 On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind 
 And the POW's get left behind 
 Mentally scarred for life, love is war 
 And some chicks are just too hard to wife 
  
 [Verse 2: Angelika/StaHHr] 
 I shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin' the Guinnesses 
 Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling 
 He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling 
 So deep all in, I bet he never stop balling women 
 Forsake God for the scent of a man 
 Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand? 
 Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment 
 Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it 
 Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke 
 Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats 
 Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope? 
 Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope 
  
 [Hook: 4ize] 
 War wound, purple heart, love veteran 
 Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine

 On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind 
 And the POW's get left behind 
 Mentally scarred for life, love is war 
 And some chicks are just too hard to wife 
  
 [Verse 3: Angelika/StaHHr] 
 Constant frustration, stemming from a no-win situation 
 Rushing lust and fornication adding to the complication 
 Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you 
 Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline 
 Simpleton, life should really be a piece of Entenmann’s 
 Relationships strengthening, flower essence: Penstemon 
 Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I've never forsaken it 
 I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it 
 Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate, intense 
 Incense candles lit, scandalous 
 Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this? 
 Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous

 [Outro Skit] 
 (Interjection): Oh boy here we go! 
 (Voice): How come all you college boys wear them faggotty-looking white shoes, the look funny as hell. Ah looks like she got burnt laces 
  
 (Bert): You didn't wash your neck. Sometimes we don't wash our necks, but that's ok 
 (Ernie): Oh I washed my neck. Take-take a look at my neck 
  
 (Misc. Voice): Hold it right there you! 
 (DOOM): Where you are going, there are no jokes 
  
 (Spiderman): I'm beginning to think that armor plated Gargoyle doesn't like me[Intro] 
 If you're waiting for a parade there ain't none 
 Sharpen up your spirit of adventure 
 The fabulous gay way 
 Hey what's the big idea 
 Yeah 
 I have no ideas, in fact I'm quite bewildered 
 Now don't get gay with me 
 Gay, sir 
 I'm far from gay 
 Now listen and keep your shirt on 
 Grown men in a rubber suit 
 Runnin' around with a young boy 
 Homo 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Oh shoot, get a load of that fruit 
 In thigh-high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit 
 Holy homos 
 Even the rats know it’s tacky 
 'You ever see me slippin' like that bitch, just smack me' 
 Posin' Chester, legs open, couldn’t stand worse 
 All was missin' was a bandana and a man purse 
 Cryin', dyin', laughin' til glands burst 
 Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first 
 Fixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl 
 Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl 
 The things some people‘ll do for fame 
 It’s an herb, it’s a lame 
 It’s... a Goddamn shame 
 Villain willing when them cold streets call 
 You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs 
 Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty 
 He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry 
 Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley 
 Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy 
 At least monetarily terribly 
 MC's need therapy, it’s like a fairy spree 
 Hit him with a kryptonite brick 
 Children come and prick his dead body with a stick 
 Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick 
 She had the tightest grip around the head of my 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 ...Bic, now can I get my pen back 
 Got no enemy, got no friend, black 
 With the Green Goblin got the Batcave robbed 
 Bust in Batman’s head bobbin’, slobbin’ Robin’s knob 
 Y’all already got your belts on the floor so 
 Kick them shits over here and click off the porno 
 Alfred come home and found them both naked 
 Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected 
 Red and chrome Batmobile, wheelin‘ and dealin’ 
 Aquaman's sleepin' with the fishes, for real for squealin’ 
 Pss the lo-lo on a seal skin blazer 
 It’s just a little graze from a razor-thin laser 
 Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players 
 Showin' off they titballs to all the free-gayers 
 It’s like a leotard fest 
 How it got started is any retards guess 
 Regardless, that’s they choice, no hate debate 
 Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight 
 And raise the monster rate in the whole population 
 It’s starting to affect the super pimpin’ occupation 
 Now, who’s the hater, headline the newspaper 
 Fate of a fake you out caped crusader 
 Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail 
 Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail 
 The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male 
 Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale 
 Told ‘em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt 
 Did it like the dirty drawls 
 Wet ‘em up and air it out 
  
 [Outro] 
 You got any money 
 What 
 You got any money 
 Man you gone crazy 
 Damn 
 Batman's gay 
 Bhati boys[Intro: MF DOOM & MF Grimm] 
 You know when you're gonna come in? 
 Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know 
 Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit! 
 Niggas'll never run out of shit! 
 So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit... 
 It's another roller coaster ride 
  
 [Verse 1: MF Grimm] 
 Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes 
 The mind teases reality, crack the pieces 
 Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize 
 Guys revise, acknowledge past lives 
 Statements will be made, acknowledge me (Acknowledge me) 
 My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me (Enter me) 
 My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee (Try to flee) 
 Both gates look the same, which will it be? 
 Demons scream from thought process 
 Enter semen, child born, stress 
 Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest 
 Measure pleasure through financial progress 
 When it come to currency, love is nonexistent 
 Foes multiply, friends become so distant 
 Some hope you die, backstab in an instant 
 Foes I despise, disguised as allies 
 To sabotage, camouflage 
 Loyalty is lies 
 To see God, look into my eyes 
 To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes 
 (As I rise from Hell's equator...) 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up 
 Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
 Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up 
 Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
  
 [Verse 2: MF Grimm] 
 Take air, compress it, bless it 
 Mix loops like Ku Klux 
 MF don't give two fucks 
 Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble 
 Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles 
 This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble 
 Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys 
 Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby 
 Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi 
 Greatest of all time, God straight up told me 
 Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me 
 Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly 
 Prophets be phony 
 And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol 
 Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple 
 Pick niggas off while they ballin' 
 And die old like Stalin 
 Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect 
 Human sacrifice, must pay respect 
 We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck 
 And... we gonna... gonna... 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up 
 Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
 Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up 
 Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

 Boom 
 MF Grimm, MF DOOM[Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Intro: MF DOOM + sample] 
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen 
 ("Hey!") 
 I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening 
 Let me know if y'all with me, y'all 
 ("Hey!") 
 Just a couple of things I wanna say 
  
 [Verse] 
 I only play the games that I win at 
 And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats 
 As a matter of fact, let me rephrase: 
 With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days 
 Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian 
 He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin' 
 Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that 
 Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat 
 Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose? 
 And holds mics like he knows karate body blows? 
 Nobody knows the trouble I see 
 From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the eye bubble eye thirty 
 For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all 
 Science fiction that's not admissible ("Hey!") in no court of law 
 I live to rock mics 3-D 
 The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV 
 I heard beats, they sound like karaoke 
 With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me 
 Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts 
 And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts 
 They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven 
 Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven 
 Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint 
 Call me Mista Bent 
 I'm at where your sister went 
 Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke 
 Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—("Hey!") 
 —tell a joke 
 This could lead to catastrophe 
 'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three 
 Shots from the black bat got me at headlock 
 Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock 
 She told me, "Get off," I said, "Bitch! 
 Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick" 
 Then it hit me like the point of intoxication 
 Nigga, come out and rock this nation like ("Hey!") ox defacin' 
 A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation 
 In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation 
 But you could do it, you the Super like in your building 
 Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children 
 Plottin' and it sure to pay ends 
 With some real mature womens, and more of they friends ("Hey!") 
 And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true 
 Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue 
 Who grip necks of Becks to triple X? 
 He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects 
 And it'll lead you right to him 
 Oh, snap! 
 It seems you walked into a trap, through rap 
 Zoinks! 
 This place is filled with pretender willies 
 One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies 
 True believers 
 Ain't nothin new to a 
 Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh- 
 Rhyme of the month two page long 
 Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong 
 Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song 
 With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong 
 Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! ("Hey!") 
 National and geographic down to the titty-bar 
 Rep Monster Island City, y'all! 
 To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids 
 You could have got away with it if it was not for them 
 Meddlin' kids! 
 ("Over here!") 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 "Hey!" 
 "Hey!"[Verse 1] 
 I remember when, last past November when 
 Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands 
 They left him trembling, he was not remembering: 
 Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem 
 Some would debate, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin 
 Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him" 
 When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling 
 Us to break them off, no reassembling 
 No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to 
 Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do 
 You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse 
 Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts 
 Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails 
 All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail 
 700 volts holds rap to a standstill 
 Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed 
 Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled 
 And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill 
 And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze 
 (And the lights went down and hey!) 
  
 [Hook] 
 And I knew it was the last day - Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason 
 Mostly with these crimes of treason 
 And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick 
 He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick 
 He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back 
 Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack 
 It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple 
 Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple 
 'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle 
 Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self 
 Ain't no average MC ahead of me 
 Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree 
 With nicknames, sick games as Rick James 
 Messy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James 
 Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker 
 Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker 
 Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up 
 Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up 
 My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May 
 To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday 
 All else? Worthless to say 
 (And the lights went down and hey!) 
  
 [Hook] 
 That's when I knew it was the first day - Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning 
 Mostly with these crimes of treason men 
 And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act 
 I been bent back since my Physical went back 
 Since, Cultured more of my kin 
 And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole 
 Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold 
 In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold 
 To 'round Nimrod release day 
 And all else? Needless to say 
 Wait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented 
 The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it 
 The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted 
 The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted 
  
 [Hook] 
 Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning 
 Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating 
 All types of different styles of treason[Intro: Charles Bukowski] 
 Born like this, into this 
 As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs 
 As political landscapes dissolve 
 As the oily fish spit out their oily prey 
 We are born like this, into this 
 Into hospitals that are too expensive that it is cheaper to die 
 Into lawyers who charged so much that it is cheaper to plead guilty 
 Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed 
 Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes 
 Born into this, walking and living through this, dying because of this 
 Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this 
 The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God 
 The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder 
 We are born into this sorrowful deadliness 
 There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets 
 It will be guns and roving mobs 
 Land will be useless 
 Food will become a diminishing return 
 Nuclear power will be taken over by the many 
 Explosions will continually shape the earth 
 Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men 
 The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind 
 And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard 
 Born out of that 
 The sun hidden there 
 Awaiting the next chapter 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 DOOM from the realm of El Kulum smelly gel fume 
 Separating cell womb to Melle Mel boom 
 Revelations in Braille respiration inhale view 
 Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due 
 Blazing swords trace the haze praise the Lord 
 Saving Grace, lace your broad she say she bored 
 A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin 
 Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison 
 A Bad Samaritan averaging above average men 
 Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging 
 For scraps, perhaps road kill if that 
 Gift of gab and he flowed ill chrome stiff hat 
 Known for writing lightning tight lines 
 Chief and beefing being off deep ends divine bright shines even 
 Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine 
 Slight rewind tightly bind blind lead blind 
 Need mines now that was this is then, listening 
 To sizzling officialtons whispering, "Him again" 
 Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money 
 Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny 
 Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet 
 Save your breath gave a F pay your debt they forget 
 Make her sweat bullets crime pays no benefits 
 Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates 
  
 [Interlude: Sample] 
 "Three thousand years ago Moses said 
 Every human being is responsible for his actions 
 Or thy being is still thy beast, not yet human!" 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 You ought to let your uncle flow my motorcyle trunk fulls 
 From 2 1 2 1 lose crumbs to trunks in bundles 
 Hands down, better than what your mans use to get 
 Standing around from where the translucent looses spit 
 Missing wheel you don't listen you're a feel head 
 Sitting in the kitchen pissing twitching kissing steel lead 
 Crime pays no dental nor medical 
 Unless you catch some time in county, state or federal 
 You heard like roaring waters in a seashell 
 If a tree fell you couldn't tell from 3 cell 
 Be real careful, they tell him by the earful 
 Kids doing skid bids acting out is terrible 
 Word is bond, fix your clothes put a shirt on 
 Pants sagging back when you use to meant you had a skirt on 
 Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers 
 El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers 
 Motherfuckers 
  
 (Voice) 
 DOOM is transmitting a message to you 
 Super fools 
 I need to use more power[Intro: MF Doom] 
 As the life cycle goes on ... goes on 
 And you learn to hold on (hold on) 
 To things like the mic ... the mic 
 And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device 
 But who is (The finest) 
  
 [Verse 1: Tommy Gunn + MF Doom] 
 Tommy Tashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor 
 Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor 
 Tommy Tashuma, no time for humor 
 As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas 
 Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already 
 Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather 
 We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it? 
 You know it like a poet, my brother 
 Hey, Gunn you wit it? Whatever... [the finest!] 
  
 [Verse 2: MF Doom] 
 I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off 
 To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off" 
 Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off 
 A show-off, he has the same bike Puff fell off 
 I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts 
 Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks 
 Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell 
 The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell 
  
 [Verse 3: Tommy Gunn] 
 When die, he gon' die like a soldier die: 
 Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold 
 Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach 
 Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die 
 He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky 
  
 [Verse 4: MF Doom] 
 Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup 
 This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up 
 I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up 
 Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up 
  
 [Verse 5: Megalon] 
 Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die 
 He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes 
 Got the weed, rolling lah 
 Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply 
 Within the prophecies hold the lie 
  
 [Verse 6: MF Doom] 
 He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me, OD 
 Ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me 
 A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed me 
 Sci-Fly, whole style stuck up 
 Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!" 
 Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough 
 He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed" 
 Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it -- 
 We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit" 
 Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance 
 For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor 
  
 [Verse 7: Megalon + MF Doom] 
 I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what? 
 Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up 
 On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up 
 Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete 
 Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already 
 Can't stand you, understand you deadly 
 But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy 
 Yo' Doom, you ready? 
 Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it? 
 Whatever 
  
 [Verse 8: MF Doom] 
 Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day 
 Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!" 
 Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes 
 Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's 
 Metal grill, with many styles, better still 
 Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel 
 And deal, and run rings around rhymers 
 And run rings like number runners whose old-timers 
  
 [Verse 9: Megalon] 
 Shorty in the all black, she think she all that 
 I called her, she said, "Don't call back!" 
 She called me, now what you call that? 
 Let's go back, I sold crack 
 Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that 
 Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at? 
  
 [Verse 10: MF Doom] 
 Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash 
 He love her, motherfuck her ass 
 Metal feet dented your car fender 
 My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender 
 Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown? 
 MF like Mike Fran Corleone 
 And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at? 
 An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act 
 Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback 
 Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act) 
 (Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback) 
 (Fuck with me I'll be back) 
 Like niggas in the streets act (streets act!) 
  
 [Outro: Sample] 
 Of black misery 
 The finest[Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Goddamn it 
 Super motherfucking villain goddamn it 
 About to get these millions, stacks and shit 
 Yo, his dip tried to tell him 
 Ooh, you're like the sun 
 Chasing all of the rain away 
 When you come around, you bring brighter days 
 She told him 
 You're the perfect one 
 For me and you forever will be 
 He told her 
 I will rock this microphone ... always! 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight 
 But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white 
 The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it 
 To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick 
 When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick 
 At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you 
 Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper 
 Called back my secretary gatekeeper 
 Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though 
 You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho" 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 I had this style ever since I was a child 
 I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes 
 Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance 
 Emcees whose styles need Velamints 
 And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's 
 The Super motherfucking Villain, nigga came through raw like the elements 
 On 99 plus one of them 
 And with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him 
 When we with y'all, we had tons of fun 
 Me and my duns and them 
 Actual true and living sons of them 
 Dead planets and God-U's 
 Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's 
 Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit 
 Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits 
 Scientific going berserk like Red Alert 
 I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt 
 To fund these experiments is where I went 
 Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent 
 To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do 
 Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?) 
 Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions 
 From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions 
 That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible 
 Them's not ready yet for the incredible 
 Team of MC's who broke all fakes 
 Who thought they were slaughter proof 
  
 [Outro] 
 Stomping through like North Face waterproof 
 Tat-tat, that's the end of that 
 After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at 
 I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of 
 Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...Zev Love X (1988 ~ 1993)Villain's first step into the spotlight was under his nickname 'Zev Love X' at the age of 17. He was part of the group KMD with his younger brother (DJ Subroc)  and third member Rodan, who was later replaced by Onyx the Birthstone Kid. After his brother DJ Subroc's death and the group was dropped from their label, DOOM went off the grid for half a decade. 
  
 During his time with KMD DOOM didn't wear anything to hide his face from the public. Unless you count cap and his glasses of course... 
 Pre-MF DOOM (1997 ~ 1999)"Dumile began freestyling incognito at open-mic events at the Nuyorican Poets Café in Manhattan, obscuring his face by putting a women's stocking over his head." 
 - Wikipedia 
 Before even picking up the identity of MF DOOM, Dumile had already made the decision to cover up his face when he returned to the hip-hop scene. The quote above states he was wearing women's stockings over his face while 'KEO', who worked with DOOM on his first 2 masks, has stated he also wore a bandana over his face to conceal his identity. No real pictures of this era are spread publicly. 
 Prototype DOOM mask (1999)Worn in videoclips from the 'Operation: Doomsday' album; for instance in '?'  & 'Dead Bent' 
  
 Dumile took on the identity of MF DOOM, based of Marvel villain Doctor Doom, and started with wearing a 'real' mask instead of stockings or a bandana. 
  
 "He cleans his metal mask with gasoline" 
 - MF DOOM on '?' 
 By the time DOOM spitted the line above, his mask wasn't even made of real metal yet. It was still just a plastic altered WWF Kane mask, also known as 'prototype'. Cleaning his mask with gasoline is for that reason probably not a good idea. 
  
 Extra: Make your own MF DOOM prototype mask! ✂️ 
 Original DOOM mask (2000 ~ 2004)Worn on the album cover of Madvillainy, also in the music video's for this project and is the base for all further iterations. 
 "We went out and found the whole helmet from the movie 'Gladiator'" 
 ~ Blake 'KEO' Lethem 
 The first real iteration where the mask was made out of metal. This was made shortly after Operation: Doomsday as he was seen wearing this during his performances at this point in time. 
  
 This mask, which is basically just the face plate from a dissmantled roman helmet replica from the movie 'Gladiator' enriched with construction helmet webbing, is considered to be the face of MF DOOM ever since. 
 Original DOOM mask + Side spikes (2005 ~ 2010)Started to appear around the time DOOM collaborated with Danger Mouse as DANGERDOOM. 
  
 In 2004 DOOM was still seen with his original mask; for instance on the cover of 'Madvillainy'. 2005 was the year his album 'The Mouse and the Mask' came out. Even though the mask illustrated on the cover of this album doesn't have any side spikes, there are in fact pictures of the duo DANGERDOOM with these on the side of his face. 
  
 The overal aesthetics of the mask are identical to the original mask; only there are now two spikes located on each temperol bone. 
 Original DOOM mask + Jewel & Side spikes (2011 ~ 2014)Can be seen in the music videos for his collaboration with Jneiro Jarel, where he appears as part of JJ DOOM. Also worn during the RedBull Music academy interview which took place in Madrid, 2011. 
  
 It basically is identical to the original mask with the side spikes, The biggest change however is that this mask has a small mostly red jewel in between the eyebrow area. On some occassions the jewel was seen in other colors, for instance cyan blue. It also looks more chrome-ish since the mask reflects more light than the others normally did. 
 Golden DOOM mask (May 2014)First appeared in an announcement video DOOM made for 'Check the Rhyme' festival in France where he had a show. 
  
 This mask was the first iteration which changed the primary color of it, being gold instead of metallic/silver. Another unique detail about this mask is that appart from the earlier described masks there is a color difference in the hardware; The side spikes are still the chrome/silverish color while the rest of the mask is in fact gold. 
  
 Nehruvian DOOM mask (Oktober 2014)Started to appear around the time DOOM formed the duo NehruvianDoom with Bishop Nehru. 
  
 While wearing the golden mask on the NehruvianDoom album artwork, DOOM has been seen sporting a transparent red mask around Bishop Nehru. the same color difference, just like on the gold one, between the spikes and the rest of the mask is also featured on this iteration. A new unique feature which isn't been spotted on other variants but does appear on the Nehruvian DOOM mask is that the jewel inbetween the eyes seems to be missing, even though the socket for the jewel is there.[Verse: MF DOOM] 
 Big up all the Monsta Island massive 
 And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid 
 Who asked me what we don't got that you got son 
 For one flow that's elementary, my dear Watson 
 Secondly, ever since I was little 
 Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable 
 Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap 
 With no hands, I chopped these drums off, truly yours, G Rap 
 Actual fact, relax 
 In this land of lyrical lost, black, I'm not the cool sleestak 
 The one who might stop and talk to you 
 Poisoned a few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork too 
 Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly 
 When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry 
 So I ask why the styes from the cess 
 Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest 
 The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand 
 Throwing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan 
 It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying 
 Fronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying 
 Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first 
 Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you 
 With well refined rhymes like a editor 
 Throw them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator 
 Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) was Jet Jaguar and James Brown 
 (yeah yeah, only them two) 
 Ain't you glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true) 
 I'd like to say, "Hi, it's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin" 
 That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling 
 Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling 
 Who see God toke but never see God hurlin' 
 My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost 
 Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most 
 With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose 
 Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host 
 S to the U to the P E R-uh 
 Who chronicle these times in a 3D horror 
 Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama 
 Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower 
 Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows 
 Single-handedly with one eye closed 
 In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé 
 May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay 
 That's that n a smash way how he did it 
 Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute 
 Exquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow 
 That's how we do it though[Verse] 
 HMMMM 
 The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim 
 All big letters but isn't no acronym 
 Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking 
 DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken 
 Chrome grown man doing business with anglo-sax'n'them 
 Lacking swing but that banjo's so relaxing 
 As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind 
 Pretend it's just a pen, see if you can pencil 'em in 
 Tense, mention men of honor fenced in 
 Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end 
 Don't get keelhauled in 
 Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin 
 Not to call the whole crowd out 
 It's just a few chumps, and you know who you are like a shoutout 
 Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry 
 Waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully 
 Disappear, reappear and disappear again 
 Villain not his hair, he's no afro-american 
 If that's the case he be a bald-headed African 
 Taking all the credit and jetted, astro travelling 
 Turn a man into a mannequin for AFLAC'n 
 And being tough acting Tinactin bluff jacking 
 He wears a mask so when he dogs his face 
 Each and every race, could absorb the bass 
 In the place to be, don't believe the hyperbole 
 It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally 
 Or beat in the head with lead pipe languages 
 For street cred leave him for dead in anguishments 
 The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses 
 Who came to help the people with they minds and they asses 
 You set trip and get a grip like Spalding 
 These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskin"Things take a turn for the worse" 
 "Send him back where he came from" 
 "We got shots fired down the street" 
  
 [Doom] 
 Ba-di-yahhhh 
 Alright, steady 
 Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah 
  
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 If they get the Villain surrounded then {*AHEM*} 
  
 Good to the last drop niglets 
 Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets 
 Go for the bosses' dicks or higher 
 Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire 
 Get at the sarge, he give the orders 
 The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered 
 Use stealth, play alleys, jet 
 We'd rather not alert them nosy federalies yet 
 Keep the local random cases in each state 
 Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight 
 You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white 
 Anybody tell get lighted on sight 
 The ringer's on a need-to-know basis 
 No persons, places, things and no faces 
 Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone 
 Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone 
 It's a price on all snitches 
 If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures 
 Send copies to those who singin' the blues 
 Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused 
 Our species is in danger 
 Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger 
 That'll let them fools know 
 And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 Now you have your orders, do your duty 
 A new way to let the shots spray 
 A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte 
 No smell nor taste, hardly traceable 
 Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled 
 Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stretches 
 A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses 
 A fake judge with many years on the bench 
 That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench 
 They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched 
 The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench 
 And she was tortured, some say post-mortem 
 The suspect took his own life before they caught him 
 It's real spooky like a real trife movie 
 Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit 
 Shed blood, some'll be shooken 
 Just look with they head in the mud, red flood 
  
 "Villain" 
  
 [Outro] 
 One of the things we ran into the unknown 
 We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to 
 And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door 
 There's a man trapped inside of it 
 Basically that man trap is a cage 
 'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us 
 While we're just, we're stuck in a cage[Part I]

 Oh, oooh 
 Nah, dude—change that beat 
 That's a'ight, but—the other shit—other shit was iller 
  
 [Part II] 
  
 [Intro] 
 Word, word 
 Yeah, that shit is dope right there 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 A modern day marvel, but terrible—better—horrible 
 When he grab the mic from son, he crushed up all his metacarpals 
 He said he ain't mean it—totally by accident 
 After the show, he didn't follow where y'all taxi went 
 Will this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill 
 They on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill 
 But will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant 
 And super like 1-A, have a fun stay 
 One day, he plan to put in a runway 
 With enough land for his own projects and gun play 
 Section 8 penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway 
 Alotta y'all ass out like gay runaways 
 It's how they say "semi-risque" 
 All day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way 
 Have the average MC say, "Gimme a sick day!" 
 They really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh 
 Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch 
 In school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch 
 Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit 
 He writ this skit in Sanskrit 
 If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low 
 Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though 
 It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow 
 Tucked-in Le Tigre—just let the name-buckle show 
  
 [Part III] 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Good googly moogly—see that loogie? 
 Yeah—but keep it on the D.L. Hughley 
 You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie 
 Just to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*—Mitsurugi 
 Gooey gum drops—who he got his style from? 
 —his pops—you gotta give the bum some props 
 Ask ya sister—her beat box is more-thicker 
 DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor 
  
 [Part IV] 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Villain for hire—admire the sound 
 Make sure the price is right before he come on down! 
 Rappers be on some "You, you, you!" 
 Forgot who they talking too, too much pork stew 
 They need to not come out with nothing new 
 Blew the whole shit up on some "What this button do?" 
 Doom cheat the game like walk-thru 
 Run 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo 
 The way alotta clowns get down is unnatural 
 This flow flip like oranges, apples 
 Rhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple 
 Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple 
 First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone 
 Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on 
 In came the Villain with their own gear like, "Hi, there 
 Y'all play the rear, this whole year—my year." 
 Metal face beard like Brillo pad 
 Y'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad 
 Seed call him, "Ol' dad," the one the ol' ho had 
 Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads 
 Okay pal, pay him like Paypal 
 So we could be A-OK not OK Corral 
 I think today I'll make the ladies say, "Ow" 
 And maybe fuck around take a bow, now 
  
 [Part V] 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades 
 Used to be straight A's and still made the grade 
 'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast? 
 Year after last, left back in the retarded class 
 Shoulda went to Boces 
 Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be 
 Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent 
 Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent 
 Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo 
 You got another one?

 [Intro: Megalon] 
 Who you think I am, but who you want me to be? 
  
 [Verse 1: King Ceasar] 
 When I rock, jock niggas in shellshock 
 Don't watch the birdie watch the clock go tick tock 
 I rip shop, I make ya girls bottom lip drop 
 Yo word to the truckers at the pit stop I'm hip hop 
 I hold heat, never forget what niggas told me, they showed me 
 Other emcees trying to fold, me they owe me 
 Yo, plus them niggas mad slow G 
 I got my "Get U Now," so I'm comin with my homie 
 Here's the plan; stick 'em up, I enter, through the window 
 Stoop down so we can't see our crescendo 
 Pass the indo, yo we used to be our friend though 
 Yeah but thats the reason I don't really like to lend dough 
  
 [Verse 2: Rodan] 
 From the corners cylindrical triangle hats 
 Says dunce. Lyrics precise like forensical science leave you entangled for months 
 Tryin' to figure who done it, you fronted 
 Got cha shit stunted, didn't have to be that way 
 Some saw the light comin' in, they shunned it 
 For the wickedness to those whose despise life and worship death 
 The established matched at eye for eye, tooth for tooth, breath to breath 
 These are the last days of the countdown, shit is just that drastic 
 Write journals, like they use the prophets, study math like a Aztec 
  
 [Verse 3: Megalon] 
 Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be 
 A true thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached 
 I wanna give you my slugs and don't wanna take em 
 Box sprays, but with my box cutter in my boxes 
 Shots sprayed, who on cops high says we rastas 
 Rock away boulevard, got love and obnoxious 
 Bout five cops today, my rock away 
 Niggas and rock rage, got paid 
 A rock, you know why I rock, meet me at the Lobster's 
 I suggest I should dress proper 
 Copped a buzz, I copped a dutch 
 I got a lotta love, with no strings attached 
  
 [Verse 4: Kamackeris] 
 Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes, we got plenty 
 Dimes, dimes, dimes, too many 
 Sparked up and chat, you keep countin 
 I do my thing, jealous niggas keep doubtin 
 Rock 'n' roll, lock 'n' load 
 Emcees out for pots of gold, we stop 'em cold 
 In they tracks an take all they chips-eses 
 All they dats, all they bullshit mixeses 
 Give 'em a credit, not debt it 
 We just flipped the calistetic 
 Toss the Andy Pettitte, you said it 
 We grandslam in the never boss stand 
 Any pussy emcee's we abandon 
  
 [Verse 5: King Geedorah] 
 Flew in from Monster Island just to rag shit wit jet lag 
 With brothers specializin ways how us not to get bagged 
 Egads! I bring confusion like roll call 
 To emcees so-called, hoes be like "yup I told y'all" 
 So socialize my bio so I dip dip dive 
 Memorize like I-omega zip drive 
 Go to the bar to drink to get soberer 
 King Ghidra eat the head of a king cobra like ginkoba 
  
 [Verse 6: Kong] 
 Kong get a cut like Kobe, now hold heat 
 So sweet, roll deep but no beef 
 Those that doze deep, close sheets 
 Po chose to speak with, reach over to reload the piece 
 Slip from freak to deak, keep concrete 
 Parallel to body til the next male 
 Shotties and hotty, still waitin to exhale 
 Smell the blood bath a slug's caught 
 Slugs passed and bloodsport 
 Bugged laugh, a bugged thought 
 Caught some eyes make the case last stack a locker 
 Bocker, drink a vodka, hit note, like Sinatra at a opera 
 Drop a flocker, Orville Redenbacher 
 Get you, got you, shot the two L's without the proper 
 For the albums knocker 
 Hit the liquor, quicker than a quicker picker upper 
 Girl and stick er, I leave more nuts than a snicker 
 Kick er to the curb, punk a bitch, stomp a chick 
 For now call me Kong, Monster Isle, Monster Click (Bow!) 
  
 [Outro: Megalon] 
 Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be 
 True thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached 
 I wanna give you my slugs, and don't wanna take 'em back[Verse] 
 Chain-smoking beedies 'til his brain's broken completely 
 Get back on his feet, work out and eat some Wheaties 
 Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom 
 Had him in the cobra clutch when he spat the mad hymn 
 Gems, collection of *brrrrrrat*'s, Timbs and hats 
 Had no time for the pitty-pat, I'll give him that 
 The rhythm hit him back with a right hook 
 Shook it off, caught a shiner, thought it was an aight look 
 Depends on the shades, the end of days fades 
 Pretenders lay in dazes on stages, Du-malaise 
 Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise 
 His own way was strange but it matters not 
 Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock 
 Hold it down like Shatner do Spock 
 Rapper jocks need to put a sock their chatterbox 
 The block got light of Vioxx stock 
 Folks gather round, it's no joke like "Knock, knock" 
 It's them, they came home to roost y'all 
 And watch 'em transform the game to the rules of foosball 
 She's too small, any questions? 
 Him could squeeze blood from a penny in the recession 
 Keep guessing, it gets deeper than depression 
 The power of suggestion wake a sleeper, peep the lesson 
 Dig that beat 
 Ripped it with Metal Fingers and stomped it with big fat feet 
 And you know what they say, cut the hay 
 Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated 
 But today it's all grey metallic with a ruby stone 
 Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on 
 Hardcore porn, did his own stunts 
 Writ his own rhymes and split his own blunts 
 Once in a while, every other minute 
 Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach 
 Steady on his business and ready with an ill pitch 
 Keeps a bad bilznitch like Denny Kucimilznitch 
 No hitch, just a shit-load of spit and sneeze 
 Strictly G stacking up off a rack of hidden fees 
 Rap is like the gay club strip tease 
 With hippies on the yip saying "Hey bub, grip these" 
 They screaming for attention 
 Beaming at the mention of a scary demon convention 
 You could cut the tension with a switchblade 
 And serve it on the same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made 
 Filleted, persuaded the chambermaid 
 To bet her paycheck on a get-naked game of spades 
 Straight up, no chaser, no layaways 
 Caution, faint taste of microwave mayonnaise 
  
 "Doom has taken over every continent"[Intro: Ghostface Killah] 
 Yea, that's right 
 It's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither 
 This is real shit 
 This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all 
 No doubt, 7 o'clock Fantasy Island 
 This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn Man" 
 This is Tony's Angels 
  
 [Verse 1: Ghostface Killah] 
 It was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks 
 Undercover agents, far beyond narcs 
 Amazed by their beauty marks, Wonder Woman bracelets 
 Knee-high boots that was made by Clarks 
 My dick got hard at how they spoke and shit 
 Every language was music to the kid as if 
 I was modern day King Midas, Doreen, Skye and Kelly 
 Starky's Angels, Shaolin's finest 
 Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn 
 Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was woofin' 
 My Angels jetted out of Albee Square 
 Gun out, wrap in their hair, kinda crowded so they clap in the air 
 Chased a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks 
 These mommies real angels took one off his top 
 He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar 
 The more they ran the more their skirts got dirtier 
 Sending shots like check day, Fed Ex expressway 
 Boom bow bing, you heard the gunplay 
 "Who shot that duck out the window", Mr. Lee said 
 "Three pay now, you fucking weed head" 
 We can stop the finest suspect, he's dead 
 Then I pulled up, "Come on girls to Club Med" 
  
 [Interlude: MF DOOM] 
 Stay tuned for the conclusion 
 Three's Company Family Jewels 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM 
 He woke up stoked like they was still in the room 
 Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep 
 Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet 
 Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked 
 Threw on the boxers, searching for the Treo 
 Checkin' for the keys, the dough 
 A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing 
 Recollected now why Hollywood hotties stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti's 
 Personnel nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shottie 
 Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas 
 She drive while nice to veggie fried rice spicy 
 Told them both, I don't feel so well, my belly 
 Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly 
 Y'all go head and get the dutches, be back copy 
 Feeling woozy, no uzi, who's he see in the lobby 
 Peace, Peace, pizza man, change a hundred, stopped and looked 
 Whoops, left the knot in her pocket book 
 Wasn't the juks but too careless fearless 
 Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace 
 The question remains who bound and gagged him 
 That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum 
 Villains skied a gram on the street, fifty G 
 The part of Mr. Roper was played by Mr. T[Hook: Pebbles the Invisible Girl] 
 Feel the magnetism between us (The mic) 
 Growing stronger and stronger (The mic) 
 Why don't we do it? (The mic) 
  
 [MF Doom] 
 I was in a case out of state 
 She was thirteen and good, we had a hotter date 
 It was just a number, she never told she was knocked up 
 By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up 
 My aunt came and got me, and steadied the block 
 We bounced to the yeti, and I'm ready to rock 
 With no attachments, feelin a little loose 
 Blowin up in every spot, we had a little juice 
 Probably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me 
 We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly... 
 Who tapped me? I'm bout to get real ill 
 Already ripped the whole club with Metal Face's steel wheel 
 What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes 
 And fine, she pulled me to the sidelines 
 The mystery shot up with strong words 
 She was an intelligent wisdom and a songbird 
 I met her last week at the same place 
 She stepped to me, the same way at a no shame pace 
 I'm off guard, her game had me choked up 
 Checkin me, play testin me, till I spoked up 
 Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (not a word) 
 I was worried, I thought I woulda heard from 
 Stranger, you know I never get enough of you 
 How you be comin through... 
 Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three 
 In my earlier days they showed me things new to me 
 So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off 
 They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off 
 When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her 
 Switchin off three times a night made them more opener 
 So you could love Allah, or leave him the hell alone 
 Message from my godfather, solid gold telephone 
 Many of my men went up in smoke 
 While trickin with these chickens, and ended up broke 
 You find out who's ya mans when you broke 
 Like a bad joke, it's funny, when you on you got mad folk 
 I played the middle man in every little scam 
 Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam 
 I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers 
 Walk upon me speaking with they stinkin mouth (About what?) 
 About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats 
 Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps 
 And it's that cool the dice at that 
 I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat 
 I play the back, steady on the humble 
 But be right up front when we get ready to rumble 
 I gave her breath control, ask her who she learned off 
 Coulda took her back to the crib, somehow was turned off 
 Me and you... was overdue 
 From gettin together baby 
 I always knew our love was meant to be 
  
 Feel the magnetism between us (The Mic) 
 Growing stronger and stronger (The Mic) 
 Why don't we do it[Verse] 
 More rhymin', pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing 
 Raw lining, Paul Simon touring, I'm in 
 Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hype men 
 Excited writing, trifling times ten 
 Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way 
 On the interstate, integrate all day 
 It's just a small phase, that's what them all say 
 Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway 
 Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies 
 Remember these intentionally, empathy please 
 Silent moment, violent prone atonement 
 Miles a minute on a microphone, own rent, loan spent 
 No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet 
 Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last 
 Not least, pass the pot of hot grease 
 Geese shot, not easily spotted plot, cease snot release 
 Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well 
 Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail 
 Get the message by bird mail or turds flail 
 Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail 
 An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies 
 Before she look, he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties 
 Or plan B, when in Rome go back home 
 And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome 
 He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on 
 The black-McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon 
 Gone wrong on the song, who's zooming who? 
 Knew it was you DOOM all along 
 Ever since he first started the art, it's been worth it 
 Soon to charter a stint on part of the Chitlin' Circuit 
 Word kid, get your ticket from the telepath 
 "Wicked, wicked, wicked" on electroencephalograph

 Never understand what people's heads are in 
 Ask me what I need 
  
 [King Ghidra] 
 A fly tramp, that's what she called me 
 Cause I don't wear no Stetson hats like Paul C 
 As y'all see, who give a fuck? Who know what is it? 
 These styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite 
 It's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL 
 Looked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... "Well! 
 I know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs" 
 As I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea 
 She said, "The one with the horse weave? The pretty one? 
 All crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve 
 Which one you want?" I'm like, "If there was comp? 
 Fuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!" 
 King Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy 
 Probably have moved since last y'all saw me 
 On the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin 
 In they Polo, Nautica, or DK men 
  
 Amen! It's funny how significance make a difference 
 Notice parables of three in every other inference 
 For instance: "Who wanna battle? On the real? 
 Choose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel" 
 I own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt 
 I'd like to give a extra special out to Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star 
 The Monster Island Czars - y'all know who you are 
 Get that!

 Coming straight from the black lungs 
 I rip tracks for all players that pack guns 
 Stack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs 
 To my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up 
 Y'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, "What?" 
 Like they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers 
 I'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po 
 If they catch us and try to push us 
 Since when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit? 
 I be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch! 
  
 [King Ghidra] 
 What a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella 
 I came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller 
 If I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella 
 Or either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla 
 Though y'all know he don't play, right? 
 TNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight 
 And he was shackled by hands and feet 
 Then they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete 
 Near the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street 
 Where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat 
 I'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay 
 Only TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway 
 With Mary Jane and Ginger 
 Oh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja 
 When the mack is bent, who can give one fuck? 
 Get bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks 
 Y'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece 
 Three-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease 
  
 (Get that money, god) 
  
 Sick to they head-piece

 What is the magic that makes one's eyes 
 Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies 
 The name of the game is lightworks 
  
 I see you're peein' in your pants little sissy boy 
  
 [DOOM] 
 Jerks... 
 Welcome to the Octagon 
 Lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on 
 Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon 
 With hard rock Black, Rock & Ron's goin' Barbizon 
 Curled up beggin, layin on the canvas 
 Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis 
 Scissors, Lanvis, grand fist sandwich, stance switch 
 Slammed on, stitches twitch, hands itch, damn snitch 
 Any street corner could be the platform till we defeat gone and wander 
 Watch your mouth jaw, southpaw, outs floor 
 Doubt your clout more, bout roar, outscore boy 
 Off the leash like UFC 
 Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties 
 FUB's, heffer please, lost a few to stew beef 
 New referees, what a remarkable team, show your teeth 
  
 [Hook] 
 The shine that sparkles and gleams 
 Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks 
 Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks 
  
 Wipe off slight smirks 
 The match was mapped out 
 Get jabbed and crap-slapped out, tapped out 
 Either the lunch bin or choke hold time 
 Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme

 The shine that sparkles and gleams 
 Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks 
  
 Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks 
  
 [Outro] 
 The right hurtsTo my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron 
 Who been in to win and blast to the last siren 
 On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick 
 Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic 
 Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees? 
 Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's 
 If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky 
 At your local sleazy speakeasy 
 For any fan of the limelight 
 In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite 
 It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale 
 With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail 
 Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that? 
 Who cats who do magic like "Tell me how you do's that" 
 Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko 
 Thought I might do techno 
 Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the vet 
 For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's 
 Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter 
 Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter 
 But uh... word play since third grade age 
 Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage" 
 Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight 
 Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate 
 My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring 
 Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing 
 Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting 
 Then the super-villain struck again like lightning 
 In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that? 
 And a name drop like pick the name out the hat 
 That's a known drop from the, liver conniver 
 Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I 
 Drop degrees like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed 
 So way back spin your back and then freeze 
 While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero 
 So called rhymers, go call Cleo 
 While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin" 
 Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen 
 Sometimes the men, mostly from the women 
 I hear voices saying that's the super-villain 
 (Uhh, I hear voices) 
 Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villainLive! In stereo 
  
 [Intro: Raekwon] 
 Yessir! This what I wanna hear my nigga, yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 You don't even know that's the official word up in the town 
 You heard? Ha ha ha 
 Get that swing, yessir! Get it in man 
 That's the official shit kid, mmhmm 
 Word up, we gon' take it back to the big park 'n shit 
 Yeah, when niggas was rhymin hard and comin crazy 
 Electrifying and vivid, yo 
  
 [Verse: Raekwon] 
 I'm like a rabbi, fresh new mag and I'm mad high 
 Stolen black Jag I brag fly, yeah 
 Yo a project thug, political gangster, starving Langston Hughes 
 The Jews want the crib when the God dies 
 I'm deadly, metaphors'll dog you while I'm in the Forbes 
 First 500 niggas who raw live 
 Yo B, the nigga Shallah, he low-key 
 But he O.G., half of his niggas gone or in hidin 
 Federallis'll sneak, police, holdin my old piece 
 Heard the young policeman died 
 58 carats of glass, the Aston—blueberry black 
 Where I keep my ices and knives at 
 One of the force rawest, yo we're British aware 
 Who get money shoot dice in his fortress 
 Mocknecks and stragglers, eightball jackets the hagglers 
 Of the rap game, post up surprise 
 I want that spot, coolin with the Supervillain team 
 All you other playboys is twats 
 Niggas be down for the murder game 
 Run in the church, grab the rifle, put one in a nigga frame 
 I'm thirsty, hungry like a Somalian 
 Polly with them niggas with the waves in they dome like tsunami 
 All we do is get fresh and fuck ma 
 Probably yo' baby ma gave me head in Barney's while I calmly 
 And I got giants in armies 
 While we rock mean colored clothes and don divas 
 Yeah Chef back, some call him Louis Smith 
 Slash Lex Diamond and his chick sell crack 
 We rep bananas, beat this, legend of Stan Smith 
 700 dollar jeans, keepin your man distance 
 Yeah son, gimme your ear son 
  
 Yo yo yo, yo yo get the fuck away from the ropes man

 As the funky beat continues..[Intro] 
 So we're gonna stand on perimeter 
 We did have some shots fired right down the street on us 
 While this was goin on, so we gotta set up a tight perimeter 
 We got the streets blocked off 
 To make sure we don't have any drivebys on us 
 Other than that, the operation went, fairly well... 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Who told you that? Rolled through, BRRRAT 
 Old to the new, knows who holds the hat 
 Custom tailored fitted, head stayed same size 
 Big since first born, well spitted game wise 
 Same guy, same disguise, sick aim eye stare 
 At thick dame thighs, click claim prize 
 And the lucky contestant was sent 
 A whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement 
 Digital format, provide the ROM 
 Ride calm, flow was like a roadside bomb 
 Flipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing 
 Cameraman wig back, gunner screaming INCOMING 
 RPG, rhyme propelled grenade 
 Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade 
 Bright as the midday sun, then it fade 
 Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed 
 Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin 
 Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin 
 Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps 
 Dogtag attached to explosive human booby traps 
 Where's air support? Ears ringin, mortars whistlin 
 Bloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission 
 Too little too late, as the last man gush 
 Took no prisoners mush, rap ambush 
  
 (MURDALIZING SUCKER EMCEES~!)I tripped a lot out here in the woods lately 
  
 This is a platter of, this makes an, an exceptionally good late night's snack and also a dandy fly swatter 
 Ah, my eyes are going, I can't hit it 
  
 Nothing comes between me and my masters 
  
 (What is it father?) 
 These footprints were by, by the flying monkey men 
 (But they've been restrained in the Valley since we made the pig feet) 
 Yes, that is what disturbs me 
  
 He'd probably get indigestion 
 You will go 
 (I don't think so 
 Take them) 
  
 This jungle is dangerous Trapper 
 You will need assistance 
 (I know what I'm doing) 
  
 You risked your life for us, thanks 
  
 I lost an arm 
 (Good) 
 Stop it father 
 (Stand back 
 Return to the house) 
 No 
  
 What the? 
 Now Trapper, perhaps you will listenGumbo! 
  
 You gotta watch your gums on this 
 But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy 
  
 (Not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal) 
 You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps 
 So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package 
 And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats 
 Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day 
 (It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things 
 Create a new demand for produce 
 Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do 
 And eat more chitlins)[Posdnuos/P-Pain]

 Set it off adrenaline rush, the boys way beyond a pen and the dutch 
 Stronger than hen a bag of the dust, you need to watch how they acting with us 
 Now time to get it in gear, get it in right here 
 Revenge is better than beer, Yo Doom, it's been a minute think they getting it clear (Yeah!) 
 When brothers reunite, make sure we party right 
 We rock it all night long even beyond the morning light 
 It's hard to see him in the light, even harder to see him on the mic 
 A black Benz beats being on a bike, and he can talk a gay chick outta being a dike 
 (New Kurious, y'all) Like that y'all, freak freak y'all (At a store near you) 
 To the beat y'all (Go get it)

 Keep it on click fully auto, I won't stop the rock until pockets thick and gordo 
 More so a risk of sounding poor, bro 
 No tux  who needs tickets to the award show 
 Normally cordial, more or less, less is more or no 
 Hock spit out the cockpit, stuck to the window 'till it's solid as a rock hit 
  
 [Posdnuos/P-Pain] 
 Yes, he is.. 
  
 [Mobonix] 
 He grabbed the mic like two money bags 
 Waiting for the getaway to count what he had 
 Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking 
 The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing 
 Funny man gave 'em nuttin like a bummy dare 
 Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab 
 But that's the life of a villain, and you know after that, chilling 
 Went places got Gracie don't follow, the big joke ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle 
 Writing rhymes till the pen go hollow and been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow 
 And get the villain and scheme, if it's not real life it's still in yo' dreams 
 Like that y'all, like that y'all, like that a like that and like that y'all

 Pushin' on the couch cushion, south side Minneap never lived out in Brooklyn 
 Kept the faith forget the fame 
 If they sweat the name let it set the lane 
 Held mind, cold and hard, had no regard who the chosen are 
 Who, you? Oh no, you played the Oboe, keep it on the low low 
 Rappers are candy butterscotch, I'mma let their baby mothers watch 
 She loves the ock, I touch the spot 
 Bitch, I'm the itch, that must've got up her crotch, heh 
 Now stop, fill the buildings 
 And leave some pills for these little villains 
 Hey shorty, share the flask 
 Let me explain why I wear this mask.. 
  
 Villain! 
 "I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there 
 Gonna make sure you get cracked!"Well anyway 
 You may be saying about now 
 "How in the world is that old fella eat all of that crazy stuff 
 And not get sick to his stomach?" 
 Haha, well, don't worry about that 
 You see, whenever I make a pig of myself on the filet 
 Or the pudding or something 
 I mix up some herbs and 
 I come up with a dandy glass of this 
 Bicarbonate of fig leaf 
 That'll set me free, I'll tell you 
 Ugh 
  
 Edible wrappers may be in grocery stores as soon as months from now 
 You've heard of good to the last drop 
 Well your food could soon be good to the last bite 
  
 Wow! That was loud! 
 Got to ya, huh?

 THAT'S RIGHT! 
  
 Thank you 
 Well, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here 
 Now then, I have to go take my dessert here 
 I have to go 
 I'm conducting a cooking class today 
 Good health to you all! 
 Uh, over this way 
 Look out! 
  
 Alright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal? 
  
 One look at his feature-less face 
 One look was enough to ensure his safety 
 As years passed, he became even more bitter and angry 
 Burning with vengeance against the world 
 Finally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking 
 Then, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland 
 And there he has remained 
 Scheming, dreaming, planning 
 Plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world 
 (I can't believe it!) 
 (Alright, don't make a big deal about it) 
 I warn you Doom, you've gone too far 
 (Yeah!) 
 That'll do it Doom, get your machine[Intro] 
 "And that ended Doom's plans for world destruction!" 
 "And how did you manage to stop him?" 
 "Simple, I [..] rearranged the circuits" 
 "Once he threw the switch" {*bang*} 
 "My ability to attack is faster than the cobra..." {*dialogue fades*} 
 "Very helpful." 
 "And I will be careful, not to make the same mistakes as Doom!" 
  
 [Verse: E. Mason] 
 What's the hero, who's the villain? 
 Dead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin? 
 (Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster? 
 Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast 
 Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays 
 All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore 
 But who knows why it's like this? 
 Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good 
 Really of God, but who should, determine the real 
 Evil, what's the deal 
 Fools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang 
 And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane 
 From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform 
 To really find your essence, take this as a lesson 
 Break away from the rest of them 
 Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song 
 Find truth, who determines wrong 
 From right, without a fistfight 
 Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday} 
 It's just a simple play on words 
 Delete all these punks ass herbs 
 Who's the hero, what's the villain? 
 The question still remains chillin 
 Listen to the music, try very hard to use it 
 Open up and research, and that's the end of this verse 
 But y'all niggas keep y'all minds open out there 
  
 [Outro] 
 "So like fuck you, fuck the newspaper, fuck all that shit man!" 
 "I'm leavin" {"Good evening"} 
 "Yo why you want to be leaving man?" 
 "Man don't worry about that sucker, yo man listen" 
 "Yo I'm not gonna finish my piece man, not with this lady around man" 
 "Yo what the fuck is this shit man?" 
 "I don't like that shit man, I don't want no fuckin pictures taken of my shit man" 
 "Yo relax!" 
 "Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!" 
 "Relax man it's for the paper" 
 "NAH NAH I'm not gonna relax, I'm gettin the fuck out of here" 
 "Look, we got a car! She's got a car parked right over there man!" 
 "Let's get the fuck out of here!" 
 "Well come on let's go then!" 
  
 "Doom, wears body armor to conceal his own mangled form, right?" "Yeah" 
 "So like fuck you" 
 "Do yourself a favor.. do yourself.. trust me"[Produced by MF DOOM]

 Now, who will be the first to tell me of a past adventure?

 Alright. Well as I remember, Doom had threatened the world leaders with destruction of every major city on earth. *Telephone Rings*

 Hold your insulting tongue and mark my words well. I have plotted my revenge on you. Now I shall have it! Bid farewell to your friends!

 [Robot Voice] 
 Operation DoomsdayWhenever I'm expecting a lot of company 
 Haven't had a lot of company in a long time 
 But if I were expecting some 
 I'd whip up a really (ugh) substantial meal 
 You see how strong I am? (heh) 
 It's from eating all this stuff 
  
 Good healthy meal like the...fillet 
  
 Now that's what they call...soul food 
 Now you got black-eyed peas 
 Carrot greens 
 Collard greens 
 Cornbread 
 Watermelon 
 And for dessert 
 Pork butts 
  
 Eat heartily gentlemen 
  
 I got a really stressful day and I really really needed some food 
 Something healthy like beets 
  
 Showed you how good it is 
 Well you may say "I don't think I'd care for that" 
 So you could also fix yourself a...[MF Doom] 
 He moves the crowd like a cursor on zoom 
 No curse words, DOOM the worst church nerd verse heard 
 Appeared blurred to a million true believers 
 He's the supervillain arm dealer to the divas 
 Catch, amongst other world scandals 
 Butter pearl handles to match your girl's sandals 
 Plan was hatched by a pack of old vandals 
 Whose flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils 
 "Hit 'Em to the Head" was the motto 
 And one more time to make sure them dead, BLAKKO 
 When you throw blows in a knife fight, Paco 
 That's how it goes in this Modern Life like Rocko 
 Clock dough 24-7 cycle 
 When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full 
 Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid 
 You're messin with the wrong kids Michael 
 ... it ain't Jack-son 
 For him to flip scripts like camera, action 
 Villain! Raw by the laws of attraction 
 For future generation's information - the black one 
 ... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud 
 The purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle 
 A jerk well renowned for his work skill 
 He's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel 
 MC a show via wi-fi 
 And paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye 
 Hip-Hop sci-fi you can see 
 He had the eye of the tiger through the mask like the Fry Guy 
 Just made a baby Olmec dome check 
 Left some folks' ancestors home wreck 
 With blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil 
 It got no reason, like short people 
 No offense, his feet was burnt brass 
 Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass 
 On his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer 
 All the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw 
 Logic, to keep your mind in the project 
 Drop the check, his job is to chop necks 
 That's just payback for noses there's no psych though 
 What they don't know like Bo 
 Won't hurt Diddley squat 
 Got to be kiddin me, not 
 Seriously plot, to put a hit out on a G-spot 
 Gypped like Egypt out their kettles and they teapot[Verse 1] 
 I'm still dope even if the bag ain't Coach 
 Even if I don't smoke till the hydro roach 
 I'm still dope, rock a thrift store coat 
 And a fresh pair of moccasins 
 Comfortable for walkin' in 
 No A&R marketin' 
 This is my reality 
 Still dope, power walk, burning off the calories 
 Fact and not fallacy, Metal Face family 
 Imminent fatality, taking us too casually, I-- 
 Got it, it's cool, just 
 Part of the school, and I'm 
 Acing the lesson, it's time, so quit stressin' 
  
 [Bridge] 
 Still dope, vibrant, natural game: 
 No ring, no chain, still bringin' the pain 
 Still dope, got no choice but to cope 
 Listen, take notes, I'm showin' you the ropes 
 Still dope, very high dosage 
 My approach is lights out, "Buenos noches." 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Hold my glasses so I can get Riddick 
 Send 'em home tail tucked, holdin' they fitteds 
 Cold as a Guinness--"One pint miss!" 
 Yo Chill, watch the table a fish might flip! 
 Crack jokes spit-- 
 Pop mad shit-- 
 That's what it's made for, cop that quick 
 "Drop that, vic!" Butterfingers, oopsie 
 Signed away your publishing for Jordans and a loosie? 
 The old one-two, see; solo not groupie 
 All over they ass like sweats by Juicy 
 Cats is puss like Sagwa and Morris 
 Stay spittin' lines, there is no chorus 
 Deploying the troublesome, sleep in bubblegum: 
 That's a double dumb, hum if you feel where I'm comin' from 
 Do it till ya lips are numb, you gotta go for it 
 I stay moving forward; I'm baby bear porridge 
  
 [Verse 3] 
 Knick-nack paddywack, fuck ya'll critics 
 This dime on the grind when it come to the spinach 
 Conquered the Id, Vicious like Sid flow 
 Not a nympho, IMpress Official! 
 She rock mikes; you wait to exhale 
 She rock shows like DMC rock Cazals 
 She rock shells, manicured nails 
 Rock for every belle with a spliff to inhale 
 Holdin' she own cone of homegrown shrubbery 
 Won't go hungry: the flow too lovely! 
 Leavin' grills dented on a SUV rented 
 Classic as vintage Impalas that's all tinted 
 Raw bidness: like how them wifeys get hitted 
 Authentic, the track is so love, I'm all in it 
 Aww quit it, of course I'm inclined to shine, did-ick 
 Line for line wit it, climbin' infinite 
  
 [Verse 4] 
 ¿Tu no sabe? Yo soy una bien mala madre 
 Confident aren't we? Playin' it smartly 
 Word to Dios, Estrella is lethal 
 Flow muy frio, roll the dice chico 
 Live crazy decent insanely frequent 
 Strangely sleep wit' one eye open not jokin', outspoken 
 Provokin' and chokin', ego strokin' is lame 
 Word bonder than James, four alarm wit' the flame 
 Way ahead of the game, still playing the same 
 Royalty in my veins, it'll always remain 
 Forever doin' my thing, solo or crew I can hang 
 Like ylang and ylang, bring the Yin to the Yang 
 They got placenta for brains, testing my venomous slang 
 Fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change 
 Some people think I'm deranged, others a little bit strange 
 Just trying to rattle my cage, cause I'm way outta they range[MF Grimm] 
 Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me 
 Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree 
 All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats 
 This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats 
 Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body 
 It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me 
 Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper 
 Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper 
 Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off 
 Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you 
 I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever 
 Angels waste the time, they work together 
 Scheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man 
 I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam 
 Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me 
 I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me 
 Put me out my misery, I live in misery 
 I kill all my enemies, cause I love company 
 Those who seek me, are called wise men 
 Or either wise-guys I pray you comprehend 
 And realize I'm condemned 
  
 No rest, homicidal dreams 
 My cellmate, all he do is scream 
 Out loud how he wants to go home 
 That's funny, I'm here all alone 
 Locked, in a single cell 
 His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell 
 And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat 
 I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets 
 "Where'd he go?" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray "teach me" 
 They don't see him at the health they try to reach me 
 I said "please see how he feels" 
 They said, "He's alright but he's not real" 
 Evaluations say I suffer from depression 
 Hallucinations, self-creations, what they're guessin' 
 I'm here doing years, I'm stressin' 
 Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an' 
 Don't take it cause he said that won't be best an' 
 He said I need his help and he needs me 
 "Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free" 
  
 Home, that was far and he was turned off 
 Cause his wings was burned off 
 A lesson was learned, communicate with one 
 I was chosen cause I'm God's son 
  
 [MF Doom] 
 And I'm the retarded one! 
 (*sings*) Out in the streets 
 You won't survive with, wack-ass beats ("We can see that!") 
 These days and times 
 Watch as we get ours with rhymes 
  
 To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron 
 Who been in to win and blast to the last siren 
 On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick 
 Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik 
 Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees? 
 Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's 
 If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky 
 At your local sleazy speak-easy 
 For any fan of the limelight 
 In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite 
 It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale 
 With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail 
 Jumpin Jehosaphat, who's that? 
 Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do's that" 
 Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko 
 Thought I might do techno 
 Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet 
 For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes 
 Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter 
 Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter 
 Butter, word play since third grade age 
 Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage" 
 Hip hop's Benny Hill sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate 
 My metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring 
 Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing 
 Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting 
 And the super-villain strike again like lightning 
 In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that? 
 And a name-drop like pick the name out the hat 
 That's a no jiver from the, liver conniver 
 Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I 
 Drop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back 
 And spin on your back and then freeze 
 While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero 
 So called rhymers, go call Cleo 
 While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking 
 Super-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin 
 Sometimes the men, mostly from the women 
 I hear voices saying that's the super-villain 
 (Uhh, I hear voices) 
 Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villainWho got the most whips gats and cash? 
 If you ask the villain, he say who gives a rats ass 
 Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe ya last 
 In the meanin in between pass that grass 
 Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank 
 He often'd time drank by the river bank 
 An kept a silver shank, for a calm cat 
 Always stayed strapped for hand to arm combat 
 For DOOM the bell tolls 
 Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes 
 It's filled up to the brim wit sold souls 
 Crackheads dope fiends an 40's of ol' gold 
 Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it 
 Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded 
 Like holly hobby, gosh golly gee 
 The back of hector hoskerish's trolly red wash me 
 Dag nabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet 
 Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit 
 They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett 
 A fiend for the mic an can't kick it like a sick habit 
 Give him a hero's holla 
 Along wit more free dough than Creflo Dollar 
 Holy toledo how he make base on the today show 
 They say he wear a mask in case his face show 
 It's better than a stocking bird brain 
 Find him on the corner rockin mockingbird lane 
 He's a odd man grandma 
 And she's a bad mamma-jamma either squeeze the damn hammer 
 Or stop complainin, on the top he's remainin 
 A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin 
 The people say he's the nicest 
 He only wants to be left alone to his own devices 
 If the price is right he might sing a new smash 
 Then laugh an twist his Rollie Fingers moustache 
 Tear ya crew a new.. gash 
 An prepare a new batch, of his own special herb goulash 
 Villain, the dork who talk funny 
 An he'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk money 
 Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors 
 And beware of the Doomsta[Verse: MC Paul Barman + MF DOOM] 
 I'm old school 
 This mic is my ProTool 
 I'm three apples high 
 I live in a toadstool like a smurf 
 Everyone at birth is given x-ray specs 
 But they under-use them to undress the opposite sex 
 Holy guacamole! 
 Let's get this rap cash 
 'Cause art right now is on some slap-dash, flapjack-crap trash 
 Leave me here 
 Save yourself! 
 Okay—pass me your wallet, I'll send help 
 Mmm—now who drank the last brew? 
 They turned off my cell again 
 The bill was way past due 
 Gosh, tell a friend 
 But don't let 'em gas you 
 It's all just hogwash 
 Now back to the castle 
 Where's that? 
 Parts unknown 
 When I'm home the seeds throw darts at the throne 
 No tart taste to the ho cakes 
 No jakes 
 And first place 
 In the go-cart race goes to— 
 No brakes! Teach peace to the babies 
 We're all the same 
 At least for the ho's sake 
 Stepped on an undisclosed rake 
 Catch a nose-ache... 
 Y'all flows is fake 
 Yodle-eh-hee-who wants to be my protege? 
 Me—me too! 
 So parrot-back it 
 I'm an underlined caret bracket 
 Greater than or equal to 
 But greater than four stars 
 Greater than straight-A report cards 
 Greater than poor sports in divorce courts or sports bars 
 What's your mission? 
 Making hundreds 
 Shaking blunders in this self (inaudible) taking on fun-filled until— 
 Done—chill 
 It ain't all about the dollar bill 
 You could be dead broke and be a scholar still 
 That's true 
 What question should I ask you? 
 Uh—"What type of ill-type of tricks do the mask do?" 
 Okay; what type of ill-type of ill tricks do the mask do? 
 The face plate remove and I give chicks tattoos 
 But then they can see your face! 
 I make 'em look the other way 
 I almost caught a case off that same shit the other day 
 In Grady's truck is where I first got lucky 
 In the 80s, now I make the ladies say, "Yucky!" like Sandy 
 Bollocks, that old mustache is bull-snot 
 On your bald spot 
 Now that's what I call hot! 
  
 [Produced by Prince Paul]He walk around town with a frown like Homey the Clown 
 Shelltoe Lee crown, well blow me down 
 Blow! hell no, he sound funny 
 Outta bounds tryin'ta cop a pound with brown money 
 Keep the change, peep game, the Range 
 Inches on the fringes of a deep steepa' strange 
 When he met a dread at the swine roast 
 Find him in the zone up ahead near the sign post 
 Follow the beat, you won't stumble 
 Shut your mouth, swallow your feet, or try'an rumble 
 In discreet they lie and mumble 
 Catch 'em in the street they as humble as Bryant Gumble cryin' fumble 
 Don't let him get the call 
 Keep a stack a diss rhymes, one-size-fits-all 
 Tries ta' avoid the pitfall 
 Or else get hit in the eye with a old dry spitball 
 You must be crazy out ya mind 
 Even on the days he feel lazy he shout rhymes 
 No chains, no bridge, does get outshined 
 When he come blaze it people say it's about time 
 The old God with the old gold gold card 
 When he's on the road it's no-holds-barred 
 No lard, in the record game on some bull guard 
 So many nekked dames he might blow his whole wad 
 He learn somethin' new everyday 
 Go ahead and burn, they ain't nothin' to do anyway 
 'cept sell tracks out the Cheverolet like lemonade 
 And go gold in the hood so he can get ghetto paid 
 Now that's usin' the ol' cranium 
 Like the jewelry cat who sold him fake plat uranium 
 Guaranteed to turn necks green like the Hulk 
 Have it manufactured by machine in bulk 
 They rock 'n roll like: 'Stop, Drop . . .' 
 And if they got soul, then welcome to the sock hop 
 Hip-be-bop at ya block mom 'n pop shop 
 Time it when when it comes to rhymin' is chop-shop 
 Keep it lit till the last stroke'a the pen 
 And ya don't quit like ya quit smokin' again 
 They said he keep his lyrics poked in a tin 
 And his secret recipe, soak it in some gin 
 Brings the heat like a radiator 
 Stays on beat with the mask like a gladiator 
 Sword is the mic cord 
 And he came to turn it out like a dike broad out the psych ward 
 I recollect when he first took the sector 
 He use the connect-the-dot styles as a mic checka 
 Told him give the deposit, book the lecture 
 The crooked look wrecka, HOOKS IS EXTRA!!![Chorus] 
 You put my feet back on the ground 
 Did you know you brought me around [Somersault] 
 You were sweet and you were sound 
 You saved me 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 She wondered would it hurt again, a scary new setting 
 A Mary Lou Retton perfect 10 -- was it worth it then? 
 Would have made the clique switch way back 
 For a quick pitch in the haystack 
 With a bad bitch like Payback with interest 
 Used to keep her nice coo trimless 
 Flipped it for a high school gymnast 
 She was thicker than the kick off "Supersonic" 
 Sicker than the bubonic, to Vik it was platonic 
 Wow, found a new playmate 
 At this late stage in the game he couldn't get the name straight 
 Told her "it was all up in your calf muscle" 
 Showed her how to pull it off, all laugh and tussle 
 At one point she thought he was a lame cat, with game for the rats 
 A dog to claim the blame at 
 Told her "Maybe it's your momma fault, for giving you the shaker" 
 Summi-summi-somersault 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You put my feet back on the ground 
 Did you know you brought me around [Somersault] 
 You were sweet and you were sound 
 You saved me 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Butterflies at the very mention 
 The flutter of her eyelashes help to clear the tension 
 Then went and tripped and fell head over heels 
 V, and got dirtier than Red Rover's wheels 
 No matter how high-stake the price 
 This good-luck charm on his arm shake the dice 
 It's gymnastics, practice makes nice 
 She's not the type to be enticed by fake ice 
 Aah -- the stench of first love 
 The quench of the thirst made it worse 
 Truly the burst of upper-thrust motion 
 Trust, devotion 
 Lust is like the sand where the beach meets the ocean 
 Soaking, felt joy in the whirlwind 
 Never ever did he ever mention boyfriend/girlfriend 
 Demanded her respect 
 Then ran and did a handspring, almost landed on her neck 
  
 [Chorus] 
 You put my feet back on the ground 
 Did you know you brought me around [Somersault] 
 You were sweet and you were sound 
 You saved me[Mister Fantastic] 
 It was back in the days when I met a brilliant student named DOOM 
 Hello? Anybody home? 
 Wow, look at that equipment 
 I wonder what DOOM is working on 
 Now I'll just rearrange a few of these circuits 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 What are you doing in my room? 
  
 [Mr. Fantastic] 
 You're even more stupid than I thought 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 Give me those papers 
  
 [Mr. Fantastic] 
 I just came by to say hello 
 But you'd better recheck those equations 
 You're off a few decimals 
 And that means big trouble if you use this material 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 Get out of here[Dr. Doom] 
 I'll have to go ahead with my experiment right now 
 Lower the dome 
 Are you ready, Costez? 
  
 [Costez] 
 All set 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 My moment of triumph is at hand 
 Contact 
  
 [Raymond 'Zoro'] 
 It's messed up 
  
 [Rose] 
 It doesn't look bad 
  
 [Raymond 'Zoro'] 
 You're crazy, it looks bad 
  
 [Rose] 
 Okay, then at least tell me what this thing that you're doing 
  
 [Raymond 'Zoro'] 
 This figure in the middle, it’s not even coming out right 
 I’ve already got like the hands like on the side, like the hands of doom, and they’re like representing the city, and the environment around this artist 
 And he’s like, like, he’s like by himself in his own world and what not 
 He don’t care about nobody around him, and that’s what the hands are, everybody around him 
  
 [Rose] 
 Yeah, who is this character? 
 That's you 
  
 [Raymond 'Zoro'] 
 Who told, what gave, what gave you that idea? 
  
 [Rose] 
 C'mon man, I've been knowing, I've knowing for a long time that was you 
 Nah nahIn lak'ech planetary kin 
 Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin 
 In the flesh with a band of merry men 
 Innocent civilians hari kari over yen 
 Is it the end or for pretend? 
 I can neither condemn, nor defend 
 Cats, that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin 
 Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rapping friend 
 Again, shame on us 
 We in the same game, put the blame on Gus 
 Study til your brain vomit 
 Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets 
 Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk a junk trunk 
 Metal palm on your ma's badunkadunk 
 In a park in a rave under three days of darkness 
 Tell a hater behave and spark this 
 With the fresh banana berry blend 
 Counting mad tens 'til when January begin 
 The other hand clutched to a pen, 24/7 much to his chagrin 
 Used to drink gin, now he only drink oxygen water 
 Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins sorta 
 And if they ever come get me 
 We were sippin rum on a number one jitney 
 I can neither confirm nor deny 
 On account of the sherm all high 
 Villain make 'em squirm 'til her perm all dry 
 Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly 
 It's germs, and mad babies to kiss 
 Won't stop rockin except to maybe take a piss 
 Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat 
 Holding a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat 
 Step aside, give him some room playa 
 Til the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer (slayer)[Hook] 
 Is he ill? 
 Do he really fit the bill? 
 Spit to kill? 
 Keep things real? 
 Know the drill? 
 The ledge edge still? 
 Catch wreck at will? 
 (Repeat x2) 
  
 [Verse 1: MF Doom] 
 Today's forecast, a slight chance of flurries 
 Slightly slim chance that they might dance to worries 
 And won't know what to say, break to a cutaway 
 DOOM like the rain known to come back another day 
 Like this day like now-a-day be right there 
 Like I, O, A, gimme half a light year 
 Same time it take y'all to drink a light beer 
 Feel the wrath of his truth just like the cast from Nightmare 
 Whoever got the cash, the mic, they both right here 
 What more can I say? keep your sights clear 
 Bare facts, triple naked to bare backs 
 He only came to jack rare tracks for your earwax 
 Oh snap! You hear that? Naw 
 DOOM stay way up in the cut like Ma and Pa 
 When he come out he dumb out, there he go 
 The villain with the illest flow in all of Mexico 
 All foes on some when he leave out let me know 
 Just so's I can breath out before I let go 
 Rappers is like Satchmo that you best know 
 Invest in free dough like Matthew Lesko 
 Followed by hailstorms, snow and earthquakes 
 Give out more toothaches than first birthday cakes 
 The more we reverse scripts the worse they fate 
 To beat y'all with dimes and dummy Anbesol shake 
 Now you got a rhyme tummy ache by mistake 
 Can't call it, can't call Jake, call cannonball face 
 Dig tapes and stay in great shape 
 Today's rap game is like one big date rape 
 The name ring bell like ring ding dong 
 He can never be wrong like Ling Ting Tong 
 Once heard a hit song, sounded like an annoying gong 
 It's so wack, I ain't wanna hit the bong 
 Now who get iller with the pen than I do? 
 And in it just to get the benjamin like Netanyahu? 
 Let the god bless you like Achoo! 
 Get you like whats that on your chest, got you 
 PNS beat good for you it's shredded wheat 
 As well as getting shredded by the metal headed lead feet 
 Son 'em and dead 'em like a dad that's dead beat 
 Beat him like a dead horse, nasty as red meat 
 DOOM memorize rhymes and still forgot 
 Call it how he see it and kill a shot, like Willard Scott 
 In the place to be like no iller spot 
 To spill a knot, it's like a chilling thriller plot 
 Starring the villain as the black Jesus 
 If it ain't the 'gnac or the Jack it's Grey Goose 
 Still could stay loose off grape juice regardless 
 Nevertheless did his best on the retarded test 
 It's trick questions, always kept a cheat sheet 
 On the microphone, a rep up before Beat Street 
 And beat meat that MF DOOM he stay true 
 If you online check the site and FAQ 
  
 [Hook][Principal] 
 Doom, are you awake? 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 Yes, but what do you want? 
  
 [Principal] 
 You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself. So, before you cause greater harm— 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 Get out of here! This is just a minor disappointment. I shall overcome it 
  
 [Reed] 
 The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy 
 For a few days later, his bandages were removed 
  
 [Nurse] 
 There. Aah! How horrible, that face 
  
 [Dr. Doom] 
 What have I done to myself? My face is...hideous! He made me hurry my experiment! Now I must hide my face from all mankind. But he will pay. Oh, how he will pay! 
  
 [Reed] 
 So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear 
  
 [Commissioner Robbins] 
 Why did DOOM threaten just to— 
  
 [Reed] 
 Well, like I said he just disappeared. I'll never forgot that dayThe lust is show the story, grodier than Mr. Crowley 
 For those embarrassed to know holier than Darrell Morley  habits 
 Paris to the Gobi bring him up to speed slowly 
 On the low key, Kindles is phony D 
 Taste stale, see the world in shades of gray-scale 
 Right there in black and white, protected by chain-mail 
 Today’s the day, made your way see ya sister'n'um 
 Took my little mens with her, told em loved em.. kisseded them 
 These over-sensitive youngins' is on some new stuff 
 Can't sit still and focus the time it takes to do enough 
 From the mean streets of the ‘Can I get a dollar dude?’ 
 Above measure the singular pleasure of solitude 
 It’s your poison, if you so choose, absorb it 
 Veins to the brain, shoot off into orbit 
 How you know octagon? Or much less Tetragrammaton 
 To get the good stuff you gotta get out to the Amazon 
 With any luck you might just score locally 
 Keep it on the hush when you speakin' on it vocally 
 Then you gotta be on the in, a known member 
 I think I still owe 'em lil something since November, whatever 
 Who need credit when cash speak? Forget it 
 Sweatin' sittin on this package since last week 
 We all got weaknesses, even the functionin' dead 
 Some’ll end up fudgin' numbers, buggin' and lunchin' instead 
 It’s Netflix to the head, second best trick to get the chicks in the bedLooks like I hit the jackpot! (Supervillain!) 
 That's the best part of all! I'm working for the biggest group of villains this world has ever known! We're led by the man himself! (The Supervillain!) [Yuh!] Doom's got a plan that's gonna shake the heavens...You wanna get tough punk?! Good! Time to get the feta![Bumpy Knuckles] 
 Yo what's up DOOM, This is Bumpy Knuckles 
 Just calling to say that I'm proud of the work you been doing dog 
 You know this whole album and all that that you've been working on my dude 
 It's like, it's like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to 
 Look into the mind of a villain, you know like somebody who really has 
 A serious outlook on their craft, you know there's a lot of clowns out here 
 With you know, painted faces and when they take the paint off 
 It's just a clown with no paint on their face [DOOM laughing] 
 So please understand my dude I'm watching you man and I see what you doing 
 It's the OG man Bumpy Knuckles straight fly, aight? 
 My motto for 2009 is fuck everybody [DOOM laughing], aight? 
 So when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd 
 Ask them to put it back up 
 And when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody [DOOM laughing] 
 Cause that's what everybody's gonna say when they have to show respect for you 
 Ahh fuck him, fuck him that's the dinkest shit in the world if they write this 
 Well fuck you 
 Cause everybody wanna be what you are 
 You nah'mean? They can't find 
 Themselves 
 Aight, stay focused my dude I appreciate your work 
 Aight? Soon come: Bumpy Knuckles, MF DOOM— soon come 
 Peace[Verse 1] 
 DOOM get rude with the dude off CHiPs 
 The mood switch, he chewed off strips of a Broodwich 
 Danger make a groove off a glitch 
 Major boo booty twitch and a crew rich bitch 
 Always wanted to say that 
 Ever since the days of hallways taunting a stray cat 
 The one he often frequently slapped around 
 All the while waited and graduated cap and gown 
 Hated the rap sound, debated the crap 
 Until he felt he had it mapped down 
 Enough to have the game trapped and bound 
 Scratched in the crown was the names of lames who yapped a noun 
 Or verb for that matter 
 Had no data for a herb who chat chatter 
 Oh, Erik Estrada 
 Fat rat, the mask made 'em batty as a mad hatter 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 Known for his absurd word choices 
 And will ignore you if you ask him if he heard voices 
 Look, the energy is crazy 
 Far as he was concerned the enemy was lazy 
 Ahem, your attention please 
 Freeze, he came to seize the free cheese 
 Before he flees to Belize 
 In case he forgot to mention, squeeze these 
 Just keep it on a need to know basis 
 They knew he was a negro so no need to show faces 
 Back in the days of no laces 
 On a slow pace they used to say he might could go places 
 Ehh, whatever their case is 
 The card he played was ace of spades, but no races 
 A spastic, some called loony 
 When he spit a tune sarcastic as Paul MooneyMF DOOM - “Impostas”

 [Intro: MF DOOM] 
 The Supervillian versus the gold-digger 
 DOOM mild-mannered old nigga 
 Supporter for the daily blues 
 Reporter for the jewel, drop news, pop Israeli tools 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 The world-renowned master of word game 
 Who lay low sometime behind iceberg nerd frames 
 (Ayyo, MF) They heard the name, but just couldn’t 
 Quite place the rep if they retraced they steps 
 Next EP, who to give thanks ta? 
 Here lies the pranksta who tried to test a gangsta 
 The last thing he saw was a potato 
 From the lone NATO who hosts his own late show 
 Keep a low lab on Monsta Island like Seinfeld 
 White-wine clientele connected like Mind Meld 
 I can tell they sees these styles as too tricky 
 They’re too picky on this microphone doohickey 
 MF, Monday through Friday, get money 
 Saturday through Sunday, the brown Al Bunday 
 Waiting for the shit you’re kicking as the plot thickens 
 He wrote these rhymes in 3-D with red and blue BIC pen 
 And to the chickens, only hoes who say, “Let me hold ‘em” 
 Take him in their mouth while he’s semi-swollen—semicolon 
 I told him words would do a nigga brutal 
 For not using his noodle, F up and get bamboozled 
 He was the one to open to her up, blow her brains 
 Back, dope her up or rope her to the train tracks 
 Or he would choke her ‘til she collapse, steal/steel 
 To poker/poke her with the wood, and tell her, “Be good” 
 He could take a phrase like “Peter Piper picked a pepper” 
 And put it where he couldn’t peep a sniper, sicker repper 
 Nigga poppa, stick a chick proper 
 Double-platinum, Oprah, soap-opera watchers, gossipers 
 On top of her 
  
 [Bridge: MF DOOM and (Sample)] 
 (I keep forgetting) can’t go 
 Raw anymore 
 (I keep forgetting) rappers is 
 Impostas.  Been a show-stopper since a ho-hopper 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 Never came second place in a neck-and-neck race 
 To the naked face who wanna battle: bring a neck brace 
 We supply the insult to injury 
 Whoever in the industry getting money is too stingy 
 Violate, you might as well smoke me, loc 
 Relocate, migrate, or get caught with the okey-doke 
 It’s guaranteed it’s your last step, so step to me 
 With the Uzi, watch that first step—it’s a doozy 
 Time flies as the hourglass trickles sand 
 One last thing before I blao this popsicle stand: 
 A rolling stone, and that’s that.  At home 
 On the microphone like, “That’s where he laid his hat at” 
  
 [Outro: MF DOOM and (Sample)] 
 (I keep forgetting) 
 Keep making dough 
 (I keep forgetting)

 "Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register." 
  
 [Verse: MF DOOM + Samples] 
 In lak'ech, planetary kin ("Step aside, boy...") 
 Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin (V-Villain!) 
 In the flesh with a band of merry men 
 Innocent civilians hari kari over yen ("Uh!") 
 Is it the end or for pretend? 
 I can neither condemn, nor defend 
 Cats that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin 
 Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rappin' friend ("Uh!") 
 Again; shame on us 
 We in the same game, put the blame on Gus 
 Study till your brain vomit 
 Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets 
 Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk-a-junk trunk 
 Metal palm on your ma's ba-dunk-a-dunk 
 In a park in a rave under three days of darkness 
 Tell a hater, "Behave and spark this" 
 With the fresh banana berry blend ("Step aside, boy...") 
 Countin' mad tens than when January begin 
 The other hand clutched to a pen 
 24/7—much to his chagrin 
 Used to drink gin, now, he only drink oxygen water 
 Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins, sorta 
 And if they ever come get me 
 We were sippin' rum on a number one jitney (Ya wit' me?) 
 I can neither confirm nor deny 
 On account of the sherm—all high 
 Villain make 'em squirm till her perm all dry 
 Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly 
 It's germs and mad babies to kiss 
 Won't stop rockin', 'cept to maybe take a piss 
 Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat ("Step aside...") 
 Holdin' a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat 
 Step aside, give him some room, player ("Step aside, boy...") 
 Till the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer

 "Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register."

 [Verse 1: Kool Keith] 
 Batman and Robin, head bobbin', no Joker Penguin 
 You see him freezin' up like Mr. Freeze, Catwoman on the mind 
 The Batmobile design, Alfred the butler 
 Dynamic-duo hustlers 
 Burn rubber, Gotham City, I'm spinnin' in the gutter 
 Left the Batcave full of computers, the Mad Hatter 
 The realest, see my boss red like Twizzlers 
 I'm so hot like Hot Wheels, color shifters 
 Diagonal over Gotham City lookin' pretty 
 The caped crusader continue through the stages like a player 
 Pullin' up on The Joker while he playing poker 
 King Tut hoppin' out the range rover with brolic shoulders 
 Green Hornet and Kato see the Lamborghini doors open 
 Same rims on the BM as the Lotus 
 Dark blocks and they pop like pop rocks 
 Your girl on the cock, she jock a lot, the next episode, reload 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 Cock the swammy back, don't hesitate, react, believe dat 
 They defecate where they eat at 
 More repulsive than the Boars Head logo 
 The trees had em seein' impulses in slow-mo, whoa 
 A whole lot of funk, a whole lot of drunk, who knows? 
 Could've did a line of bump with Donald Trump 
 He hear voices in his head, he gotta jump 
 Not now, too much lactose, gotta dump 
 A wise owl, growl with a mean scowl 
 A stand up dude even when he seeing foul, meanwhile 
 The world keeps on spinnin' 
 It seems the forces of evil keep on winnin' 
 Change of plans, and I'll take that off your hands 
 Retreat back to the cave with your mans 
 Super Vill, salute Milk D, top bill 
 Top notch or chop meat and chop krill 
 In the mix of trappin' and gun clappin' 
 DOOM, 25 years in, son slappin' 
 Wrote the key to life down on some napkin

 Ooh, so many flows 
 Shit goes, so many ways down and below 
 20-10 thousand leagues under the sea 
 Motherfuckers never know it was me 
 Oh, that nigga' flew so many flows 
 It's like so many fly colors on the hoe toes 
 God dammit, motherfucker ruling whole planet 
 Gimme' two times, cut no shit, nah, fuck it 
 I'm coming through kicked the bucket one day 
 Motherfuckers never see a nigga parle 
 Like, lay in the cut, like, he never knew 
 Motherfucker, Super Villain 
 And who the fuck is you? Ooh 
  
 [Kurious] 
 One two, one two 
 In order TO make a jam, kid 
 We gotta' get it back up in the zone 
 Mad shit the way we be spittin, when we writing shit is on 
 I'm fucking it up cause right now 
  
 [MF Doom] 
 See Imma be serious my next verse, Imma just be serious (Yeah) 
 I be starting to laugh, that's my problem 
  
 [Kurious] 
 That's my problem too, my shit sound like on some funny shit 
 You know what's hot? The way we keep talking 
 I'm taking off the headphones  to talk you you 
 But it's dope, cause we talkin' and still doin' it to the music 
  
 [MF Doom] 
 So wait, then the beat's too loud? 
 I keep the beats kinda low, like this and shit 
  
 [Kurious] 
 No, nah I don't the levels are fucked up 
 Oh you mean to keep the tone down?

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, kinda like riding like right there, right there, be like yo

 (Good things...) 
  
 [Kurious] 
 Nope-a nope, nope 
  
 [MF DOOM] 
 He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him 
 Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one 
 Can't put shit past him 
 Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him 
 Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man 
 Stand close to his main man like a chain gang 
 Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew 
 That's no mystery what Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew 
 Sorta with her drawers down quarter 
 The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta" 
 I suggest you hand over the formula doula 
 A villain in your land, in his land a ruler 
 Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura 
 Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller 
 Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet 
 No matter how you spell it, we still got beats 
  
 [Kurious] 
 People question how we live, question what we give 
 Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me 
 Still they judge, but they be butt ass 
 Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it 
 Light's the fuel, mic is the tool 
 Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start 
 Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it 
 Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44 
 Contemplate, meditate, dictate 
 I direct my direct fate, coming of late 
 Kurious, can I say shit 
 Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit

 [MF DOOM] 
 By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out 
 Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about 
 Topics and views, generally concerned about 
 With different ways to come up and earn clout 
 I take a look at my life and pace the trails 
 From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils 
 You out your frame but still bagging 'em too 
 You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you 
 Like my twin brother, we did everything together 
 From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers 
 Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys 
 I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles 
 The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock 
 Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block 
 I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand 
 Everything is going according to plan man(x3) 
 I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend 
 Under summers magic spell 
 But when autumn came her love did not remain 
 And made my world a living hell[Instrumental][Instrumental]Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and 
 Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand 
 Tillin' the wasteland sands 
 Raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin' fan 
 He rest when he's ashes 
 Ask em after ten miles of his goulashes, smashes stashes 
 Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster 
 A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster 
 They supposed ta know. It show when his aura glow 
 Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible 
 Time is money spend way save invest the fess 
 From ten case of cave with chicken chest S 
 Yes ya'll the dub will get your trickles 
 The best ballers pitch in to rub and get a nickels 
 But tut tut, he about to change the price again 
 It go up each time, he blow up like hydrogen 
 Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear 
 And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire 
 Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama 
 Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma 
 Once sold a inbred skinhead a nigga joke 
 Plus a brand new chrome smokin' with the triggers broke 
 I thought I told em "firing pins was separate" 
 He find out later when he tries to go an rep it 
 Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah 
 Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta 
 One monkey don't stop no slaughter 
 A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border 
 Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill 
 Flow skill, still there's no thrill 
 Villa bill ya 10K bills in his pilla 
 Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with... 
 Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix 
 Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick 
 Sketch lyric, bet 'cha by the nick on some vic 
 Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick 
 Sick slick, hidden in a book 
 The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook 
 Listen, don't look now, keep walkin' 
 Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin' 
 Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often 
 Coughin to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then 
 He's like Warf, some say stronger though 
 Off the top J strong bow, play along bro 
 Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show 
 Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro 
 For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow 
 A actress and some nympho bimbo 
 He's playin' Ray Jay the old tape 
 DOOM - well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape 
 Fill it to the rim like brim 
 Villain and ya won't find him in no gym 
 Probably a foggy bog with the frogs 
 With a dot on the guard as he squat on log 
 Half cocked and half baked 
 Used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shake 
 My mistake, sign a track agreement 
 For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement 
 In any event it's fake like wrestlin' 
 Get em like Jake The Snake on mescalines 
 Ahem, elixir for the dry throat 
 Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote 
 By remote, send in the meat wagon 
 Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin' 
 These stats are staggerin' 
 Had his PHD in indiscreet street hagglin' 
 Villain, his agenda is clear 
 Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here 
 It's not meant for the seein' 
 Went through the celin' after enterin' his center bein' 
 A new meanin' to sales through the roof 
 Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof 
 It's the return of the tramp 
 Who do a duet jam when Earnest goes to camp 
 For the right earn - na'mean like Vern 
 We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn 
 Jiminy crickets 
 One mans waste is another mans soap 
 Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope 
 A real weirdo with a bug rare flow 
 And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow 
 He wears a mask so the charge won't grab 
 On a rooftop with a large stone slab 
 Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish 
 Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorous'h 
 Black licorice and equally as yucky 
 How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie 
 Monkey hustle, man on fire 
 Later for the date than the Hadron Collider 
 And cost more, it be singin' like a style 
 DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile 
 Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels 
 In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules 
 Fools, the roach was never dead 
 Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head 
 Instead it was depicted as flicked in 
 Split the wig, slitKeep your mind on your mask, kid 
 Holler for my classics, it's drastic 
 Villain the hydrochloric acid, splashed it 
 Pull the Nine, reached then he blasted, Pow! 
 Pin stripes on a basket 
 New York style wild 
 Cheddar grab easy 
 It's only entertainment though, when thought out completely 
 Sad demeanor, could get him the drop and bag cleaner 
 Master schemer 
 Expert in that arena 
 Puffin' Pasadena 
 You read the grass was greener 
 Black beamer 
 I8 she gyrate 
 Rubbing shoulders with pigs don't fly straight 
 Just ate, causing indigestion 
 Will soon regurgitate, into profits, no question 
 Nosy agent sniffing around, pay attention 
 You could take that to the bank 
 "Thanks", don't mention 
 Pleasure's all mine, ain't mad at y'all 
 Clear advantage like playing paddle ball on adderall 
 Be brief, that is all 
 Aight, one more rhyme 
 Self-snitching rappers who's lines is pure pork rinds 
 It's yours, it's his, and mine 
 Your homework space cubical, smirk face crucible 
 Super luminal, (???), loose pull 
 Need to re-roll that, he sold stat old hat 
 And Dungarees, new shoes for baby 
 Food, clothing and shelter, no if ands or maybes 
 Maintain the gravy train, laid claims of slavery 
 Bad investment banking, the best went blanking 
 Shitting, stanking 
 Witnessing the slang king, hypnotist ranking 
 And don't quit 
 Keep your mind on your mask, kid 
 Holler for my classics, it's drastic 
 DOOM, hydrochloric acid, splashed it 
 Pull the Nine, reached then blasted, Pow![Intro]

 Motherfucker, it's my goddamn honor 
 To eat a sucka MC like a hot lamb döner 
 Respect rook check dope blind dialectic 
 Took the perspective of open-minded skeptic 
 Where your skeptical's looks don't count 
 Better off judgin' by rhymebooks and sheer amounts 
 And work backwards from there 
 Angle of attack on a track was like a spear through the clear air *tongue-click*

 Sensations of latter day saints 
 Immortalized in black splattered spray paint, Faint 
 Ain't live and direct and kept his eye on the game 
 Like SpyTec 
 Mic check 
 Villain get booted out your online school 
 Student got straight-up A's in divine rule 
 Quicker than a sleight of hand like, "Damn" 
 Telepathy and telekinesis faster than InstaGram 
 See what he said, layin' his wood, get paid is at 
 From the States to your estate flat, ain't that[Instrumental][Intro: MF DOOM] 
 He wants to get his girlfriend? Go get your girlfriend 
 Ay! And now...you is 'bout to dance, like you ain't never danced before 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 This one'll have you get the trash hash out the stash, as they say, "Ash to Ash" 
 Jewels free rash fools ask the mask 
 Need me? I'll be peeing in the pool, ka-splash 
 You may feel a slight drizzle 
 Villain'll give a squealer a candlelight vigil 
 Couldn't find a healer with a whistle and a line of sight 
 And he hold the mic like a fistful of dynamite 
 They wonder how he built his C-note tower 
 All before zero hour it's tree grow power 
 Then he go shower to scour off the funk 
 And watch his soul call comp cower soft punk 
 The god is the oddest fella you'll find 
 Paid to speak his mind like father jealous and vine 
 He came to rock the banquet, rank it 
 Along with two of the baddest broads to act stank wit, blank spit 
 Dilla raise the beat like a anchor banker 
 Overstand (?) plays the heat 
 'll shank a wanker 
 Drank a tank of angst, thank ya 
 Guess what? Chicken head butts 
 Hit a rhyme on time, I kicked him dead in the nuts 
 Oh, the victim had guts 
 Prepare to stick 'em, I'll slick 'em in the cut 
 Go. Sell a spear chucker voodoo 
 Got it her off wholesale male smug lou spew 
 So. Sell a bear a truck of doodoo 
 Foes go to hell in a seersucker muumuu 
  
 [Verse 2: Guilty Simpson] 
 Doom! 
 Guilty! 
 Dilla, Dilla! 
 Grind for the paper, hot like Sanka 
 Top notch ranker, clock my banker 
 Dead Presidents, sick dudes - I'm the medicine 
 Storming in your residence when I'm in my element 
 No contest, I get hot and go unconscious - ya boy is automatic 
 Now go play in traffic, the flow is graphic 
 With no theatrics, still rock sold out shows for practice 
 Call it a walk-through. Def. The wrong one to talk to 
 Beef ain't nothin I can't stick a fork through 
 We break bread, eat good, and pour brew 
 Cheers! 
 Come toast to the one with respect to the utmost on more than one coast 
 GS, check the style I splash, to make the listener wanna pile my cash 
 King of the Hill, money is the issue 
 It's all on me tell 'em bring me the bill 
 Daddy Warbucks, shift gears in the armored truck 
 Like Big Daddy Kane when I warm it up 
 Fans scream for the two man team 
 Doom and Guilty - Hip Hop supreme 
 The denim is blue but the pockets green 
 Big knots in jeans, you can't stop the kings[Instrumental][Intro] 
 In the year of 1994 
 A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Earthquake is here 
 Straight up 
  
 [Verse 1:Earthquake] 
 I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper 
 When I fuck up I can just use my eraser 
 Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout 
 Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout 
 My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake 
 I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake 
 I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em 
 I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um 
 Earthquake is up when they come to [?] 
 I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven 
 I get the nack when I pack 
 A 3-5-7 in my sack 
 Cuz I'm short of a new jack 
 Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek 
 I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique 
 I get the inspiration 
 When I see the girls in jubilation 
 Racing to my place and 
 Wanna touch my face 
 As I start to pace and race 
 Brush em' off like toothpaste 
 So think twice if you wanna step to this miss 
 I'll have ya burnin' like [?] 
 Hey up ya can't leave without no say so 
 If we were [?] I take all yo' pace so 
 [?] this is earthquake on yo stereo 
 Fuck with me I leave you soggy like yo' cereal 
 I'm gone, checkmate 
  
 [Hook] 
 Make a move like chess then checkmate 
 I make a move like check, nigga then checkmate 
 Move like chess, nigga, checkmate 
 I make a move like chess, nigga 
 Then I yell checkmate 
  
 [Verse 2: MF Doom] 
 Back as the invisible killer up on yo' screen 
 So get yo neck thumpin' between my guillotine 
 Checking magazine for x the unseen 
 Mad niggas know what I mean 
 I come clean as a whistle 
 Or filthy as my last pistol 
 Mine get you now- BUST 
 I get down to the bristle and burn em' 
 Like from up under the mistletoe 
 With the ho and she ain't even 
 [?] like a flow tec 
 Switch, i'm the suspicious, viscious X 
 So shit i'm a mission got this punk like a 
 Yo probably [?] I say like a fish 
 But bust a how I front punk 
 Punk I get em' like a blunt 
 And my middle finger index 
 A thumb [?] a bum nigga 
 A son of a gun 
 Squeeze the trigger hallelusa 
 Looser than the bullshit ya used to 
 I jam like a tec' I am the [?] 
 Master of the zero harrasser of yo' zip code 
 Disaster to the superhero, flipmode 
 In 93' I heard mad emcees that annoyed me 
 Like DTs on CDs 
 Checkmate 
  
 [Hook] 
 I make a move like that, then I yell checkmate 
 Makin' moves like chess, nigga, checkmate 
 I make a move like chess nigga then I yell checkmate 
 Makin' moves like chess, kid, checkmate 
  
 [Verse 3:?] 
 I cremate, dominate 
 Then sell some lemonade 
 10 cents a cup, little kid 
 Then I terminate like Arnold 
 Schwarzenegger 
 I am a little bigger 
 Ten shades darker than that 
 With the itchy finger 
 My whole game is a bible 
 I kill a nigga dead 
 With some lead 
 And put my head on his [?] bible 
 I swear to God I didn't do it 
 It's just another day of my life 
 [?] i'm sick and you niggas knew it 
 I'm crossing criss cuz i'm pissed 
 Time to diss 
 [?] for doing a motherfucking twist 
 I hid the body now it's over 
 The cops are havin' a really bad time finding that ass like a four leaf clover 
 So before you check me and try to do me 
 Quaka' kick ya ass just like Hong Kong-Fui (CHIKA) 
  
 [Outro] 
 Checkmate 
 I just crossed the board and I got checkmate 
 I just crossed the board and I got checkmate 
 I just crossed the board and I got checkmate 
 I got the checkmate I got the checkmate[Produced by MF DOOM][Instrumental][Instrumental][MF Doom] 
 Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fail 
 Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale 
 Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail 
 Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell? 
 Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well 
 Since last week the bootlegger been in jail 
 If all else fail, inhale the ale 
 Makin sure they can't see your sale via snail mail 
 Mind like a sewer, servin rhyme on a skewer 
 Doom'll step to a fine dime like he knew her 
 My black sister, she said "Step back" before he kissed her 
 She did the dipper and the smack just missed her 
 There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger 
 99% of rap is just a friendly issue to 
 I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all 
 Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball 
 Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come 
 Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums 
 Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em 
 Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like steak'um 
 Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paparika? 
 One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker 
 Every week or so peaked out the lab though, eureka 
 A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker 
 For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all 
 It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all 
 Skeeter, got Peter to pay Paul 
 So you can drink it on Mary so she can play ball 
 ... So let her have my scrilla 
 And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly 
 And rhymin to remember what you told me 
 Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley? 
 Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me 
 Whoever don't feel him build walls like a goalie 
 One for the money, two for the better green 
 Three for methanine-dioxymethamphetamine 
 Told the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend 
 Tell him it's for Medellín and use oxyacetylene 
 Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay 
 Leave a wig like it was havin a bad hair day 
 Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret 
 He said Shasta, and turned to formaldehyde faster 
 When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily 
 One night she tried to flail me with her ukelele 
 Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat 
 With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat 
 ... You better have my scrilla 
 Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly 
 Remind me to remember what you told me 
 Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley? 
 Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me 
 And if you don't feel him build walls like a goalie[Produced by MF DOOM][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental]No friendly warfare, this ain't wrestlin' 
 There's nothin' staged over here, you're trippin' Mescaline 
 Drinkin', coulda got smacked for what he thinkin' 
 Coulda said the word, then whack! Abe Lincoln 
 And still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin' 
 This game's built to get got while blinkin' 
 Rappers do big up jail like a recruiter 
 Let 'em tend ta hit a boy, said he was a shooter 
 Told him "Man up, or keep it pushin' like a scooter" 
 Then said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha 
 Lo and behold, police shows up 
 Spit his shitty sixteen and got his self froze up, up 
 His story had a moral, it's buried in the soil 
 Vil put it in her back like the epidural 
 Kids: eat, sleep, stay away from creeps 
 Spit it from the heart, this game's for keeps 
 So peep 
 Yeah, saga of a true B-Boy 
 Beware any likenesses or imagery is a decoy 
 Sho nuff, yo fluff, force like Bruce Leroy 
 Bring trouble up and get double cut— keloid 
 Bubble up, run 'em up, destroy 
 And anything else you see— void 
 Rightful ownership 
 Got a bone to pick with the phoniest colonialist 
 Who own a ship 
 The loneliest known to rip 
 Known to sip pine and ripple 
 Find yourself in a bind and pickle 
 Don't bite the hand that feeds you, bite the nipple 
 In this land of black and brown, ain't no backin' down 
 As foul as that sound, it's hard to find a cap and gown 
 But it's always like a MAC around 
 B-r-r-r-r-at!! Man down 
 Metal is empowered, devil is a coward 
 It all smells of high hell like no one ever showered 
 Scrub behind ya ears, shed the final tears 
 Remember what the world was like in the final years 
 Just a speck of dirt in the universe, snap fingers 
 Just like that— assume the worst 
 Back in business, guzzle beers, track and fitness 
 Laps get faster, could've missed Christmas 
 What is this?[Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Intro] 
 Hey there boys and girls! 
 Let me know if y'all with me y'all 
  
 [Verse] 
 I only play the games that I win at 
 And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats 
 As a matter of fact, let me rephrase 
 With more rhymes than ways to fillet felines these days 
 Watch the path of the black one, Super-villain 
 Who wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor 
 Chillin, ready and willin' to inadvertantly foil that plan of the rhymers they be whiners like spoiled brats 
 Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose 
 And holds mics like he knows karate body blows 
 Nobody knows the trouble I see from the MPV 
 Fly dirty tailin' the bubble eye thirty 
 For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all 
 It's science fiction that's not permissible in no court of law 
 I live to rock mics in 3-D 
 The only reason i seek to stop, to snuff the TV 
 I heard beats, they sound like karaoke with monkey rhymers on a leash like "don't let this nigga choke me" 
 Hit 'em with a penny so we could get these peanuts 
 And I thought we was nuts 
 I used to get free cuts 
 They lock Lex Luthor up in Green Haven 
 Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven 
 Misbehavin' rap stars need Listament 
 Call me Mr. Bent, I'm at where your sister went, intelligent 
 Used to write and be well spoke 
 Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell- 
 Tell joke 
 This could lead to catastrophe 
 'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three shots from the black bat that got me at headlock 
 Holdin' on to sanity by strands of that dreadlock 
 She told me get off, I said "Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich" 
 Then this shit hit me like the point of intoxication 
 Imma come out and rock this nation 
 Like ox defacing 
 A lot niggas out is rusty like oxidation 
 In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation 
 I could do it 
 I'm the super like in your building 
 Villain like trife Kinder is in All My Children 
 Plottin', and it's sure to pay ends 
 With some real mature womens and some more of they friends 
 And when bad men roll tight 
 It's actual true, like a pack of big Bambu with natural glue 
 Who grip necks of deuce to dukes to triple X 
 He just came in 4-D, follow the ripple effects 
 And it'll lead ya right to him 
 Oh snap! 
 Seems we've walked into a trap through rap 
 Zoinks! This place is filled with pretender willies 
 One false move and get broke off like end of Phillies 
 Yes true believers 
 Ain't nothing new to a 
 Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uhhhhh... 
 I picture rhyme of the month, two page long 
 I'm in it with two gauges and my cape on wrong 
 Son it's on, it's like a Raekwon tape song 
 With a fleet of superbad bitches, status: Rae Dawn Chong 
 Let me know if y'all with me y'all (HEY!!!) 
 It's national and geographic, down to the titty ball 
 I represents MI City y'all 
 To my man Wiz doing his unsettling bids 
 You woulda got away if it was not for them meddling kids 
  
 M'er F'ersMF DOOM - “Doomsday (Mister Jason Remix)” 
 [Emcee(s): MF DOOM] 
 [Producer(s): Mister Jason] 
 [Scratches: Mister Jason] 
  
 [Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop 
 Hold mics like ponytails: tight and bob a lot 
 Stop, stick around, come through and dig the sound 
 Of the fly, brown, sickled, sicko psycho who throws his dick around 
 Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap 
 It’s an intricate plot of a b-boy strapped 
 Femstat cats get kidnapped, then release 
 A statement to the press, let the rest know who did that 
 Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility 
 Broken household name usually said in hostility 
 Um... what is MF?  You silly 
 I’d like to take “Mens to the End” for two milli’ 
 “Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!”  That’s an audio daily double 
 Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble. yo 
 Watch your own back.  Came in and go out alone, black 
 Stay in the zone, turn H2O to Cognac 
  
 [Hook: Samples with Scratches by Mister Jason] 
 “On Doomsday” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday” 
 “Operation: Doomsday” 
 “MF?  You silly” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday” 
 “Operation: Doomsday” 
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM] 
 I wrote this one in B.C.D.C. O-section 
 If you don’t believe me, go get bagged and check then 
 Cell number 17, up under the top bunk 
 I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk 
 Pop the trunk on C-Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped 
 God forbid, if ain’t no escape, blame MF tape 
 Definition: “Supervillain,” a killer who love children 
 One who is well-skilled in destruction as well as building 
 While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer 
 I’m trading science fiction with my man, the live lifer 
 A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime 
 Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime.  Get out 
 My face, asking ‘bout my case.  You need toothpaste 
 Refresher mint, monkey-style nigga the Dentadent 
 And dope fiends still in their teens, shook niggas turn 
 Witness, real mens mind their own business 
 That’s the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that’s 
 Double Dutch, how come I hold the microphone double-clutch 
 C.O.’s make rounds, never had ox found 
 On shakedown, lockdown, wet dreams of Fox’ Brown

 [Verse 3: MF DOOM] 
 Some M-er F-ers don’t like how Sally walk 
 I’ll tell y’all fools it’s hella cool how ladies from Cali talk 
 Never let it interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang 
 Nicknames off nibbling tip of nipple: Metal Fang 
 Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang, known amongst 
 Foes for flow without no talking orangutans 
 Only gin and Tang guzzled out a rusty tin 
 Can.  Me and this mic is like yin and yang 
 Clang!  Crime don’t pay.  Listen, youth 
 It’s like me holding up the line at the kissing booth 
 I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth 
 Spitting all out the sunroof through her missing tooth 
 But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce 
 So I turnt it up faster than a speeding knife 
 Strong enough to please a wife, able 
 To drop today’s math in the 48 keys of life 
 Cut the crap.  Far as rap, touch the mic 
 And get the same shit a Arab will do to you for stealing 
 What the Devil?  He on another level 
 It’s a word!  No, a name!  MF the Supervillain! 
  
 [Outro: MF DOOM] 
 Doomsday![Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental]The Green Hornet 
 [Instrumental][Intro] 
 I get no kick from champagne 
 Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all 
 So tell me why should it be true? 
 I get a kick out of brew 
  
 [Verse] 
 There's only one beer left 
 Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf 
 Tempt me, do a number on a label 
 Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table 
 "It's on me. Put it on my tab kid." 
 However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it 
 You're leavin on your face, forfeit 
 Of course the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it 
 Told her tell him they stole it - he told her he lost it 
 She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit 
 Gettin money, D's be gettin no new leads 
 It's like he eatin watermelon, spittin seed after seed 
 It's the bleed, give me some of what he's droopin off 
 Soon as he wake up, chokin like it was whoopin cough 
 They group been soft 
 First hour at the open bar and they're troopin off 
 He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road 
 She asked him autograph her derriere, read 
 “Too Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd 
 Love, Villain.” Take pride in code words 
 Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart 
 Probably still be speakin in rhymes as a old fart 
 Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy 
 No he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye 
 And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel 
 The same way she feel him when he flow with nerves of steel 
 They call the super when they need some back... uhh... plumbing fixed 
 "How it's only one left? The pack come in six! 
 Whatever happened to two and three?" 
 A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught 
 Like, "What you doing G? 
 Don't make him have to get cuttin like truancy 
 Matter fact, not for nothin, right now, you and me!" 
 Looser than a pair of Adidas 
 I hope you brought your spare tweeters 
 MC's sound like cheerleaders 
 Rappin and dancin like Redhead Kingpin 
 DOOM came do the thing again, no matter who be blingin' 
 He do it for the smelly hubbies 
 Seeds know what time is it like it's time for Tellie Tubbies 
 Few got it, even fewer can sell it 
 Take it from the man who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet 
 He plot shows like robberies 
 In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please 
 Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt 
 Mic the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Bring heat, like your boy done gone to war 
 He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!" 
 A whole string of jobs, like we on tour 
 Every night on the score, comin to your corner store[Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Verse 1 : Ghostface Killah] 
 Both hands clusty, chilling with my man Rusty 
 Low down, blew off the burner kinda dusty 
 The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host 
 Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro 
 Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and 
 Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in' 
 West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels 
 Turn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school 
 Inhale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel 
 Duracell knot, you flash a burnt cell 
 Snap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is 
 Blacks become immune and shit, we never did 
 Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs 
 Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar 
 Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land 
 You god damn right I fuck fans, king me 
 Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder 
 Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now 
  
 [Bridge] 
 When we hug these mics we get busy 
 Come and have a good time with G-O-D 
 Make you snap your fingers or wiggle 
 Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle 
 Shake that body, party that body 
 Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry 
 That's word, I'm not the herb 
 Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying 
  
 [Verse 2: Ghostface Killah] 
 Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert 
 Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful 
 Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter 
 Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us 
 We lay low glitter wax full bangles 
 Priceless ropes, lay around the God get tangled 
 Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass 
 Twelve men following me, it be the God staff 
 Move, every script's like Miramax 
 Smash the big boy, totalled it, Wilshire and Fairfax 
 Son beaming wifey on the beach, sipping Zima 
 Wu 'binos, to latinos, we love Selena 
 Overnight, God schedules, Fed-Ex 
 Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics 
 Too hot, to handle one thought from scrambling the mandolin 
 Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when 
 He rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts 
 Yo kid stop fronting on the ground 'fore you get touched 
 It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son 
 We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry 
  
 [Verse 3 : Cam'ron ] 
 Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daiquiris 
 Like it's all good down at the hit factory 
 Be on 54th, whole clique backing me 
 All that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery 
 I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet Uzis 
 And I can't act, turned down 3 movies 
 So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash 
 And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast 
 My rude ass, carries 3 weapons 
 And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping 
 Who else in a hurry to mirk 
 We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts 
 Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work (what?!) 
 I'd rather run the streets in a 730 with work 
 But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order 
 Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter 
 Y'Serious? This man can't be 
 Be glad I'm not in her damn panties 
 Got a damn handy 
 How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy 
 I'm going to sell to anybody in your damn family 
 Your Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy 
 Your right hand man Randy, understand me 
 In Atlanta I got an outlandish land piece and a matching land 
 Desert-colored: Sandy 
  
 [Hook] 
 You know the one with the whips, THATS ME 
 The one with the chips and the chips, THATS ME 
 The one with the toast, pants saggy, yelling out get at me 
 Get at me, nigga, THATS ME 
 The one that be running and dodging, YOU 
 The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU 
 The one that's scared of some yay yo 
 Always wanna lay low, cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch 
  
 [Verse 4 : Cam'ron ] 
 I could show you some ice 
 Throw you advice 
 You not that good dog, who told you you're nice 
 Ay, yo your crew, switch siders 
 When I come through, hey Cam 
 Dick riders 
 But I only mess with Navigators 528 
 6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver 
 Come through, stick your suppliers 
 Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva 
 Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth 
 Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out 
 And I don't got beef, I don't play those games 
 If I did though believe me I would say y'all names 
 Go to your house, red dot scope your crib 
 Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz 
 My crew split it was my mistake 
 But to my nigga Duke we all make mistakes 
 I'm going to get shit right if I spend my cake 
 Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5h 
 This is for my niggas that load the pipe 
 Saying I'm the best just not promoted right 
 You know my life 
 Drink, smoke, roll some dice 
 Control the hiest 
 Know I'm a patrol your schiest 
 We all get schiest[Produced by MF DOOM][Instrumental][Instrumental][DOOM] 
 Listerine green jars, sick cleans jalla be a emma 
 Thick queens, mamma mia robs jalapeno peppers 
 Click mean large, brick seen mirage is ours 
 Quick mean cause, strict deen Allah 
 Make your quota, check your clock shock taqwa 
 Concoct the potion, blue liner lotion, call it aqua 
 Tock you on watch, sure ahk, salaat two rak'at 
 Four to roll in extorter mode, loose spot too hot 
 Here you go ma, for you boo, that's coco mango 
 She let her hang go, her man said "yo no tango" 
 Bangles jangle, no gangs is tranquil 
 Blank grill, real shank steel, bankroll ankle 
 F to the N and R, two thiefs are bummin a car 
 But never had no beef so Alhamdulillah 
 Inshallah any duties, top grillers, no Mercedes sign 
 Bubble nuggets with the ruby, Cop Killer 89

 Marvelous orchestras summoned the forces of power that orbited us 
 Dune cloud smoked orifices, Sight endorses what is glorious 
 Relive the first feelin of euphoria, power is in all of us 
 Notoriety is notorious, words scatter prefer (????) 
 Bros mad with first data like a dagger, slice of minimal maestro 
 A little nice yo, well look at the price though 
 Smooth rules that ooze as few as complex chemistry 
 And bitch and use and fizz and use with rhythms of recipe 
 Lesser fuse the energy to increase equity 
 So cinematic thoughts create a beautiful entity, envelope telepathy 
 And freaks the format, chop your garbage into 4-track 
 Recorded more facts to a stack 
 Only pour the pure tour back later 
 Years ago I stopped checkin for anyone on a major 
 I smack a hater with a tractor trailer use a paper[Instrumental][Instrumental][Produced by MF DOOM]Mary, you make me wanna eat you 
 Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you 
 Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too 
 Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through 
 Like my genie in a bottle 
 Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model 
 Before you know it, he have her on a stroll 
 Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold 
 If I had to guess, just right, not a day old 
 Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load 
 Know the right number, you can get her 
 And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like 
 Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry 
 Just be cute and don't worry 
 Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it 
 Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it 
 I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter 
 Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her 
 She used to let me use her, back when I was looser 
 Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her 
 I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me 
 I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee 
 She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco 
 You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though 
 Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner 
 If caught I get mad time just for touchin her 
 Knock wood, so much for hymens 
 So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds 
 Little young thing, she likes to do the tounge thing 
 At times, she would play hard to get, grunting 
 Or something, she made me feel like the number one king 
 Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling 
 Met her at Central Park this one time 
 Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine 
 She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl 
 She fuckin wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl 
 We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me 
 She helped me get money at the dutch price OT 
 Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish 
 Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish 
 And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black 
 Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin pulled back 
 All she want me to do is blaze it crazy 
 The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy 
 Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi 
 Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me 
 It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on 
 Ally is always there to help me get back on[Produced by MF DOOM][Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Verse 1 : Erykah Badu] 
 Oh my my my I'm feeling high 
 My moneys gone, I'm all alone 
 The world keeps turning 
 Oh what a day, what a day, what a day 
 Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned 
 If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned 
 If we were made in his image then call us by our names 
 Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same 
  
 [Hook] 
 Oh on and on and on and on 
 My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone 
 On and on and on and on 
 All night till the break of dawn 
 I go on and on and on and on 
 My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone 
 Oh on and on and on and on 
 Goddammit I'mma sing my song 
  
 [Verse 2 : Erykah Badu] 
 I was born under water 
 With three dollars and six dimes 
 Yeah you might laugh cause you did not do your math 
 Like one, two, three 
 Damn, yall feel that 
 Like one, two, three 
 The world keeps turning 
 Oh what a day, what a day, what a day 
 The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all 
 Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall 
 If we were made in his image then call us by our names 
 Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same 
  
 [Verse 3 : Erykah Badu] 
 I am feeling kinda hungry cause my high is coming down 
 Don't feed me yours cause your food does not endure 
 I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning 
 Oh what a day, what a day what a day 
 You rush into destruction cause you don't have nothing left 
 The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon get left 
 If we were made in his image then call us by our names 
 Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same 
  
 [Chorus] 
 Oh on and on and on and on 
 My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone 
 On and on and on and on 
 All night till the break of dawn 
 I go on and on and on and on 
 My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone 
 On and on and on and on

 [Verse 1 : Jeru The Damaja] 
 Now, I don't push a Lex 
 Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next 
 All these so called players up in the rap game 
 Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine 
 It used to be LaToya and jim hats 
 But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks 
 Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow 
 But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello 
 Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo 
 Never received currency for moving a kilo 
 Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow 
 I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo 
 Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's 
 Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints 
 Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth 
 Tight case for the DA from here to down South 
 Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth 
 You're a player but only because you be playing yourself 
  
 [Hook 1] 
 With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself 
 With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself 
 With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself 
 You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself 
 With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself 
 With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself 
 With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself 
 You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself 
  
 [Verse 2 : Jeru the Damaja] 
 Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city 
 I refined a few I met, around the country 
 The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question 
 Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections 
 And sisters with good minds, get no respect when 
 Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section 
 Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab 
 I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft 
 Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted 
 Black women, make sure you're respected 
 When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know 
 From jump: "Dead it", you're not ignorant 
 Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth 
 Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself 
  
 [Hook 2] 
 With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself 
 With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself 
 Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself 
 You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself 
 Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself 
 With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself 
 With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself 
 You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself 
  
 [Verse 3 : Jeru the Damaja] 
 Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs 
 In the projects, or use mics to sell sex 
 Niggas, nowadays is all about this 
 So much ying yang, it's ridiculous 
 If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors 
 And these record companies shake em down like mobsters 
 But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas 
 Always faking moves, never, making moves 
 Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools 
 You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels 
 And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals 
 Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised 
 On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet 
 The race is on, but I won't compete[Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [ Verse 1 : Lil' Fame ] 
 Why y'all niggas is sis' to fuck with Lil' Fame 
 I analyze the streets, spit real game 
 I'll blast on you as you pass on through 
 Catch you right where you stand put your ass on you 
 I remind niggas with that blue steel that you rip 
 And the rush that you felt from the nigga that you hit, now 
 How many niggas wanna ride with me, collide with me 
 Be accesoires to homicide with me [ First Family! ] 
 Who I hang with, bang with, spit flames with 
 The hand full of niggas that I came with 
 I ain't tripping, I know you got a hell of a plan 
 For the man if you ever caught me slipping 
 You will stop me, won't you, pop me, won't you 
 But you know I'll whoop ya motherfucking ass bitch, don't you 
 My family strong, your mams don't need so stop breathing' 
 Before you cats and you ass get deleted 
  
 [ Chorus 2x] 
 Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here 
 You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year 
 Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!) 
 We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga 
  
 [Verse 2 : Billy Danze ] 
 Stand up faggot, I'll let you have it where you post at 
 (William Berckowicz!) Back with my golden fiend and Womack 
 (BLAOW!) Nigga hold that, Juliani can't control that 
 (We buss outta clutches on Magnum triggers) He know that 
 With the same cats that blaze DAT's on the boulevard 
 We remain strapped, then came back, doin' it hard 
 So send your soldiers cobra and I will send everyone of 'em back 
 With holes under they' hat, falls of through they' back 
 Damn with it motherfucker (BK!) All day real with it motherfucker 
 I'm not your average, I'm from a block where they trap cops 
 And made 'em holler ten-thirteen 
 It's the commander, Danze, hands, down 
 You need to know who you fucking with now 
 Now kill-a-kill again, with an unusual will to win 
 An unusual will to sin, stop fucking with me 
  
 [ Chorus 2x] 
 Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here 
 You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year 
 Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!) 
 We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga 
  
  
 [ Verse 3 : Lil' Fame ] 
 It's an every day thing in a every day game 
 More day every day, motherfucker bang (BANG!) 
 It's the streets in me, and me, I'm staying tuned to this shit 
 It's music to my ears, I'm immune to this shit 
 I'm suffering, from a disease called 'Leave me the fuck alone' 
 In this full blown (blown), bitch 
 M.O.P., prepare for the ruckus 
 And we murder-murder-ma-murder-murder you motherfuckers 
  
 [ Verse 4 : Billy Danze ] 
 Allow me the way out, down out, pull my gun out 
 Run out in the middle of a street light (Bum, bum bum) 
 Ah, there you go, bastard, murder international, custom main caskets 
 Now could any of you cocksuckers turn to me 
 The way this streetgame is going is concerning me 
 Whatever happened to the old days 
 We all blaze, we all study criminal ways 
  
 [ Chorus 2x] 
 Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here 
 You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year 
 Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!) 
 We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga[Intro] 
 SWAMPMAHN in this bitch 
 You know how we coming 
  
 [Verse: SWAMP MAHN] 
 Coming out the swamp 
 Still hating saying so many things 
 Oh my gosh 
 In this doing me 
 Balling like Chris Bosh 
 Wondering 
 I don't even know 
 What to say 
 Cause it's off the dome 
 Oh gosh 
 Everyone saying mad shit 
 I'm still saying 
 Can't you take a hint 
 I really don't give a fuck 
 And you still mustering 
 I'm still mysterious 
 Oh gosh 
 And you eating 
 Everything with sauce 
 Cuz I'm just taking it 
 Cause you just mad 
 How I'm coming 
 Like I'm not even trying 
 Maybe morgue 
 Oh shit 
 Yea I know I'm busting into 
 Yo motherfucking mental 
 You can't even understand 
 What I'm even saying? 
 I'm just going BAAAM 
 Oh my gosh 
 Cause I'm so plain 
 So bland 
 Oh shit 
 My head is blank 
 When you see my face 
 But slipt on the mic 
 It's just on another case 
 But 
 Let me break out this cage 
 You feel me 
 Just quit hating 
 Just quit hating on SWAMPMAHN 
 I'm up next 
  
 [Verse: A-F-R-O] 
 The chapter of the saga, fast narration, causin' 
 Track elevation horror slash meditation noggin 
 The martyr danced on, the father lost the ransom 
 For his mom and handsome son, shot a random thug 
 Slugs in the Kevlar, gun fun 
 Settle on the fund from the lust, trust shunned, slums bare arms 
 The poorest village mourn the form of its children 
 The norm was timid, scornin' orange trimmings for a livin' 
 Don't underestimate the child with revenge 
 In his eyes, he repents on the lives that he sends 
 To the sky, in defense, he relies in the lens 
 Tried twice by the feds, shied right from the pen 
 Nine times he extends lines, writing with a pencil 
 Mental reading, leaving heathens bleeding like a menstrual 
 Even Stevens, grew up in evening gutter sewers 
 Nothin' newer, somethin' functioned crueler, eating guts and stomach ulcers 
 All he needed was to look up to someone older 
 A role model, cold, hollow, non-sensical 
 Cold followed, slo-mo goblin showin' off 
 To Shaolin showmen, silence, throw 'em in a bottle 
 Poem-wrote boss 
  
 The final battle lured the ripped child and his daddy 
 Blind samurai, sword lie straight gripped in his hands, see 
 Shot hollows at his feet, and yelled, "dance" 
 Failed as a male dad, pale, stale, jail, well-advanced 
 He consents all the pain in the village 
 'Til the strangest scent of anger swayed, tempting the children 
 To gather all weapons, fathom all sections 
 On camera, caught pictures of the family, all massacred 
  
 [Verse: Earl Sweatshirt] 
 More than feelings get hurt when the shotty goes 
 Blow, ears get fucked from my audios 
 I get more ass than potty holes 
 Had these naughty flows ever since I was a snotty nose 
 Youngin, mobbin’ with my shirt tucked in 
 I’ll pop a nigga in his mouth to show him I wasn’t bluffin’ 
 But, things changed like a Barack Campaign ad 
 Niggas on the sneak tip I see you clearly through these Ray-Bans 
 Wait, now my erections go "pshh" down the necks of hoes 
 Who next to go? The flexible bisexual, I’m thinkin’ so 
 What’s perplexin’, though, is that this adolescent's flow 
 Is hotter than a motherfuckin’ summer spent in Mexico 
 Cop me a mic, check and go, prepare for domination 
 I got more flavors than a calm doctor has patients 
 Cut to the race, I’ll come in first place 
 Respect me or catch a Nike SB to the face 
 Now, I whooped so many niggas that they callin’ me racist 
 I annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is 
 Ask them motherfuckers locked up in my basement 
 I won’t give a shit, fuck, once your face hit’s the pavement 
 A hater only flatters me 
 Who's up to bat? We bastards, we savage, y'all handle more balls than Agassi 
 No body passes me, Fantastic 3 plus 1 
 Leave catastrophes wherever we run, umm 
 Hun, pardon the casualties 
 Lyrically you can’t pass me 
 Nigga tryina pass me got slapped like a black chicks ass cheek 
 I’m cold make the track sneeze, breakin’ niggas like bad knees 
 I got sweet steeze, so sweet I attract bees 
 With my, brainiac flows, the zaniest hoes know 
 I hit niggas playin’ me with low blows 
 To keep your eyes wide shut like a No-Doz 
 I cop dough and stay afloat when I show boat, nigga 
  
 [Verse: MF DOOM] 
 So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty 
 Having me, then he told the people "You can call me, Your Majesty!" 
 Keep your battery charged, you know it won't 
 Stick yo, and it's not his fault you kick slow 
 Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow 
 Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go 
 And you know I know that's a bunch of snow 
 The beat is so butter, Peep the slow cutter 
 As he utter the calm flow ("Your mother—"), don't talk about my moms, yo 
 Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow 
 Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie 
 Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy 
 Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses 
 Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses 
 And he won't stop 'til he got the masses 
 And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses 
 Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo 
 Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo 
 It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame 
 Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name 
  
 [Verse: Capital STEEZ] 
 S is for the stamina, T is for the talent 
 And then two E so you don't forget the name Excalibur 
 Z's the Zip Zinger board that I'm passing you on 
 You still hoping that I pass the baton 
 But, I hope you got your cameras on 
 Plus ain't no passenger surviving when the damage is done 
 All you cats can fine your damages I'm smashin' the song 
 Plus your shit is outdated like the calendar's wrong, boy 
 So fall back, it's all caps, record that 
 Or you can get your jaw cracked and stomped like floor mats 
 Plus we're right outside your crib, doormats 
 With two niggas holding on the back, bra strap 
 Plus they got the big bangers call it bra strap 
 And leave your melon leaking like breastfeeding 
 She said she tempted but she won't let me caress the cleavage 
 It's the Khan bitch, why you need a better reason? 
 Class clown, found it funny to correct my teachers 
 I stand proud, but I never said my pledge allegiance 
 I'm a veteran, flowing way colder than the seven seas 
 Of course you be subjected to these heavy breezes 
 Or check the tag miss, straight STEEZ varsity jacket 
 Setting me apart from the average 
 Cause I'm a motherfucking star, asterisk 
 Fuck friends, I'm in it for the dollars like mavericks 
 Get paid, get queued, get away 
 Dashin, take 14th to Manhattan 
 Skip fashion, I'm still a chick magnet 
 For women with assets that's thicker than they accents 
 She say she got her man on a leash 
 Wear the pants in the relationship with panties beneath 
 So I proceed to ask if she can stand on her knees 
 You already know my capital, Capital STEEZ 
  
 [Outro] 
 No, that was too much man 
 There's some fucking clichés man 
 Why can't I be just like the other rappers and just fucking rap? 
 Why I always got to like overdo this shit man?[Instrumental][Produced by MF DOOM] 
  
 [Verse 1 : Big Punisher] 
 Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line 
 And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine 
 The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long 
 Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone 
 I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast 
 Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass 
 And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist' 
 All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit 
 Lace the click, cause we all share 
 It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair 
 Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run 
 Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum 
 Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl 
 I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Segall 
 Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket 
 That's it (that's it?) That's it 
  
 [Verse 2 : Cuban Link] 
 Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit 
 Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate 
 Up in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar 
 Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin cigars, livin large 
 We rob and steal, run with the mob, doin jobs for bills 
 I'm hard to kill for real nigga guard your grill 
 I like to chill, spark an L and get high 
 I'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly 
  
 [Verse 3 : JuJu] 
 Whattup Duke-o, you know, politickin papi chuco 
 I'm out here, watching for Jake, getting this loot though 
 Shoot bro, I got a waterproof suit yo 
 Swervin like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo 
 Squeezin, out of automatic M3's and 
 Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these 
 I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe 
 In Corona yo it's better to take than to receive 
  
 [Verse 4 : Psycho Les] 
 Your career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug 
 And have every thug shootin that Beatnut drug 
 In they blood, no escapin this 
 Niggas is goin over their favorite shit (for what?) to be tapin this 
 World premier, loud and clear 
 La and beer, get the dough, blow up the show 
 Dissapear, jump in the Cavalier 
 Feelin marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles 
 For pleasure, bring your territory terror 
 Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin "FUCK LESTER" 
 But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold 
 Don't give a fuck where you been what you done 
 Where you go, you know, peep this statement 
 In black shades like a secret, agent 
 We're night thieves, roll up on you like sleeves 
 We light trees, bust these and stack cheese 
  
 [Chorus 2x] 
 It's off the hook this year 
 Makin mad money off the books this year, ain't nothin 
 But crooks in here 
 Gettin mad money off the books this year 
  
 [Verse 5 : Guru] 
 Brothers are amused by others brother's reps 
 But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept 
 Cause in the night you'll feel fright 
 And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might 
 Wanna do a dance or two 
 Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew 
 No matter if you or your brother's a star 
 He could pop you and jet without a getaway car 
 And some might say that he's a dummy 
 But he's sticking you and taking all of your money 
 It's a daily operation 
 He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station 
 Mad brothers know his name 
 So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game 
 And while we're blaming society 
 He's at a party with his man 
 They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing 
 It looks big but they ain't staring 
 Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother 
 They'll be long gone before the kid recovers 
 And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck 
 Claiming respect, just to get a rep[Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Intro] 
 "DOOM mumbling and singing" 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight 
 But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white 
 The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it 
 To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick 
 When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick 
 At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you 
 Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper 
 Called back my secretary gatekeeper 
 Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though" 
 You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I had this style ever since I was a child 
 I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes 
 Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance 
 Emcees their styles need Velamints 
 And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements 
 On 99 plus one of them 
 Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him 
 When we with y'all, we had tons of fun 
 Me and my duns and them 
 Actual true and living sons of them 
 Dead planets and God-U 
 Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you 
 And won't feel remorse for shit 
 Except for once (?) and lost them shits 
 Scientific going berserk like Red Alert 
 I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt 
 To fund these experiments is where I went 
 Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent 
 To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do 
 Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?) 
 Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions 
 From niggas with fly names and I.D. questions 
 That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible 
 Them's not ready yet for the incredible 
 Team of MC's who broke all fakes 
 Who thought they were slaughter proof 
 Stomping through like North Face waterproof 
  
 [Outro] 
 Tat-tat, that's the end of that 
 After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at 
 I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of 
 Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...[Instrumental][Instrumental][Verse 1: Trunks] 
  
 Last Will and Testament, first Fallen Angel 
 Kicked out of Heaven, fell at a weird angle 
 Hit the ground running; scarred, tail tangled 
 Now he just raises the bar and leaves 'em mangled 
  
 So yeah motherfucker 
 I got the drive of a redneck trucker 
 Tractor pull, act a fool 
 We'll see who's backing you 
 Once we see what these cats'll do 
  
 It's like panthro, liono, and tiger in a thunder tank 
 Fuck where you from, I'm claiming anywhere you ain't 
 Take anything you can't, now ain't that something? 
 Tie a rope around the neck of the beat, and get it jumping 
  
  
 [Verse 2: MF DOOM][Instrumental][MF Doom] 
 Yo, yo 
 Bring in the big guns, weapons is ready 
 In the square shoot the heady reppin the yeti is ready 
 Bout time last train from Gun Hill, Dunn chill 
 Stay filled with exhiliration from one kill 
  
 [Scott Free] 
 Yo, rock for ? row don't tempt me 
 Smack the drum black, black rap Jack Dempsey 
 You get laced without a trace just for takin up space 
 Bill Bill the bombville you still catch a Gas Face 
 For real[Instrumental]"Yeah, here we go...just go with the flow" (repeats 4 times) 
  
 Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick 
 Microphone check 2,2,1,2,1,2 
  
 [Verse 1] 
 Big up all the Monsta Island massive 
 And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid 
 Who ask me what we don't got that you got son 
 For one, flow that's elementary my dear Wat-son 
 Secondly, ever since I was little 
 Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable 
 Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap 
 With no hands, I chop these drums off 
 Truly yours, G Rap 
 Actual fact, relax 
 In this land of lyrical loss, black 
 I'm not the cool sleet stack 
 The one who might stop and talk to you 
 Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to 
 Oooh...what you got to lose? Let mud fly 
 When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry 
 So I ask why the style's from the cess 
 Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest 
 The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand 
 Throwin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan 
 It ain't no use in tryin, man 
 Son, stop cryin 
 Frontin' like you death-defyin' 
 You need to stop lyin' 
 Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first 
 Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you 
 With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor 
 Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator 
 Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?) 
 Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown 
 (Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?) 
 And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up 
 (True, true) 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 I'd like to say hi 
 It's {?} fly the odd Merlin 
 That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling 
 {?} bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling 
 Who see God ?, never see God earlin' 
 My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost 
 Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most 
 With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast 
 Back to you MF Doom, you late show host 
 S to the U to the P E R-uh 
 Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror 
 {?} co-star or in a realer drama 
 Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower 
 Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes 
 Single-handedly with one eye closed 
 In a fly pose, no shirt {?} 
 May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay 
 That's in a smash way how he did it 
 Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute[Instrumental][Verse 1] 
 Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and 
 Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand 
 Tillin' the wasteland sands 
 Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan 
 He rest when he's ashes 
 Ask 'em after ten miles in his ga-lashes, smashes stashes 
 Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster 
 A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster 
 They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow 
 Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible 
 Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess 
 The ten case of cave a chicken chest S 
 Yes ya'll the dub will get ya trickles 
 The best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels 
 But tut tut, he about to change the price again 
 It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen 
 Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear 
 And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire 
 Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama 
 Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma 
 Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke 
 Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke 
 I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate" 
 He find out later when he tries to go and rep it 
 Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah 
 Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta 
 One monkey don't stop no slaughter 
 A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border 
 Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill 
 Flow skill, still there's no thrill 
 Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla 
 Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with— 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 —Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix 
 Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick 
 Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic 
 Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick 
 Sick slick, hidden in a book 
 The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook 
 Listen, don't look now, keep walkin' 
 Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin' 
 Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often 
 Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then 
 He's like Worf, some say stronger though 
 Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro 
 Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show 
 Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro 
 For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow 
 Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo 
 He's playin' Ray J the old tape 
 DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape 
 Fill it to the rim like brim 
 Villain and ya won't find him in no gym 
 Probably a foggy bog with the frogs 
 With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log 
 Half cocked and half baked 
 Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake 
 My mistake, sign a track agreement 
 For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement 
 In any event it's fake like wrestlin' 
 Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines 
 Ahem, elixir for the dry throat 
 Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote 
 By remote, send in the meat wagon 
 Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin' 
 These stats are staggerin' 
 Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin' 
 Villain, his agenda is clear 
 Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here 
 It's not meant for the seein' 
 Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein' 
 A new meanin' to sales through the roof 
 Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof 
 It's the return of the tramp 
 Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp 
 For the right earn - na'mean like Vern 
 We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn 
 Jiminy crickets 
 He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off SimplyLyrics 
 One man's waste is another man's soap 
 Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope 
 A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow 
 And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow 
 He wears a mask so the charge won't grab 
 On a rooftop with a large stone slab 
 Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish 
 Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish 
 Black licorice and equally as yucky 
 How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie 
 Monkey hustle, man on fire 
 Later for the date than the Hadron Collider 
 And cost more, it be seemin' like a style 
 DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile 
 Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels 
 In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules 
 Fools, the roach was never dead 
 Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head 
 Instead it was depicted as flicked in 
 Split, the wicks litIt's that butter shit niggas know I always never stutter with 
 Check the styles, check it, uh, peep it 
  
 [Verse 1] 
  
 I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys 
 Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop) 
 Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers 
 And cut halves through them gangsters, too 
 In real life, the real trife scene 
 Might steal your life with the assault machine 
 Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight 
 Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight 
 X, the unemotional, call me anti-social 
 On the run from off the gun death tally commercial 
 Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets 
 To my peeps, ??? beats 
 Like the weapons of war 
 Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door 
 Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours 
 My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls 
 The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills 
 Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians 
 Don't make me have to hurt them feelings 
 I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings 
 Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin' 
 Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home 
 Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin' 
 I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen 
  
 Bitch, nigga, switch the style 
 X a massive-versatile 
 Big up to Monster Isle 
  
 I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls 
 Peep it 
  
 [Verse 2] 
 To my brother Subroc and Black Ju 
 I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up 
 I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels 
 When giving crews a brush with death like between meals 
 Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose 
 With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose 
 X the suspicious flirter 
 That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder 
 A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes 
 The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle 
 Any given summer's eve don't breathe 
 Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve 
 Master of the O to predict ya last pause 
 I told you, Hell and gas drawls, breakin' 
 Glass and plastic jaws like federal drastic laws 
 Fed up from fightin' secret wars with them Fantastic Fours (invisible bitch) 
 Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state 
 The ho better settle case 
 The flow is at pedal pace - steady like tricycles 
 Beware all suckers is froze like icicles 
 I'm baggin' bitches like nickels 
 Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though 
 I'ma split till I pronounce, more hits than a ounce no doubt 
 About to bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out 
  
 [Outro] 
 And I like to give a shout to my man Jet Jaguar 
 You know, D-Smooth, ??? One 
 Master of the O 
 I call this joint 
 In hell with them Gas DrawlsDelete this[Instrumental][Instrumental]MF DOOM ft. King Geedorah, Jet Jaguar, and Rodan - “No Snakes Alive (MF EP Version)” 
 [Emcee(s): King Geedorah, Jet Jaguar, and Rodan] 
 [Producer(s): MF DOOM (Original Instrumental from Metal Fingers - “Star Anis”)] 
  
 [Verse 1: King Geedorah] 
 Geedorah has arrived, you guys could take five 
 By the time it’s over, no snakes alive 
 Take the dive, I’m telling you, you’re better off 
 Then up against the flow that make her take her sweater off 
 From the setoff, when it came to scripts, he could hardly brag 
 It’s the result of concentration and lollygag 
 I said, “Yeah right.”  He pulled a mic out a snotty rag 
 Was sealed up air-tight, and tied up in a body bag 
 Get an advance and catch chance writer’s block.  After 
 Spending the first and last penny, my own worst enemy 
 Tell me if I’m OD’ing.  Use a flow 
 And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so 
 The Three-Headed set it, never get busted 
 He’s a man of his word who’s yet to be trusted 
 Beats encrypted, multi-faceted, encrusted 
 Sweaty palm, keep mic rusted 
 Sort of mellow type of fellow 
 Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello 
 Hell no.  He only works like Illuminati 
 Or Gotti.  All shotty, he might use karate 
 Azar the Gaza caught cut, I’ll ask why 
 A mask with the ball-style caps saying, “That’s fly” 
 Exact dough ‘til it stack high 
 The white hoes, black guys, the rap game’s black eye 
  
 [Verse 2: Jet Jaguar] 
 Exhilaration, Jet Jag’s accelerations 
 Touch speeds minds can’t conceive 
 Achieve altered altitudes and angles, angels answer 
 Aura, illumination, awesome interpretation 
 Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest 
 Who’s best?  Monster Island Czars 
 Crush pawn dreams to be king 
 A frank reality, calculation could never be 
 Quest destined, distant competition dusted 
 Disgusted, race for second, crowded, clouded 
 Confusion, conclusion: simple, plain 
 Self-education, self-made millionaires 
 Serpents slithering, sidewinds searching 
 Stalking, heat-sensing, can’t have me 
 Jet Jag’s Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, superhero 
 Hit zero to sixty, hot pursuit, pedal to 
 The floor, handling 
 Lyrics, traction 
 Swerving left, right 
 Making head-fakes 
 Playing high stakes 
 Levitates 
 Quick!  Hit breaks, they fly past, hit wall, parts 
 Fly loose, killer mongoose 
  
 [Verse 3: Rodan] 
 Fake niggas continue to practice the art of intimidation 
 Sterile minds conceive thought for artificial insemination 
 Syntax the sequence, arranging lessons so deliberate, making 
 Wise words clear, but population stay illiterate 
 Consider it.  Gods define power, fools get rid of it, men build 
 Dreams on promises but lacking the will to deliver it 
 Yo, I dissolve connivers like saliva on tic-tacs gone 
 Astray, but get the job done like socks that’s mismatched 
 Flip tracks, murder snakes, drunk niggas killing six packs 
 Choking on venom, suffering tricknological kickbacks 
 Poverty-stricken minds with thoughts barely worth two cents 
 Build history through time, linear design on blueprints 
 A nuisance lies in disguise, Eighty-Five Percent never knew 
 Wise men arise, pull files like Internal Revenue 
 Forever true, opposing self-evidence with leverage 
 Upset the beast belly, concoct homogenized beverage 
 Clever shit, calculated sabotage, Trojan Horse 
 Giftwrapped ambush, we put energy in motion that grows in force 
 Chosen swords strategically aligned throughout the underworld 
 God of Elevation kill Superman, rape Wondergirl 
 Police character decapitated, fake beings susceptible 
 To everyday occurrence, a fatal outcome’s inevitable 
  
 [Verse 4: King Geedorah] 
 Might as well join the force 
 Boss.  Chance?  Take a loss like a coin-toss 
 Roll with a double-headed nickel 
 While the partner Jet Jag with the sickle, you in a pickle 
 King Geedorah, your ass needs to leave him alone 
 ‘Fore he cold-catch a seizure and then you’re blown 
 If he ain’t the best, he’s the best in 
 The top three out of myself, I, and me[Verse 1] 
 Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and 
 Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion [x2]

 A mask of haze. Struggling madly in a cage. Desperately 
 Searching for a way out of the maze. Running blindly not 
 Feeling the floor, nothing to stand on we fall. Lost in 
 The halls, I'm looking for the doors. Confusion! My 
 Senses are dying. My soul is crying. Let me out, let me 
 Out! I'm screaming! Running blindly through the visions 
 Barefoot and defenseless. Running blindly through the 
 Dark, infested woods. Time and time again. Disillusion 
 I'm deeper in the maze. Further from the light. I scream 
 Out of the confusion. I'm being consumed by confusion. My 
  
 World has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is 
 Fragments of doors. Though we once had but never had 
 We've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my 
 Soul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming 
 I'm living in a demented labyrinth. tortured. Lost 
 Crippled. I'm a part of this confusion. Shattered 
 Confusion. Shattered vision. All that I have left is 
 Illusion. I'm screaming at the confusion. I'm being 
 Consumed by confusion. In an abstract, in a world of 
 Confusion![Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental]Wrapped, Packaged

 As long as it's there

 Just gotta buy!

 We don't want to lead 
 Abiding by rules 
 Living on our knees[Instrumental][Instrumental][Verse 1: MF DOOM] 
 Big up all the Monsta Island massive 
 And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid 
 Who asked me what we don't got that you got son 
 For one flow that's elementary my dear Watson 
 Secondly, ever since I was little 
 Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable 
 Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap 
 With no hands, I chopped these drums off, truly yours, G Rap 
 Actual fact, relax 
 In this land of lyrical lost, black, I'm not the cool sleestak 
 The one who might stop and talk to you 
 Poisoned a few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork too 
 Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly 
 When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry 
 So I ask why the styes from the cess 
 Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest 
 The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand 
 Throwing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan 
 It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying 
 Fronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying 
 Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first 
 Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you 
 With well refined rhymes like a editor 
 Throw them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator 
 Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) was Jet Jaguar and James Brown 
 (yeah yeah, only them two) 
 Ain't you glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true) 
 I'd like to say, "Hi, it's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin" 
 That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling 
 Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling 
 Who see God toke but never see God hurlin' 
 My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost 
 Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most 
 With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose 
 Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host 
 S to the U to the P E R-uh 
 Who chronicle these times in a 3D horror 
 Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama 
 Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower 
 Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows 
 Single-handedly with one eye closed 
 In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé 
 May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay 
 That's that n a smash way how he did it 
 Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute 
 Exquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow 
 That's how we do it though[Instrumental]This might be a good time to replenish your napkin supply. Let us take a short break. Now relax. 
 Relax 
 What do you want? 
 (speaking Klingon) 
 I don't speak Klingon 
 (speaking Klingon) 
 No. Where is the bathroom? 
 Do you know anyone here? 
 No, I don't know anyone here. 
 Are you transporting Tribbles? 
 No, I'm not transporting Tribbles. 
 I'm a Terreth! Are you a Klingon? 
 Yes. What do you want? 
 (villian!) 
 (speaking Klingon) 
 (Well, thanks!) 
 Excuse me 
 (spitting noise) 
 What is your number, Terreth? 
 My eyes sting. Now I can smell something. Help! Get help quickly! 
 (crying) 
 To Terrens, this might seem a tackless way to begin a conversation, but among Klingons, it's considered quite civil. 
 Stop relaxing!

 Want you to call me at that address, if I'm still there, then I'll make sure you get the crack 
 Doom has taken over every continent! Meanwhile, back in space, Doom continues to search for colleagues 
 And your name? 
 Khan is my name. Khan, nothing else. Khan 
 As the funky beat continues, a rock steady 
 We have got to try to find Doom! 
 Good luck! 
 Time to get the feta![Instrumental][Instrumental][Instrumental]Tracks performed in act 2:

 Doomsday 
 Hey! 
 Rhymes Like Dimes 
 Change The Beat 
 The Fine Print[Instrumental]

shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this\nGotta be somethin' for me to write this\nQueen, I ain't seen you in a minute\nWrote this letter, and finally decide to send it\nSigned, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together\nLove has no limit, let's spend it slow forever\nI know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you\nI ain't gon' assault them, \u2018cause I probably did it too\nBecause of you, feelings I handle with care\nSome niggas recognize the light\nBut they can't handle the glare\nYou know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts\nIf relationship is effort I will match your work\nI want to be the one to make you happiest\nAnd hurt you the most\nThey say the end is near, it's important that we close\nTo the most high\nRegardless of what happen, on Him let's rely\n\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's important we communicate\nAnd tune the fate of this union to the right pitch\nI never call you my bitch or even my boo\nThere's so much in a name and so much more in you\nFew understand the union of woman and man\nAnd sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land\nBut that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write\nFor in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light\nIf Heaven had a height, you would be that tall\nGhetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all\nLet's stick to understandin' and we won't fall\nFor better or worse times, I hope to me you call\nSo I pray every day more than anything\nFriends we'll stay as we begin to lay\nThis foundation for a family, love ain't simple\nWhy can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?\nGranted we known each other for some time\nIt don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine\n\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Verse

rhyme to\nAt times when I'm lost I try to find you\nYou know to give me space when it's time to\nMy heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness\nTruthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence\nThe time we committed love, it was real good\nHad to be for me to arrive and it still feel good\nI know the sex ain't gon' keep you\nBut as my equal, it's how I must treat you\nAs my reflection in light I'ma lead you\nAnd whatever's right I'ma feed you\nDigga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da\nYo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!\n\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Outro]\nI'll take my chances\nBefore they pass\nPass me by, oh, darling\nYou need to look at the

see\nOl' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties\nShe didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick\nDid a couple of videos and became Afrocentric\nOut goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions\nShe was on that tip about stoppin' the violence\nAbout my people she was teachin' me\nBy not preachin' to me but speakin' to me\nIn a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach\nShe dug my rap, that's how we got close\nBut then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool\nCause around the same time, I went away to school\nAnd I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?\nShe probably get her money in L.A\nAnd she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul\nShe said that the pro-black was goin' out of style\nShe said, \"Afrocentricity was of the past\"\nSo she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz\nNow black music is black music and it's all good\nI wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood\nCause that was good for her, she was

he altered her native\nTold her if she got an image and a gimmick\nThat she could make money, and she did it like a dummy\nNow I see her in commercials, she's universal\nShe used to only swing it with the inner-city circle\nNow she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie\nAnd on some dumb shit when she comes to the city\nTalkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches\nNow she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches\nAlways smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk\nTellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk\nStressin' how hardcore and real she is\nShe was really the realest, before she got into showbiz\nI did her, not just to say that I did it\nBut I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it\nThat she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her\nI see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer\nBut I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop\n\u2018Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop\n\n[Chorus]\nTo the

deferred\nDark spots in my mind where the scene occured\nSome say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep\nThrough me, Muhammad will forever speak\nGreet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes\nWhere a man is determined by how much a man make\nCop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats\nWith cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear\nUnder the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped\nWant to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap\nRan so far from the streets that you can't come back\nYou tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that\n\n[Chorus]\n\"This is rap for real,

fight, fuck, or dream to it\nMy life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it\nThrough my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions\nMore than money saved, I wanna save children\nDealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity\nA complex man drawn off of simplicity\nReality is frisking me\nThis industry will make you lose intensity\nThe

I to judge one's perspective?\nThough some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating\nIf I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating\nI just want to innovate and stimulate minds\nTravel the world and penetrate the times\nEscape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom\nRaps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em\nFor now I appreciate this moment in

Who knows?\nAnyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves\nSo bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nYo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn\nBegan, began with time\nBeing my bloodline is one with the divine\nIn time brother, you will discover the light\nSome say that God is Black and the devil's White\nWell, the devil is wrong and God is what's right\nI fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear\nThe rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear\nAs a child, given religion with no answer to why\nJust told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die\nCuriosity killed the catechism\nUnderstanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to\nAnd became a slave to master self\nA rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health\nMy mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons\nQur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital\nAnd got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys\nYou just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief\nBut one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em\nAnd use religion as an emblem\nWhen it should be a natural way of life\nWho am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right\nThat's who got you doing right and got you this far\nWhether you say \"in Jesus name\" or \"Hum do Allah\"\nLong as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you\nYou let that show towards others in the things you do\n'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get it, baby\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me\n\n[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]\nLet me voice my concern\nSo many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn\nOur ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence\nSubconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince\nI've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place\n'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place\nSo I try to find the clue in you\nBut evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do\nWhy're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden\nDamn, something in me wanna know who I am\nSo I began my search, my journey started in church\nIt gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief\nHustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets\nTaught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with\nAnd I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school\nIt almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal\nTakin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran\nSearched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites\nHold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White\nSome leads were granted with insight\nAnd it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand\nHe still created with the imperfection of man\nSo, with following I disagree\nBy no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but\nI do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind\nThat's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas\nYou gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity\nBut one side you gonna have to choose\nAny chance to speak I refuse to misuse\nSo how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession\nBecome an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson\nIf a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\n\n[Hook]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me",

up half the night\nAmongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising\nDeveloping his knack to write\nNever leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself\nWhat he loved on the outside world, detached himself\nYou know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system\nHe drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions\nThis picture proved to be bigger than Black and White\nA young soul named Lesra

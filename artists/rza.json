I met Paul on the set of the film Brick Mansion, where we talked, laughed, and exchanged ideas of life and fatherhood. I only knew him personally for less than a year, but we knew each other through our work and art. We saw in each other a kindred spirit of men coming from unlikely circumstances, and rising to be the light and beacon of our family and loved ones. Men who learned the joy and pains of love in life, and success, while coming to realize that nothing is more important than family, friendship, and the brotherhood of humanity. Millions of people get to know an artist or movie star through their work, but few are allowed to cross each others' paths and see through the veil of stardom and find the common denominator that we share. As all physical things will decay and wither away, film, art, and music remain longer than the vessel that delivered them. In this vein, the one thing we can't take away or give back is time. So, thus, time is the most precious gift. I dedicated my time to compose this song with my two sons and new friend Will Wells, who was kind enough to sing and perform it for me. We dedicate it to Paul Walker. A good man. We had plans to continue working with each other in the future. It seemed destined, but \"destiny bends\".\n\n*Note* This song is not for criticism, it's just a sketch demo.

All digital? Any analog instruments? Vinyl sampling?   - What DAW do you prefer?\n-Do you make beats, then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together?\n- Do you have a specific process for finding samples, or is it all gut feeling?\n\nRZA - Well, that's a lot, but: not being egotistic about this, but I have a dozen set ups. And my home studio I use different rooms for setups. So one room is just turntables and a sampler, another would be just keyboards, another will be a digital room, there's one room where everything is analog (live drums, guitars, etc). As a composer, you always need different sounds, so after working with Hans Zimmer, I've learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes\n\nI prefer writing songs together. In fact one of the problems with making a Wu-Tang album is my refusal to send beats, because I believe that great music is created when people are in a room together\n\nI dig and I dig, and if something strikes my ear, I sample it. Then I twist it\n11. PEACE\nDo you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crab's hand with them?\n\nRZA - No. I gave them to my little brother and I think he lost em\n12. Do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment?\n\nRZA - Uh oh. It's getting deep on AMA. We said AMAA. But now that you asked, you better be aware of yourself and your partner(s)\n13. How did you like your time on Californication? Samurai Apocalypse was a great foil to Hank Moody\n\nRZA - It was very fun. Funny. And something was very sexy about that show. Maybe it was Meagan. LOL\n14. Hey RZA! Tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in Wu Tang: )\n\nRZA - Here's a story, it may not be funny depending on your point of view, but one time the whole Clan was in Atlanta, and I guess we caused some kind of riot in the building, and thus the police was brought in to end the show. I remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence, but one cop had got a grab of Inspector Deck and he couldn't get free. When we noticed it, me and Method Man rushed back over to help, but actually, what could we do? We can't hit a cop, could we? That would not have been wise. Instead, Method Man grabbed onto Inspector Deck's arm, and combined his strength with Inspector Deck, which allowed them to get away from the cop, they broke his grip and we all ran. I later told Meth \"That was some Wu-Tang Kung fu shit right there.\"\n15. How was working with Earl Sweatshirt? I've heard that during the making of Molasses, you spit a freestyle for three hours\n\nRZA - Yeah, we got zoned out that night. He's a cool cat. And I think he will be a great talent in hiphop\n16. Hey RZA, how did you become a vegetarian?\n\nRZA - I just snapped out of eating dead animals\n17. BONG BONG! Been a fan for 20+ years\n2 questions:\nWhats your all time favorite Martial Arts flick?\nWhat is your favorite ODB verse/line/metaphor/song?\n\nRZA - I'll tell you the 3 that inspired me the most. Shaolin versus Wu-Tang. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. And the Five Deadly Venoms\nFor ODB \"I be the answer to your why, the tear to your cry.\" It's off a song he did with Killer Priest\n18. Who's the best chess player in the Wu Tang Clan right now?\n\nRZA - Hahahahahahaha. All I can say is that I had the hiphop chess belt\n19. What was it about Gravediggaz, and the horrorcore genre in general, that appealed to you when it was first starting?\n\nRZA - At the time, being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares, I wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. I feel like the Gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. Hiphop could use a few more doses of it now\n20. Hey RZA! You seem to be a very calculated, meditative and, for lack of a better word, spiritual person. Was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way you've always been?\nPeace & thanks for the AMA\n\nRZA - Yes, certain events led me to this, which is hard for me to describe to this, which are hard to describe. But I can say that it was a growth process. Would you believe I was once obnoxious\n21. Can you share any memories of your tour with Rage Against the Machine?\n\nRZA - That was one of the highlights of my career. At the time, Wu-Tang had the #1 album in the country, and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. One of my best memories is when Zack broke his leg on tour, and needed a little energy during the New Jersey show, and I came out and rocked the stage with him. The rest of the Wu went home. :(\n22. Have you considered being on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast? I can't remember if it was a tweet or during his own AMA, but Rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest\n\nRZA - Yes, I would love to be on as a guest someday. I'll wait for the time for him to invite me\n23. Hey RZA! really glad you're doing this AMA. I read somewhere that you and John Frusciante have recorded a ton of material. I really liked FM. Any chance you two might release a full album in the future? That would be awesome\n\nRZA - here's a chance for that. If life permits\n24. actor in Brick Mansions. AMAA\nHey hey now, let's not forget the awesome performance in \"The Man with the Iron Fists!\"\nGood job man. How much fun is it being so versatile?\n\nRZA - It's very challenging. Because some of my friends are thinking I'm becoming a little schizo. Wow, the life of an artist\n25. I was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said \"protect your neck\" and I immediately thought of Wu-Tang and giggled to myself. What do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class?\nWould bring a whole new meaning to \"flow.\"\n\nRZA - LOL\n26. Many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. What would you say were the main reasons \"Wu-Tang Forever\" was made into a Double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album? Was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of \"All Eyez on Me\" or more that you wanted to get more music out?\n\nRZA - Actually, a double-album was part creative, and part business. If i can recall, we hadn't done an album as Wu-Tang Clan for four years. And so we wanted to give Steve Rifkin an abundant amount of material. But also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it, they said \"how about a double album?\"\n27. Prince Rakeem! Just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life (or at least my wallet) way back when\n12 years ago, I\u2019m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil. I\u2019m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people. I\u2019m 20 years old, young enough to think I\u2019m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. This is one of those \u201cfavelas\u201d that you hear about in the news. Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn\u2019t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn\u2019t belong. This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night\nWell, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we were, we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. At first, the decision seems like the right one. The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn\u2019t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we\u2019ve used in the past, but now that it\u2019s night I start to realize some things I hadn\u2019t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It\u2019s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my na\u00efve little friend knows we\u2019re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, \u201cPerdidos?\u201d and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask \u201cYou guys are Wu-Tang fans?\u201d The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks \u201cWhat do YOU know about Wu-Tang?\u201d I respond by telling him that I\u2019m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I\u2019m saying. After all, I\u2019m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn\u2019t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another\u2014names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles\u2014I\u2019m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they\u2019re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy\u2019s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew\nFrom that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don\u2019t know just how good of a thing that was\nEdit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are\nEdit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here\n\nRZA - Wow\nI always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother\n28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy\n\nRZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe\n29. Wu-Tang Forever!\nHow much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible\n\nRZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther\n30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you!\n\nRZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC\nChoosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process\nPete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West\nYes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones\n31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew?\n\nRZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again\n32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk?\n\nRZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude\n33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise?\n\nRZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads\n34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story? The legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of Wu-Tang solo albums\nDid this actually happen?\nDid you recreate any of the beats that you lost? If so, which ones?\n\nRZA - Yeah, I lost a lot of beats. In those days, I would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder, which held 80 disks per case. And I had the cases sectioned out with names of each Wu member, and beats that fit their styles. Those disks have not been recovered yet. I have some of them, but they won't play\n35. Hey RZA, Huge Fan here, I've been listening to you since I was 10. One question\nAre you not going to publically publish songs off the new WuTang albulm, or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer?\n\nRZA - The album, that's entitled A Better Tomorrow, if completed, will be available to the public. The album entitled Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made\n36. When was the last time you saw Paul Walker?\n\nRZA - The last time I saw Paul in the flesh was on the movie set. We had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. But destiny bends\n37. How awesome is it being a Robert?\n(Mine name is Robert)\n\nRZA - Super duper awesome\n38. How did you come up with the name RZA?\n\nRZA - In my neighborhood, my homies would call me the RZA RZA Ra. Because they said I was razor-sharp. Ra was my chosen name, short for Rakeem. When I decided to improve myself, I changed my name to Rakeem Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah. And RZA is like an acronym for that\n39. What's your favourite videogame?\n\nRZA - Nowadays? Well it's hard to say your favorite video game, but one game I've been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is Tekken. Actually, when Wu-Tang first started making money, me and Method Man came to Manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games, and we tried to buy a Tekken to bring home to our house. And they wouldn't sell it to us at that time. Method Man would up getting one though. I wound up getting a pinball machine. Anyway, Tekken\n40. You get a swimming pool but you can't fill it with water, what do you fill it with? Money is not a choice either\n\nRZA - Those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits\n41. Liquid Swords II when?\nBtw Liquid Swords is the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time\n\nRZA - I think GZA may be in the process of writing that now", "Bob N\u2019I": "[Intro: sample]\nBird flying high, you know how I feel\nSun in the sky, you know how I feel\nBreeze drifting by, you know how I feel\nIt's a new dawn, it's a new day\nIt's a new life for...\nBird flying high, you know how I feel\nSun in the sky, you know how I feel\nBreeze drifting by, you know how I feel\nIt's a new dawn, it's a new day\nIt's a new life for me\n\n[RZA]\nWho be the last man standin' when I cock back the cannon?

A perfect example is Night of the Living Dead. That movie and its sequels teach you about life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, Night of the Living Dead predicted the dawn of crack. If you lived in the hood in the '80s, you saw that movie come to life in the street. There's a reason Public Enemy titled that song \"Night of the Living Baseheads.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, Dawn of the Dead was the great metaphor for American society. The zombies were Americans, just walking through the mall, lost, trying to find excitement outside of themselves. They forgot that excitement is not buying a new TV; it's taking your shoes off and walking in the grass in your backyard. All those movies were really showing us ourselves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I first saw Night of the Living Dead, I was scared to death. But when I watched it again at age sixteen (when they were up to Day of the Dead), I'd gotten knowledge of myself, and could relate to what it was saying about America. The dead were alive but they were blind, deaf, and dumb. So to me, they were symbolic of black men in America.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dead in those movies are alive--that's just a description of physical matter, it's active--but they don't have life. Life comes when you have knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, when you can see for real, touch and feel for real, know for real. Then you are truly living.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, all the Of the Dead films work as metaphors for the Five Percent. The survivors are holdouts living among the mentally dead. And interestingly, they tend to be led by black men. At the same time, though, after the black man survives--he fights off destruction through the whole movie--a white man kills him.", "Unleash Me": "[RZA]\nYo, sting of the dragon master, one blow make your jaw shatter\nHave you walk around with your face wrapped in plaster\nGaspin'....... *gasp*, like you got a bad case of asthma\nSpot the dog, you try to run faster\nWild savage, but he bow down to his master\nWashed beef with an ice cold shaster, he would shout\n\n[Chorus: RZA]\nI am free from you, so unleash me\nThere's nothin' else you can do to teach me\nNothin' else you can do to appease me\nI know this point in life, it wouldn't be easy\nI gave you my all, I would eat food\nOut of cans, through my hands and all\nJust to show and prove, you my man's and all\nDidn't even try to make plans at all\n\n[Prodigal Sunn]\nMy hand's cut in the outer, leakin' the contender\nHit 'em high, stick 'em low, break through the center\nSomebody screamin' ambulance, yo, he bend a\nGhost like a ninja, whole 'nother agenda\nCatch me day and night, ready for fight\nPlus I spit more through the mic, four fist right\nChest, head, body blow, would leave, anything goes\nBroken nose, shatterin' jaws, spark him with the C-4\nP-Sunn did it from the east door\nThe more I tour, the more I score, watch the lion roar\nThrough the field, with the skills and agility\nMartial art ability, bend the laws of gravity\nStay in shape, no cavities\nSome wise words from a young one, trained to reach mastery\n\n[Chorus: RZA]\nI am free from you, so unleash me\nThere's nothin' else you can do to teach me\n\n[Christ Bearer]\nI am free from you, Buddhapest fist, Tai Chi, Kung Fu\nMaster siku, jujitsu, round house kick you\nForty elbows, then I left right hit you\nMaster set me free, although you'll never let me get the master key\nCause when it's time for beef, who could the master be\nWhile I'm stopped, critique you see the master flee\nBut cats keep rushin', I'll back flip bust you\nCrack your rib cage apart, snatch your heart, that's nothin'\nGuillotine chop, to the Phillipine hot\nLeave 'em worst, and sendin' them to Killa, get shot\nI ate from my hands, and ate from the plan\nEntranced, my face was a glance\nI gave you my all, I know you felt my slave to, and thought\nI'm sittin' fool on y'all\n\n[Chorus 2X]", "Digi Snacks Intro": "[Intro: Understanding (RZA)]\nExplosive mic Bobby trap rap books\nThe game isn't over, til the kings go wild\nA brilliant virtuous doctor, in the 21st century (hahahahahahaha)\nExperiments with a strange potion, called Digital Elixir (hahahahahahaha)\nThat transforms him, into a powerful being\nThat struggles with the great and evil within himself (hohohohohoho)\nWhile saving the lives of others\nAnother classic tale of the dangers and benefits of drugs (huh... he's back!\nAhh!)\n\n[RZA]\nYo, double dose of danger, it's the Gunfighter and the Stranger\nPeep the silver bullets, like the old Lone Ranger\nTransform on ya'll niggas, like the Werewolf from London\nMy cousin Dirty Dick Don, yeah he straight out the dungeon\nMan up in the art gall', my girl, my newborn child\nGod chosen, son, we just sip from the Nile\nGold plated dinner dishes, fresh slice of fresh papaya\nPulled by the scrolls, read the Book of Obadiah\nSmack ya head against the wall like a Spalding\nMy thugs, they carry more drugs than Walgreen's\nMr. Digital, bodododo, sometimes appear invisible\nGot this money, now my old bitch is miserable\nOld Jack Nicholson grin, I stay sinister\nTwo billion dollar advance, for a three letter signature\nHoly frankincense and myrrh...\n\n[Outro: Understanding]\nExplosive mic Bobby trap rap books\nThe game isn't over, til the kings go wild\nA brilliant virtuous doctor, in the 21st century\nExperiments with a strange potion, called Digital Elixir\nThat transforms him, into a powerful being\nThat struggles with the great and evil within himself\nWhile saving the lives of others\nAnother classic tale of the dangers and benefits of drugs", "Free Like ODB": "[Skit: RZA]\nThe body is a vehicle for the mind\nYou realize that your body, is basically vacumnin that space\nInto somethin from within this body\nThis is why the air must come in, every breath\nLook at -
